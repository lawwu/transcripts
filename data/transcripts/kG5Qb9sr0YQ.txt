[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.600]   My guest today is Dr. Mark Brackett.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.920]   Dr. Mark Brackett is a professor of psychology
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.200]   at Yale University,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.120]   and the Director of the Yale Center
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.640]   for Emotional Intelligence.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.340]   He is one of the world's foremost experts on emotions,
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.840]   meaning what emotions are
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   and how they regulate our relationship
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.780]   to ourself and others.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.840]   Today's discussion gets heavily into
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840]   how we should think about our emotions
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.040]   and the emotional expressions of others,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.940]   and when and how we should regulate those emotions.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.920]   This is a very important aspect of our life,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.320]   because as we all know,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.560]   emotions are present with us
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.320]   from the moment we are born until the moment we die.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.640]   So much like having a body,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360]   we need to learn how to work with our emotions
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.680]   in order to have the best quality of life.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.200]   We all know that we are supposed to pay attention
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.440]   to our emotions, but at the same time,
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.460]   we are often told that we shouldn't
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100]   take all of our emotions seriously,
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.960]   nor should we react to all of our emotions with behaviors.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.720]   And indeed, that is true.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.220]   What's been lacking, however,
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.680]   and what Dr. Mark Brackett finally delivers to us
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.100]   is a roadmap to think about our emotions
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.800]   in a very structured way,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.280]   and thereby to engage with our emotions,
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.720]   sometimes shift our emotions,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840]   and certainly to understand the emotional expressions
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   of others in ways that best serve our quality of life.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.200]   So today's discussion centers very heavily
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.360]   on scientific data that plays out in the real world
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.880]   that we can all use.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.920]   We talk about conflict resolution.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.400]   We talk about how to think about and work with emotions.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.840]   We talk about bullying, both in children and in adults,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   how to deal with that sort of thing effectively.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.680]   And we talk about emotional intelligence,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.660]   which it turns out can be increased at any stage of life.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.200]   So by the end of today's discussion,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.680]   you will be armed with a tremendous amount of new knowledge
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   and many new tools, many new protocols
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   that you can immediately apply in your life
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.000]   in order to improve your relationship
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.080]   to yourself and to others.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.840]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.520]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.560]   It is, however, a part of my desire and effort
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.840]   to the general public.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.080]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.840]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.640]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.520]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.120]   I consider doing regular therapy just as important
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.620]   as getting regular exercise.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.040]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.400]   that great therapy provides.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.760]   First of all, it provides good rapport
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.680]   with somebody that you can trust and talk to
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.160]   about the issues that are most critical to you.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.180]   Second of all, it can provide support
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.080]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.840]   And third, expert therapy should provide insights,
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.920]   insights that are useful in allowing you
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.120]   not just to feel better in your emotional life
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.140]   and your relationship life, but of course, to be better,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.360]   to be better in terms of the relationship to yourself,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.320]   your professional life, and to others,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.520]   and of course, to things like your career goals.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.080]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.680]   for you to find an expert therapist
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.560]   with whom you have these critical components of therapy.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.680]   Also, because BetterHelp allows for therapy
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.920]   to be done entirely online, it's very time-efficient
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.000]   and easy to fit into your busy schedule
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.820]   with no commuting to a therapist's office
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.860]   or looking for parking or sitting in a waiting room.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.280]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.040]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.320]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.360]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.200]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.640]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.080]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.160]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.580]   One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.080]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.480]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.520]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.980]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.680]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.600]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.560]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.080]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.840]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.000]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   and end of the night.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.180]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.840]   for well over three years now,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.080]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.320]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.720]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.600]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.760]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.920]   and it also has snoring detection
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.200]   that remarkably will automatically lift your head
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.320]   a few degrees to improve your airflow
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.440]   and stop your snoring.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.640]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.600]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.880]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.440]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.040]   I'm excited to share that I'll be speaking
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.340]   at a health summit called Eudaemonia,
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.560]   taking place in West Palm Beach, Florida
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.840]   this November 1st, 2024,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.560]   through the 3rd of November, 2024.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.020]   Eudaemonia is an in-person event
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.960]   that offers science-backed tools, live fitness classes,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.840]   and a range of treatments and protocols
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.440]   to optimize your physical and your mental health.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.640]   I'll be giving a keynote talk
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.880]   with none other than Dr. Gabrielle Lyon on Saturday.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.760]   As some of you may know,
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.160]   she's a former guest on the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.300]   and has a terrific podcast of her own.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.280]   That's going to be on November 2nd,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.620]   and we will discuss all things neuroscience
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.000]   and neuroplasticity.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   We'll talk about some of the benefits and protocols
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.520]   related to cognition and mood, and much more.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.080]   Also presenting at Eudaemonia
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.040]   are other excellent scientists and clinicians
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.120]   who've appeared on the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.360]   including Dr. Sarah Gottfried, Dr. Zachary Knight,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.560]   and Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.960]   along with nearly 70 other experts.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.080]   To see the full lineup of speakers and topics,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.120]   and to register, visit eudaemonia.net,

[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.620]   It's sure to be a terrific gathering,
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.900]   and I hope to see you there.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.080]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Mark Brackett.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   Dr. Mark Brackett, welcome.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.760]   - Thank you, great to be here.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.980]   - I'm excited to talk to you today
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.680]   about many things related to emotions.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.920]   We hear the word emotions,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.320]   and we have all sorts of ideas about what they are,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.600]   what they aren't.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.840]   We also hear about emotional intelligence
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.160]   quite a lot these days.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.800]   And I have a feeling that the way it's discussed
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.760]   is often not the way it really is.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.840]   So to just kick things off,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.640]   could you clarify for me, for everyone,
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.820]   what is emotional intelligence?
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.160]   What does it pertain to?
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then maybe we can use that as a way
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.240]   to drill into the deeper question of what are emotions.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   - Sure, I think, you know, at the simplest level,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.080]   it's how we reason with and about our emotions and feelings.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.840]   That's like the simple definition.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.480]   The way I talk about it is as a set of skills.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.580]   And we use the acronym RULER to describe those skills.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.320]   The first is recognizing emotions.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.800]   So I'm trying to read your facial expression right now,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.040]   right, are you interested or are you bored already?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.540]   I'm trying to understand emotions, where are they coming from?
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.920]   Like, why am I feeling this way?
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.760]   What's the consequence of that feeling?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   The third is labeling emotions.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.640]   So being precise with the words that we use
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.560]   to describe our feelings.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.480]   The fourth is expressing emotions,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.320]   knowing how and when to express emotions
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.360]   with different people across context and culture.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.360]   And then the big one is the final R,
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.280]   which is regulating emotions.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.040]   What are the strategies that we use
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.800]   to help us deal with everyday emotions?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.220]   - So if I were to take an emotional intelligence test,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.220]   would it have me looking at pictures of facial expressions?
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.640]   Would it have me reading paragraphs
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   about emotional exchanges and gauging
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.160]   who felt what and why and how?
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.120]   That sort of thing?
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.280]   - If you were to take a test from like 20 years ago, yes.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.360]   We try to be a little bit more innovative now
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.040]   in our measurement of the skills.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.360]   So for example, I just finished with a bunch of colleagues
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.000]   publishing a test of emotion perception,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.620]   but it's not static images.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.620]   It's video clips that are around three to four seconds
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.000]   that show subtle emotions.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.640]   It's about vocal tone.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.800]   It's about body language.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.640]   And we're trying to get people to accurately
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   kind of label these emotions in faces, body, and voice.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.280]   - When I think about most uses
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.000]   of the words emotional intelligence,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.320]   it seems to correlate, again, in a very non-scientific way,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.020]   seems to correlate with one's ability
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.360]   to tolerate others' emotions
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.060]   and make sense of the emotions of others.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.640]   For instance, I've heard it said before, not about me,
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.920]   that so-and-so has high emotional intelligence
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.680]   because in the presence of their child
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.880]   or someone else's kid reacting in a certain way,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.960]   they were able to see, ah, they just feel blank,
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.540]   and therefore they are screaming,
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.540]   as opposed to defaulting to a, you know,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.720]   broad binning of what they were observing and saying,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.400]   oh my goodness, that kid is a brat, for instance.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.380]   You're describing emotional intelligence
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.960]   as a self-perception as well.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.920]   - Yes.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.880]   - And so is our task, therefore,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.000]   to do the equivalent of what, in my little anecdote,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.040]   this other person was doing,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.380]   to be able to parse one's own emotions in a fine enough way
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.620]   to understand the experience in kind of a third-person way
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.480]   that one can regulate their behavior,
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.840]   what they say, how they act.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.400]   How much is recognition of others' emotions
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.760]   and understanding of those,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.740]   as opposed to one's recognition and understanding
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.160]   of their own emotions factoring into this thing
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.720]   that we call emotional intelligence?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.400]   - So the whole set of skills are intra and interpersonal.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.440]   That's really important.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.380]   It's about self and others always.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.520]   For example, right now,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.780]   we are co-regulating each other's emotions, right?
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.140]   Our facial expressions, our vocal tones,
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.600]   we're influencing how we each other, how we feel.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.840]   When you think about the recognition piece,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.220]   we'll just start there, right?
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.240]   There's self-awareness, like,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.200]   "Mark, how are you feeling right now?"
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.360]   And I'm having mixed emotions, right?
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.640]   This is a great podcast.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.920]   I wanna be articulate.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.400]   I'm excited, but I'm a little overwhelmed
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.740]   'cause I got so much I wanna share,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.680]   but I don't know how much I'm gonna share.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.240]   So there's all that awareness of my emotion.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.520]   Sometimes I have language for it.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.840]   Sometimes I don't, like any of us.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.320]   And that's why it starts off
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.300]   with kind of just a general awareness.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.320]   Like, am I pleasant?
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.960]   Am I unpleasant?
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.800]   Do I have a lot of energy?
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   Or do I feel depleted?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.240]   And we call that your core affect.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.740]   And then I could start asking myself questions like,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.520]   "Well, what are you doing right now, Mark?"
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.240]   "Well, I'm sitting across from Andrew being interviewed."
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.440]   "Oh, okay, well, how does that,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.560]   what comes up for you with that?"
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.720]   And then I try to label that feeling.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.640]   So that's like the R, the U, and the L
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.200]   of emotional intelligence for the self.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.720]   And I'm doing the same thing for you.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.160]   I'm looking at your facial expressions,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   your body language, I'm listening to you.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.920]   I'm trying to understand if I say something, do you shift?
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.520]   And I'm trying to put language to it.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.320]   So it's self and other.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.800]   - So given that we're both scientists
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.400]   interested in emotions, you're the expert.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.480]   I'm also just the student today.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.800]   I think it's worth pointing out to people
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   that there isn't one location in the brain
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.680]   that governs this complex process that you just described.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.560]   It's a network-wide phenomenon.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.080]   But you did mention the body.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.840]   You mentioned feeling, you know,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.440]   how is one feeling both in brain and body?
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   To what extent does somebody
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.940]   who has high emotional intelligence
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.940]   have more or less body awareness or somatic awareness
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.500]   as opposed to somebody who's "in their head"?
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.680]   Put differently, can somebody who's very much in their head
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.160]   who has very poor body awareness
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.480]   have high emotional intelligence?
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.160]   - Well, I think another big deal about emotional intelligence
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.760]   is that we like to think of it as,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.780]   or people think of it as this construct.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.600]   I don't think that's the best way to look at it.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.960]   I think it's much more interesting to look at it
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   as a set of discrete skills that come together.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.320]   They're not that highly correlated.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.720]   And so, you know, I really like to think of them
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.920]   as emotion skills, and that within the R, the U, the L,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.120]   the E, and the R that I described, there are sub-skills.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.200]   And so part of what you're talking about
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.600]   is the body awareness.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.360]   Some people are more cognitive, you know,
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.320]   they're just very language-oriented.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.800]   Some people, you know, a lot of therapists, somatic,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.500]   you know, talking about somatosensory things, all good.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.640]   I think at the end, though, you know,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.040]   this is why I teach this stuff,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.940]   is that we have to know how we feel.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.980]   We've got to know what we want to do with those feelings.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.340]   And we have to know how the people we live with and love
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.420]   and work with and teach, how they feel too.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.180]   And so we need language in the end.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.900]   - Some years ago, I went to this course.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.860]   It was, you know, broadly could be described
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.940]   as personal development.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.760]   It was interesting.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.900]   It was grounded in science and psychology.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.700]   And each day would start with going around the circle,
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.700]   as typically is done at these things.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.420]   And you'd have to say how you feel,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   but you couldn't use a valuation.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.780]   You couldn't say good or bad or so-so.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.180]   And I found it very difficult.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.140]   I found it difficult for a number of reasons.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.400]   First of all, I don't think I was ever trained
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.660]   to use specific language for my feelings.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.100]   In fact, I don't think I was ever trained
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.420]   to understand what feelings were.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.180]   In fact, I know neuroscientists and psychologists
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.480]   are still trying to figure out
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.540]   what feelings and emotions really are.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.780]   So a couple of questions.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.480]   When it comes to using language to describe our emotions,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.820]   how important do you feel it is
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.740]   to have a broad buffet of options?
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.560]   You know, a previous guest on this podcast,
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.700]   Lisa Feldman Barrett, and I talked about this a bit.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.360]   And she mentioned that in some cultures,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.920]   there's very specific language for specific emotions.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.740]   In fact, there's even a word to describe
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.740]   the feeling of sadness one has in a particular culture
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.620]   after getting a really bad haircut.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.980]   - Yeah.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.300]   - Which is incredible when one thinks about it.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.620]   - We all know what that feels like.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.300]   - Right, we know what it feels like, right.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.480]   But there isn't, to my knowledge-
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.320]   - We don't have the word.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.280]   - A word for that in the English language.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.980]   I mean, I'm sure there's a curse word for it
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.820]   in the English language. - Exactly.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.420]   - But not necessarily for that specific feeling
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.980]   or unique to that specific feeling.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.580]   So what is the relationship
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.420]   between language labels and emotion?
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.800]   And I ask that as a way to kind of wedge
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.740]   into the ruler approach, right?
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.780]   Because as you pointed out that one recognizes,
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.140]   understands labels, but the label is central,
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.540]   literally, to the ruler approach.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.100]   - It is.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.920]   Yeah, so I'm very similar to Lisa
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.740]   in terms of there are emotion concepts or categories.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.260]   Well, let's use the anger category.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.440]   If you only have one word for anger,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.440]   that means all you know is there's one form of anger.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.660]   But if you start teaching people,
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.380]   well, there are other words that we could use,
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.380]   like peeved, irritated, angry, enraged, livid.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.980]   And then you have rich conversations,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.380]   which is what I do in schools
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.240]   with kids and teachers themselves.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.380]   Like what is, when you're feeling peeved,
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.060]   like what are the things that make you feel peeved
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.620]   versus the things that make you feel enraged?
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.780]   What does it feel like in your body
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.980]   when you're feeling that way?
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.980]   Granted that everybody feels things differently
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.180]   in their bodies, that really doesn't matter.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.940]   What matters is that we have a common language
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.820]   and a common understanding of what these emotions are.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.620]   Because otherwise we can't communicate.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.580]   You know, I'm really, like this is a big deal for me
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.260]   in terms of having a common language
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.380]   within a community to talk about emotion.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.380]   Because right now, right, we're in a crisis of anxiety.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.320]   I'm not 100% bought into that.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   I think that people use the word anxiety improperly.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.020]   Anxiety is about uncertainty about the future,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.320]   if we're gonna define it.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.780]   It's different than stress.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.940]   You know, there's different forms of stress, as you know.
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.580]   But the distress, right, is usually
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.460]   when you have too many demands and not enough resources.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.300]   Which is different than when you're overwhelmed, right?
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.420]   Which is my emotion of the year,
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.740]   which is I'm just saturated, like, you know,
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.140]   I can't even figure out what's going on anymore.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.460]   Which is also different from fear.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.820]   And that's, we call that emotion differentiation
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.420]   or granularity, people call it.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.620]   They're slightly different.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.740]   The differentiation is like between emotions
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.800]   and the granularity might be within the emotion.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   But from my work, just to go on about this for a moment,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.200]   the best example I have is I do a lot of corporate training.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.680]   And so I'm in a room filled with lawyers or executives
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.240]   and I ask them how they're feeling.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.640]   Nobody's really sure how they're feeling,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   like you were saying.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.660]   And then I'll do these little kind of quizzes with them.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.500]   Tell me the difference.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.320]   You got three minutes in a group.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.300]   Anxiety, stress, pressure, fear, overwhelmed.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.800]   And they come back and the number one response is,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.660]   they're all the same.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.940]   And I'm like, really?
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.780]   Take another few minutes.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.660]   Like, just try to define them.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.860]   They can't even define them.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.580]   They say things like, you know, one is internal,
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.460]   one is external, one is higher energy and lower energy.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.300]   I'm like, I get that, but what do these concepts mean to you?
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.820]   What do they mean to you?
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.780]   Anyhow, finally we get to like the definitions.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.900]   And then I say, you know, who cares?
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.300]   Like, why am I asking you to understand these differences?
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.740]   Go back to your groups and talk about it.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.100]   And then after like, this is like a 45 minute,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.000]   like I thought this was gonna be like a two minute activity.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.240]   It turns into like a 45 minute to an hour exercise
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.960]   because they finally realize, oh yeah.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   So if I'm anxious because I'm worrying about the future,
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.560]   you know, maybe the breathing exercise
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.520]   is not gonna be as helpful
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.240]   because maybe I need a cognitive strategy to say,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   you know, Mark, stop worrying about the stock market.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.640]   Mark, stop worrying about the university closed down
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.480]   because of the pandemic.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.040]   You've got no control over the university's decisions.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.180]   And so helping people make connections
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.220]   between the feeling and the reason for the feeling,
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.280]   from my perspective has been very helpful
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.880]   to help them learn how to regulate the emotion.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.160]   - So connecting the feeling and the reason for the feeling.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.000]   - Correct.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.440]   - As opposed to just labeling the feeling.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.560]   - Yeah, you need to know why.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.120]   It's the why that you really have to deal with.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.520]   - How do you feel about emojis?
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.120]   From everything you're saying,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.040]   they seem like more than benign to me.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.880]   - Yeah, same.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.260]   I could imagine that the emojification of culture,
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.900]   as I refer to it, I don't think that's a real word.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.740]   - It's all right.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.140]   - All right, it is now.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.820]   Set up a Wikipedia page tomorrow.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.180]   Emojification is a serious problem
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.260]   because it's what we call in science, too much lumping.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.500]   In science we have lumpers and splitters, right?
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.460]   And both can have fabulous careers,
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.620]   but if you lump too much or split too much,
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.660]   you create more confusion and you often create problems.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.660]   And I just see emojis as lumping this incredible set
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.260]   of different continuums within us that we call emotions.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.100]   - Exactly.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.380]   - Into literally a small icon.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.220]   And I can imagine this would lead to all sorts of problems,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.500]   not just in communication,
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.300]   but in understanding our own emotions.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.460]   Put differently, do you think that the use of emojis
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.220]   has degraded our level of emotional intelligence
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.740]   and processing?
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.940]   I mean, I haven't done the research,
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.460]   but from my perspective, it's not helpful
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.980]   because the goal is to get granular.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.140]   Think about the difference,
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.460]   and I'm not gonna quiz you right now,
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.900]   but anger and disappointment.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.700]   Do you know that 95% of the people
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.820]   that I asked to define those two things cannot do it?
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.540]   - Yeah, I mean, right off the cuff I'll just say,
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.220]   I'm familiar with both of those feelings.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.460]   I know they're different, I can sense their difference,
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.660]   but the disappointment piece could be directed outward
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.500]   or inward.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.180]   I'd have to work systematically through
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.140]   until I found a violation of one or the other.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.820]   So where an example applied to one and not the other,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.900]   and it would take me a few minutes,
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.620]   longer than I want this audience to have to wait.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.460]   - There you go.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.740]   So we should just-- - So I got an F.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.980]   (laughing)
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.700]   - But you have a growth mindset, so you're okay.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.060]   - There you go, yeah.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.540]   - But the, you know, so disappointment,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.580]   I met expectations.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.540]   Everything was legit, it just didn't work out.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.620]   Anger, perceived injustice.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.140]   And that's a really important distinction,
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.580]   because if you're a parent or someone at work
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.340]   and someone is like yelling and screaming,
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.180]   firstly, we grossly, you know, make mistakes
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.820]   in terms of labeling emotion from behavior.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.260]   We gotta just throw that out.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.500]   There's no correlation really between behavior and emotion.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.260]   I can stop my feet, you know, as a boy
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.780]   because I'm feeling sad,
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.820]   just because it's more culturally acceptable
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.460]   for me to stomp than to cry.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.460]   And so why are you so angry?
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.300]   Maybe I'm feeling shame, which is my experience.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.140]   You know, I was yelling and screaming as a kid
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.100]   'cause I was being bullied so much.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.500]   And then my mother would be like,
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.220]   you know, who do you think you are talking to me that way?
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.300]   And then my father would say, go to your room.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.740]   And I'd be like, is anybody reading my, you know,
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.100]   emotions properly or asking me how I'm feeling?
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.620]   Because you would know that I'm acting out
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.140]   because of fear and shame.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.460]   Never happened because of a variety of reasons of,
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.700]   you know, triggering my parents
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.260]   and they didn't have such high emotional intelligence.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.100]   They loved me,
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.300]   just didn't have high emotional intelligence.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.300]   And so going back to the anger disappointment one,
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.940]   unmet expectations versus perceived injustice.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.460]   And so when you think about it in terms of the strategy,
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.180]   like for example, my other career,
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.460]   Justina was as a martial arts teacher.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.660]   So I have a fifth degree black belt
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.940]   and a Korean martial art called Hapkido.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.940]   Except this podcast doesn't go so well.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.620]   Anyhow, the, you know,
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.100]   I was an awkward kid, had a, you know,
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.340]   very insecure, low self-esteem.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.740]   I got into the martial arts.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.940]   I thought, I'm going to get my yellow belt
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.980]   and I'm going to feel tough and proud.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.820]   Failed my freaking yellow belt test.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.460]   I mean, at 13 years old, you couldn't imagine like,
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.260]   there's nothing worse for a 13 year old kid
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.980]   who's feeling shame and being bullied
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.700]   to fail a yellow belt test.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.540]   So what do I do?
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.660]   I go home, I hate karate.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.860]   I'm never going back to karate.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.620]   Everybody's in uproar.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.460]   I'm getting yelled at.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.380]   I'm paying for your karate.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.580]   You're going back to, you know, whatever.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.860]   And the truth was like,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.100]   let's think about that for a minute.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.220]   So I go to take the test
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.460]   and I've got to do my blocks and my kicks.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.340]   You know, my punches.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.700]   I know there's five kicks, there's five punches.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.780]   And let's say I do them the best I can,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.860]   but the sensei just says, you know, Mark,
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.060]   just not good enough.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.940]   You know, you're not ready yet.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.340]   That's legitimate disappointment.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.900]   I expected to pass.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.740]   I didn't pass.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.340]   I'm feeling disappointed.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.580]   So the strategy for that is what?
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.220]   Like, tutor, help.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.500]   Show me what I have to do better.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.740]   On the other hand, let's say, which was true for me,
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.420]   that some of the kids who were the bullies
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.620]   in my middle school also took karate.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.460]   And let's imagine they're watching me take my test
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.980]   and they're giving me some dirty looks
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.900]   because they're gonna, you know, threaten me.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.980]   And which did happen, you know, you know,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.340]   getting changed, going, you know, like,
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.460]   wait till you see what it's going to be like
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.700]   for you tomorrow on the way to school.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.140]   Now, how am I feeling?
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.260]   Terrorized, fearful.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.420]   And I failed my test because of that.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.980]   So you can see how I could show up
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.420]   with a particular behavior.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.300]   When people are attributing emotion to me,
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.940]   they're labeling my emotions for me
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.500]   because they don't have the skill
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.580]   to deactivate as a parent or a teacher or a partner,
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.100]   to be present, to help me understand my experience
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.860]   and then label my experience,
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.460]   understand where it's coming from
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.220]   and then strategize accordingly.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.460]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.100]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.660]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.700]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.140]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.220]   all of your foundational nutritional needs
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.380]   and it tastes great.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.140]   Now, I've been drinking AG1 since 2012
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.580]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.060]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.900]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.260]   to purchase one supplement
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.300]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.700]   The reason for that is even though I strive to eat
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.380]   most of my foods from whole foods
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.180]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.180]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.900]   vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.100]   micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.980]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.780]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.240]   I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.740]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.420]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.980]   my physical health, my mental health and my performance,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.200]   both cognitive and physical are better.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.780]   I know that because I've had lapses
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.020]   when I didn't take AG1
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.880]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.900]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.980]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.460]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.880]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.020]   and again, later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.180]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.620]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.740]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.100]   to claim a special offer.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.360]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.900]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.380]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.780]   to claim that special offer.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.900]   - You said that disappointment is
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.640]   when one does everything essentially correctly,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.060]   meaning gave as much effort as they could, et cetera,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.460]   and it didn't work out.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.300]   - Correct.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.820]   - Versus anger, which is perceived injustice.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.640]   - Yeah.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.580]   - Would you say that your response
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.340]   to not getting your yellow belt then,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.140]   because as a fifth degree black belt now,
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.460]   clearly you got that yellow belt eventually.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.960]   I wanna hear that part of the story too.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.560]   That you were experiencing anger,
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.120]   in this case, could we even call it inappropriate anger?
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.800]   Simply inappropriate because what you really needed
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.840]   to understand was this notion of disappointment,
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.240]   but no one had taught it to you.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.640]   - I think what you're getting at though,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.960]   is this like not knowing how you're feeling,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.600]   'cause I was never taught language, right?
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.800]   And having an experience that is,
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.160]   could be many feelings at once,
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.320]   which is, could be disappointment, could be anger,
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.180]   could be embarrassment,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.280]   but you gotta unpack the situation.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.680]   What was the real event that happened?
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.360]   What really happened in that moment?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.080]   And so, if it were legitimate, like legitimate test,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.400]   and I just, I blocked the punch
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.880]   and I just didn't have the strength to block it,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.900]   to really stand firm, it's disappointment.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.120]   It's like, son, you thought your blocks were strong,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.220]   unfortunately, you need some work.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.300]   Let's practice every day after school together,
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.400]   we're gonna get these blocks down
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.320]   so you can get that yellow belt test, there's no other reason.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.880]   If it's because the bullies are staring at me,
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.600]   and I'm not capable of dealing with those piercing eyes
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.120]   that are at me, and I'm feeling so anxious and overwhelmed
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.540]   that I just can't block because I'm just freaked out,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.280]   that's a whole nother story.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.360]   Do you see how like a parent or a teacher
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   would have to really differentiate their support,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.000]   but you have to really get at the experience,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.360]   which means we have to have relationships
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.320]   that are trustworthy, loving, caring with all people,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.420]   because otherwise we don't build that connection
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.120]   to really understand how people feel.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.520]   We just take the kind of behavior,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.120]   we're like, why are you behaving that way?
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.520]   You know, go to your room or, you know, just practice.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.860]   It's like, no, like, I've been bullied at school
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.840]   and now the bully is threatening me.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.240]   Like that's serious stuff that needs to be taken care of.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.440]   - Yeah, online emojis and, you know,
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.120]   downward facing thumbs versus upward facing thumbs
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.160]   and this kind of thing, and, you know,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.760]   vomit emojis and things like that, a mind blown.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.440]   I'm starting to realize that these may be doing
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.280]   far more harm than we realize.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   - Yeah, I think it's fun.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   You know, and maybe it's just,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.840]   if you'd wanna just use it for fun, not a problem.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.280]   If we're gonna use it to really communicate, not so great.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.560]   - I'm thinking of instances
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.280]   where people are just using these
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.960]   with the intention of expressing
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.000]   their like dislike of something,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.320]   but that the people on the receiving end
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   experience a lot of self-criticism as a consequence,
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.440]   mostly kids, but adults too.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.360]   And I know some adults that really can't handle
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.380]   somebody commenting on their Instagram posts,
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.800]   like big L or something like that.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.640]   - Yeah, it's devastating for people.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.160]   - Or nope, or this kind of thing.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.640]   It's also interesting because I see it
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.320]   even in the academic community,
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.360]   especially on Twitter X, where I know that,
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.080]   sure, people reject each other's papers,
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.120]   critique each other's papers,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.220]   but they do that with a degree of intellectual nuance
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.160]   that transmits a sense of care, right?
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.320]   If scientists really care,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.720]   then they're gonna do a careful review
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.080]   as much as we would all love the,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.680]   this is a perfect paper, that's it, no critique.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.520]   When somebody critiques something that we do
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.160]   with an attention to detail, provided it's fair,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.840]   we feel cared for.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.920]   - Totally. - They care for the work
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.760]   and we care for the work.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.360]   And so there's a relationship there,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.280]   even if it's an anonymous review.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.420]   But I'm shocked to see how scientific colleagues
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.360]   I've known for decades,
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.400]   really how they comport themselves online,
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.500]   like they'll swear, they'll come out,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.840]   they won't bother to punctuate things.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.140]   They'll just sort of behave in a very,
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.700]   what seems to be a very activated way.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.140]   Not all of them, of course,
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.860]   but it's been very interesting.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.680]   The words that come to mind are,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.220]   I feel like online, especially on social media,
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.580]   the kids are acting like adults
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.700]   and the adults are acting like children.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.820]   And so there seems to be a kind of regression
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.620]   toward what I'm calling the emojification
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.620]   or the kind of high amplitude expression with blunt tools.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.820]   I don't know what that is because I know these people,
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.580]   the reason I'm using the academic community as an example,
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.420]   by the way, it's cost some of these people, their jobs,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.860]   chairs of departments,
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.700]   not at Stanford or Yale, fortunately.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.860]   But it's kind of striking to me
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.780]   the way that when we remove the face-to-face connection,
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:08.420]   when people will behave that way.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.820]   And I use the parallel example of anonymous review
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.080]   because there it's anonymous.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.780]   So in theory, they could behave however they want,
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.980]   but there's an etiquette.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.640]   So it seems like online etiquette is very deprived
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.340]   of many of the important features
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.920]   that you're starting to lay out for us here.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.940]   - Anonymity causes challenges.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.300]   It's funny 'cause I gave a speech at Twitter,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.420]   now known as X, about five years ago,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.500]   and had analyzed quite a lot of data.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.580]   It was actually the year that Mariah Carey sang
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.280]   and it got messed up.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.020]   And it was like the week before I was going in January,
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.020]   it was like New Year's Eve.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.300]   And I just was curious 'cause it really was a mess up.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.260]   And I said, "How are people gonna respond?"
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:00.260]   And it was 99.99% ripping this amazing diva to shreds.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.380]   - So she, I don't recall this incident.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.240]   So she's obviously phenomenally talented,
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.820]   but she made an error.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.660]   - There was something with the mic.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.480]   - God forbid she made an error.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.320]   - Yeah, there was something with the mic.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.580]   - Or someone else, oh goodness.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.220]   - You know, and she just basically like,
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.620]   the mic wasn't working the way she wanted it to work.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.660]   And she's like, "I'm out of here, I'm not singing."
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.900]   And you should have seen how people just,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.020]   I mean, millions and millions and millions of comments,
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.060]   you know, like, and I'm not gonna repeat what people said
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.100]   'cause it was really disgusting.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.420]   And I got really curious, like, what about things like,
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.860]   "Gosh, you've like won 15 Grammy Awards,
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.880]   "like this must really sting for you."
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.980]   Maybe one post like that.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.780]   And so it does make you wonder about,
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.620]   A, the type of person who is interested in commenting.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.180]   Like we may have a bias there.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.220]   I do think we have a bias there.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.260]   You know, people who, you know,
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.260]   they feel protected by, you know, something.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.100]   If it's, you know, a more famous person in politics,
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.860]   obviously people are very clear how they feel.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.900]   - Politicians sort of open themselves up to it.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.020]   - Yeah, they do.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.940]   - Public facing people in general,
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.460]   I've heard, open themselves up to it.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.700]   But politicians in particular,
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.220]   I think we give, we sort of give the general public a pass
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.020]   to say almost anything about them.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.820]   But it's not pretty.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.140]   - It's not pretty and it's not emotionally intelligent
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.980]   to go back to the concept, right?
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.300]   It's like, what's your goal here?
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.500]   Like, I always ask people that,
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.020]   like, what are you getting out of being nasty?
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.900]   - I perceive it as evacutive.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.220]   I look at that and I think,
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.620]   "Gosh, what they must feel inside
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.900]   "to be able to say those things can't be good."
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.500]   But maybe it feels good to them, I don't know.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.460]   I don't think I've ever made a negative comment.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.060]   If I have, someone can call me out on it.
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.300]   Hopefully it was in sarcasm with a friend as the target
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.900]   and they were okay with it or happy with it.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.620]   But I don't know what internal emotional
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.780]   or psychological state it would take
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.900]   to go say something cruel to somebody online.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.260]   - In my earlier research with Facebook,
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.180]   we analyzed millions and millions of posts.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:15.020]   And people can be intentionally mean and hurtful.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.420]   Just people wanna rip people to shreds
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.980]   and they wanna instill fear.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.660]   And it's very hard to disentangle that too,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.500]   just to be honest.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.060]   So like, what we found in our research was that,
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.420]   I could say if you're like,
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.340]   Andrew's wearing a black shirt, you'll see that.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.220]   I could say like, "Nice shirt."
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.700]   And it might mean nice shirt
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.700]   or it might mean, "I'm making fun of your shirt."
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.180]   And it's just hard, like that's the problem
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.020]   with social media in terms of posts.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.020]   We don't really know,
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.780]   'cause the person who's receiving it has a story, right?
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.420]   That was one challenge we found
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.100]   around like getting posts taken down,
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.820]   was that it was hard to have that objective criterion
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.740]   of what was painful to a person.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.980]   Which is why what we tried to do
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.420]   was help the person who was receiving the content
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.580]   communicate in a way with the person who posted the content
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.420]   to get them to take it down.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.660]   And what we found was that it actually worked really well.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.820]   If you taught a teenager, for example,
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.660]   to say, "Hey, you know, hey, Andrew,
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.700]   like that comment you made really was hurtful.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.900]   Would you please take it down?"
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.460]   We were more likely to get people to take it down.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.660]   And what we found in experimental research was that,
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.500]   if we just let people go on their own devices,
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.620]   it tended to be more retaliatory.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.420]   Like, "Who the heck do you think you are?"
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.700]   You wanna fight back, you know?
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.280]   And that did not motivate the person to take it down.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.620]   So even meeting gross behavior with compassion
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.860]   can be helpful.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.460]   - Can we provide a counterexample
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.540]   for the anger versus disappointment
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.260]   that's on the positive valence side?
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.500]   What's a positive set of feelings
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.020]   that people often conflate?
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.720]   - Like happiness and contentment.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.220]   - Yeah, that's a tough one.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.960]   I'm getting Fs all around, you know?
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.340]   Good thing I became a biologist.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.660]   - Ecstatic and elated.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:16.180]   - Cool, yeah, okay.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.380]   - Yeah, this is, you know, this is why I do what I do.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.300]   - Yeah, so-- - And so I'm good at this.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.460]   - Yeah, yes, you are.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.220]   - You know, when you think about happiness,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.860]   you know, it's usually about, you know,
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.580]   when you're achieving something, right?
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.180]   You're gonna, I'm gonna be happy when, you know,
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.620]   this will bring me happiness.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.020]   Contentment is the opposite.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.340]   Contentment is everything is just great as it is.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.780]   I feel complete.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.500]   I have enough.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.420]   And part of my argument against the happiness research
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.780]   is that we don't spend enough time
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.020]   helping people strive for contentment
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.940]   and we push people to strive for happiness,
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.600]   which there's research to show, you know, backfires.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.580]   You know, if you're waking up every day saying,
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.580]   what am I gonna do today to be happy?
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.300]   What am I gonna do today to be happy?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.540]   Chances are, you know, it's not gonna work out a lot.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.420]   And that kind of backfires to create more despair.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.500]   - Yeah, sorry to interrupt,
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.420]   but I, as soon as you described contentment that way,
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.060]   and thank you for parsing those two, very useful to me.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.700]   As soon as you described contentment that way,
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.260]   I imagine waking up and rather than thinking about
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.380]   what needs to be done and the things I want to achieve,
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.060]   which I want to achieve, they bring me joy.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.900]   - Yeah.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.280]   - I'm throwing a third word there just to confuse myself.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.800]   This notion of contentment, the way that you described,
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.100]   I could see might lead me to pay attention to
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.620]   how good it feels to have gotten some sleep,
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.380]   to, you know, I sleep well most nights,
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.140]   but what a privilege that is.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.660]   And to, you know, maybe feel the comfort of the comforter
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.620]   and the mattress for a moment before barging into the day.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.460]   - Yeah.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.940]   - To chase happiness, as it were.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.780]   - Exactly.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.600]   I think, you know, the idea that we have to be happy
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.420]   all the time is also ridiculous.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.280]   I mean, I'm a neurotic professor, like I'm never happy.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.040]   You know, it's just, it's tough.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.620]   And so, and also like, I don't know about you,
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.340]   but given that my dispositional affect, another term,
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.340]   you know, is more on the lower energy,
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.760]   kind of contented, a little anxiety.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.060]   When I'm around the people who are like high energy
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.180]   and pleasant all the time, I have a difficult time.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.180]   You know, it's like-
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.420]   - Because you somehow feel like you're not living up
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.260]   to some standards.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.500]   - No, I just feel like overwhelmed and smothered by it.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.340]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.100]   - You know, it's like, stop being so happy all the time.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.300]   - Here's where I get to appropriately make a joke about,
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.700]   because before we started, we were talking about
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.620]   East Coast schools versus West Coast schools.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.420]   I was like, maybe you come West and that'll change,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.700]   or maybe you're right where you belong there
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.580]   at the also phenomenal university that is Yale.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.460]   But anyway, that's kind of inside ball stuff.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.660]   East Coast University is amazing.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.940]   Midwest University is amazing.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.460]   West Coast University is amazing.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.180]   Different perceived temperaments, but-
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.380]   - For sure.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.420]   - And styles, just look at the walking speeds,
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.260]   for instance, not just the weather.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.400]   But yeah, you raise a very important point.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.960]   We have a member of our podcast team
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.220]   that is like always in a great mood.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.620]   He's always in a great mood.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.740]   And it is for me, a reminder to be in a better mood.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.860]   I'm not somebody that I would say gets, I'm not moody.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.700]   I don't change moods quickly,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.580]   but I wouldn't say that my disposition is to be
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.500]   like Tigger-like and just happy all the time.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.900]   But his energy around that doesn't drain me,
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.700]   but it makes me wish I was him.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.660]   - That's good. That's okay. That's you.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.880]   Like the part of, I mean,
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.940]   part of being emotionally intelligent with colleagues,
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.900]   you know, romantic partners, with children, whoever,
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.420]   is picking up on that.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.420]   Like now that I know that about you,
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.260]   it makes me think differently about you
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.220]   in terms of what your needs are.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   That's emotional intelligence.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.260]   And for me, I am like, I wake up every morning,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.940]   like having an existential crisis.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.180]   I'm like, what am I doing with my life?
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.900]   And you know, what am I doing this today for?
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.060]   And then I got to publish this paper.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:04.900]   I got to finish my book.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.520]   I got to run my team.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.980]   Like what do I want to do?
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.060]   And you know, then I'm doing it.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.500]   And then I'm like, when I'm doing one thing,
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.700]   I think I should be doing the other thing.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.660]   This is just who I am.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.780]   And it's, I've tried everything.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.640]   And it's just, that's my operating system.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.900]   I'm more aware, like when I was,
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.540]   I'm working on another book.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.660]   And as I was working on it, you know,
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.460]   I'm in a chapter, and all I could think about
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.140]   is the next chapter.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.900]   And then I started like, Mark,
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.660]   give yourself permission to be with this freaking chapter.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.700]   It's okay.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.380]   Like, you can focus on one thing
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.540]   and not worry about the future.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.820]   And I had to literally kind of do that for myself.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.300]   That's how I am, you know?
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.700]   And so knowing that about myself is useful
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:51.540]   because it helps me find the strategies that work for me.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.700]   And going back to the happiness thing,
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.100]   it's because I'm also introverted.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.140]   And so when I'm around extroverts a lot, I'm drained.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.260]   You know, I just, like after something like this,
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.820]   this is an intense conversation,
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.580]   I'm not gonna go to a sports bar, you know,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.140]   like have a beer and like watch the game.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.420]   I would never do that anyway.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.380]   But anyway, that's just not my thing.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.520]   You know, like that would make me,
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.380]   I would like, my brain would be burnt.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.940]   Like my dream would be to leave here,
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.740]   go take a hot yoga class and take a walk,
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.560]   have a glass of wine, maybe by myself or with a friend,
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.620]   and then end the day.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.500]   - All those things are readily available
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.600]   within less than a mile of here.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.980]   We can point you in the right direction.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.020]   It sounds lovely.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.580]   The introversion, extroversion bit
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.160]   is going to prick up people's ears.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.260]   It certainly did mine.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.920]   I like time alone.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.720]   I also like time alone in the presence of many people.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.620]   In fact, I get my best work done always,
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.620]   either alone in nature or in Manhattan,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.040]   where there are people around me,
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.300]   but I'm completely isolated.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.680]   - I love that too.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.600]   - So how should we think about introversion and extroversion?
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.000]   These things get thrown around so much in popular culture.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.320]   Are there some solid scientific studies
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.800]   that support that introversion can best be defined
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.000]   as blank and extroversion as blank?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.760]   And I'm guessing there's a range there.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.960]   It's got to be on a continuum.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.280]   It can't be two bins.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.840]   - I mean, for some people, it's very clear.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.880]   You know, they are a clear, traded introvert.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.920]   And for some people, they're just like endlessly extroverted
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.680]   no matter, they wake up wanting to be with people.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.000]   They, at the end of the day,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   they want to go out with people more.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.360]   And so what research shows, for example,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.120]   with creative people is they tend to be both.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.520]   They tend to be high introverts and high extroverts,
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.440]   which is interesting, right?
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.320]   They're introverts when they're doing their art
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.240]   and then they're extroverts
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.320]   when they're out there selling their art,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.760]   which is hard for some artists, right?
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.400]   Because a lot of artists are kind of introspective
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.320]   and they're creative types,
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.760]   but they really struggle with getting out there
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   and being that extroverted, like, look at my art.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.040]   And so you're the lucky artist
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.280]   if you are traded in both directions.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   I think the easiest way to think about it is just,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.120]   it's a proclivity, right?
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.240]   It's a proclivity to how you want to use your energy.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.840]   And the introvert is more a container,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.080]   wants to contain their energy.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.040]   They want to be in small groups.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.560]   They want kind of less frenetic environments.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.280]   And the extrovert just has a proclivity
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.160]   for more sensation-seeking, larger social groups.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.000]   And again, it's a preference.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.160]   I always say I'm an introvert
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.080]   with pretty good social skills.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.800]   Like I can appear to be extroverted.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   Most people think I'm outgoing.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.240]   And I always tell, like, I don't even like people that much.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.600]   - You seem very outgoing.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.680]   - Yeah, I'm not.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.520]   You know, it's just not, it's not my natural,
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.540]   like if I'm at a party, I struggle with like,
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.840]   like, what am I going to do here?
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.600]   - When you say you don't necessarily like people that much,
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.920]   I realize you're joking.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.760]   But, and I was just going to make sure to ask,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.080]   'cause I can't presume,
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   that doesn't mean that you dislike people.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.920]   It's just that being in the presence of a lot of people
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.720]   doesn't draw you out to want to be closer to
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.800]   or get to know all these people
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.960]   simply because they're there.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.880]   Whereas an extrovert seems to really like forming
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.720]   and engaging in new relationships, old relationships,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.920]   all relationships, relating.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.000]   - Exactly, if you're like running a campaign
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.040]   to run for, you know, mayor of your town,
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:30.880]   like you're going to,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.360]   you want to hire an extroverted PR person, right?
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.160]   An extroverted person do marketing
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.400]   'cause they're like going to be out there
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.320]   really banging on the door,
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.280]   it's not very comfortable talking to people, right?
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.960]   The introvert is going to be better at doing the accounting,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.640]   you know, and doing the planning.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.240]   And we've done this research actually,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.840]   if even fun with my students,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.240]   I would have them take their,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.080]   take measures of their valid measures
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.600]   of introversion and extroversion.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.200]   I would score them into groups,
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.000]   like get that really extroverted group
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.680]   and the really introverted group,
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.600]   and I'd have them plan a party.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.160]   Just go plan a party.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.320]   And the group of extroverts is bonfires,
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.080]   there's beer, there loud music on the beach.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.400]   And the introverts are like,
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.480]   we had to make sure we have good napkins.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.800]   We want to, you know, we're going to have four people,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.240]   you know, it's going to be quiet music.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.040]   That's just, you know, how we're built.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.520]   - Interesting, when I think of throwing a great party,
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.840]   and I've thrown a few,
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.640]   what I like to think were great parties,
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.720]   it involves inviting a bunch of people over
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.600]   and then being able to stand back from a lot of it
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.320]   and not have to participate in all of it.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.120]   I just like seeing friends that didn't know each other
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.400]   start to interact.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.440]   - That's cool.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.320]   - That's fun for me.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.160]   And then if I have to communicate directly
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.400]   with too many people at the party,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.440]   I would definitely feel drained.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.680]   I'm known to retreat to a room and take a nap or--
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.800]   - Yeah, so maybe you are more introverted.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.760]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.920]   Rick Rubin, who's world renowned
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.320]   for his creative insights and creativity,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.280]   and for being Rick,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.520]   I think once said on a podcast perhaps,
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.600]   or maybe he said this to me,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.680]   that Tom Petty was the sort of person
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.720]   that basically didn't do anything
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.520]   besides write music and read books
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.080]   and interact with the small number of people
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   in his inner circle.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.080]   And the idea of leaving the house
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.200]   was just completely overwhelming to him.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.520]   Now, of course, people were always approaching him,
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.840]   but like really, really extreme introvert.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.960]   Whereas Rick has described, and I won't name names here,
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.640]   other famous people, musicians and otherwise,
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.440]   that go out specifically
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.520]   to try and get the attention of fame.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.720]   And if they don't, they feel absolutely isolated.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.560]   - Makes sense.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.000]   - Even though they have people in their private life,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.840]   it's sort of like,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.360]   it becomes a kind of extroversion requirement.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.160]   I would imagine life is much harder
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.560]   for the extrovert in the long run,
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.400]   because there's so much need there.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.000]   - The research shows that the extroverts tend to do,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.240]   have a little bit more success,
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.960]   because they're more willing to get out there
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.400]   and ask for it.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.880]   They get raises more quickly.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.800]   - I see.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.480]   - And in my work in schools,
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.840]   I always ask teachers to pay attention
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.600]   to the personality of their students,
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.080]   because the introvert has a lot of great ideas.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.480]   They're just not dying to raise their hand
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.640]   and get the attention.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.280]   So don't just call on the kids who are raising their hands,
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.200]   because you're missing out on getting some great information.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.480]   - In that case, do you cold call on people?
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   Whenever I'm teaching,
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.720]   I'm somewhat reluctant to cold call on people,
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.680]   because I recall it can be terrifying
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.240]   when suddenly you're sitting there taking notes,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.600]   trying to organize your thoughts around the material,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.680]   and then suddenly the whole room's looking at you.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.440]   - I mean, I set expectations around that,
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.880]   'cause I'm really particular about that,
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.520]   because it drives me crazy
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.080]   when the talkative extrovert
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.680]   is always getting their thing said.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.240]   I think there's good instructional practices
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.600]   that can help with that.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.880]   One thing I'm thinking about, though,
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.680]   is this intersection of personality
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.240]   and emotional intelligence.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.760]   You just kind of brought that up for me,
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.320]   which is, and people confuse those a lot.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.680]   So for example, I even confused it when I was younger,
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.200]   before I studied it,
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.640]   because I'm high also in neuroticism,
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.400]   meaning I am more mercurial
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.360]   in terms of I worry about things,
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.200]   and I'm fine, then I worry again.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.920]   It just, that's who I am.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.680]   And I just always assumed
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.400]   that someone who is high in neuroticism,
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.320]   or more, as I said, kind of volatile emotionally,
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.520]   that was this low emotional intelligence,
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.240]   because how could you be emotionally intelligent
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.760]   if you're emotionally volatile?
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.880]   And then I did all this research
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.480]   and found there's pretty much no correlation
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.280]   between personality traits and emotional intelligence.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.560]   And why is that?
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.960]   Well, think about it.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.520]   If you're someone who is more even-keeled,
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.800]   maybe you don't even have that much of an opportunity
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.520]   to regulate your emotions, right?
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.360]   But then, if you get triggered,
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.400]   you've never had experience,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.440]   so it's actually harder for you.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.880]   Someone like me, I'm practicing it all the time, right?
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.920]   I'm always like, I'm in a bad mood,
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.960]   and I gotta give a meeting.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.080]   I'm irritable, I gotta give a presentation.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.880]   So I'm constantly figuring out
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.560]   how to deal with my emotions.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.440]   And that's why they're separate concepts.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.600]   And in addition to it, just to build on this,
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.800]   knowing your personality traits
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.960]   can be extraordinarily helpful
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.960]   for choosing the best strategies to regulate your emotions.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.200]   Why is that?
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.640]   I was traveling in Australia recently,
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.480]   and I gave this speech to a group of people.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.000]   The person who was the person in charge of the speech,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.040]   it was about an hour from Melbourne.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.520]   And I took the train,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.280]   'cause I preferred to stay in the city,
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.480]   took the train, I was planning to take,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.120]   I had bought my train ticket back.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.600]   The convener said, "You know, Mark,
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.000]   I just really would love to be with you,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.680]   and can we just, you know,
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.160]   can I drive you back to your hotel?"
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.520]   And I'm thinking to myself, like,
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.600]   that is the worst thing you could ever ask me.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.000]   - And on the wrong side of the road.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   - Yeah.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.080]   And I had my train ticket.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.600]   I really, it was a full day of presentations and stuff.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.400]   I really wanted to be by myself to decompress,
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.520]   but I felt bad and I said, "Sure."
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.680]   The guy talked to me for an hour,
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.560]   like he would just non-stop talk to me.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.880]   I got back to my hotel, I was like,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.200]   I am gonna have a nervous breakdown.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.560]   Like, I need another day to recover because,
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.200]   and it just, it annoyed me about myself
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.560]   not practicing, you know, what I teach,
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.520]   which was, "Mark, know thyself.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.040]   You're drained, be polite."
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.920]   You know, it was my insecurity of just saying,
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.520]   you know, "I really appreciate you wanting to drive me back,
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.480]   but, you know, I really have a lot to do tomorrow.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.640]   I need to rest my voice.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.880]   I need to, you know, do some prep."
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.280]   Instead, I just sat there like, you know,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.680]   shaking and like, you know, having like, just went crazy.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.640]   So do you see what I'm getting at?
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   Like, really knowing yourself in terms of like,
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   what drives you and what your, you know,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.560]   your personality traits, just introversion,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.480]   extroversion alone, and how that relates to like,
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   your selection of strategies is so important.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.520]   - Super important.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.720]   And by the way, my joke about driving
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.800]   on the wrong side of the road,
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.120]   I do realize that we drive on the wrong side of the road
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.800]   for Australians and those in the UK.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.480]   So I'll do the touche for you.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.880]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.160]   to thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.600]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.760]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.960]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.640]   and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.800]   Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.760]   about the critical importance of hydration
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.940]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.680]   Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.600]   can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.920]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.640]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.200]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.600]   are critical for the functioning
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.800]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.760]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.200]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.840]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.280]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.200]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.360]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.960]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.680]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.860]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.840]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.960]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.160]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.880]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,

[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:44.960]   Text messaging is an interesting example of communication
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.320]   that nowadays, depending on how many people
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.360]   have access to your phone number,
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.980]   can either feel like a wonderful source
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.800]   of filling the gaps on trains and while in transit
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.360]   and while walking to the car,
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.880]   perhaps hopefully not while driving,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.920]   although people seem to do that.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.240]   And yet for the introvert,
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.120]   I can imagine that it might feel inundating.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.280]   It might feel kind of overwhelming.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.140]   How do you feel about text messages?
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.740]   Because it's just yet another form of communication.
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.240]   I ask this for a very particular reason.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.360]   I could imagine that extroverts love to text message.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.200]   They love to receive and send text messages,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.320]   that they can't stand a moment of downtime
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.480]   before boarding a plane.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.240]   They're excited that there's yet another form
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.920]   of communication at all hours of the day and night,
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.940]   whereas introverts would be less excited to text message.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.600]   I also ask this in part because I want to protect
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.680]   the variable latency to respond to text option
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.000]   that I've tried to exercise in my life,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.360]   but that seems to, doesn't really seem to work.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.920]   I think most people assume,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.960]   if I walk up to you and I say hello
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.180]   and you wait 10 minutes to say hello back,
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.600]   I'll first think you're a little bit rude
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.360]   and then think you're a little strange.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.880]   Whereas if I text you hello
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.820]   and I don't hear back right away,
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.000]   I might think you're busy.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.680]   There's some wiggle room for interpretation,
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.040]   but I think what I'm really getting at here
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.000]   is do we tend to project the same latency expectation
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.200]   on texts that we ourselves embrace?
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.840]   This seems like an important source
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.920]   of potential miscommunication,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.720]   misunderstanding, and maybe worse.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.360]   - Yeah, I mean, certainly.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.560]   You could imagine also, though,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.760]   that the introvert might be more comfortable texting
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.160]   because it's less stimulation.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.000]   So it could work.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I think it could work in both directions.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.960]   I think the problem with text messaging
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.600]   is that it's decreasing emotional intelligence
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.360]   because you really can't communicate the same way
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.520]   through a text message.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.440]   - Thank you.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.960]   - Can you repeat both those things again?
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.000]   - Yes, I'm happy to say it 100 times.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.820]   - No, because I mean, I feel this wash of like relief
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.120]   and now I'm looking for the appropriate word
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.960]   'cause I'm talking to you.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.960]   So I feel like I have to use the exact appropriate word.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.480]   I feel emancipated.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.400]   - There you go.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.520]   - Because I also feel that
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.120]   as texting has become more routine
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.000]   and has crossed a number of different lines
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   of formality and informality, right?
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.360]   Not just with family members,
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.840]   but with coworkers and people we do and don't know
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.040]   and just met and have known for ages.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.760]   You know, the jargon that we use with one group
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.280]   is different than the jargon we use with another.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.360]   But I feel that texting in general
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.000]   has really degraded our ability to communicate verbally
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.200]   and in writing elsewhere.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.920]   - There's good research on even like teens right now
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.760]   prefer to text than to be face-to-face.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.600]   - That's so weird.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.740]   - It's not helpful to building like good relationships.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.840]   - Forgive me, I'm gonna interrupt you too.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:00.800]   I have no idea what it's like to be a teenager in 2024.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.180]   So I've caught myself.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.120]   I have no place saying weird
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.980]   because there were things that I was doing as a teenager
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.560]   that I'm sure adults were like, that's weird.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.040]   So I take that back.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.320]   - But if you think about how disconnected and alienated
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.360]   and lonely people feel these days,
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.880]   that's not necessarily gonna help make things better.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.880]   I have an example.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.680]   You know, when my father passed away a number of years ago,
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.520]   I got all these text messages.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.640]   I'm so sorry for your loss.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.840]   I'm so sorry for your loss.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:28.660]   I'm so sorry.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.120]   From people who I thought were really good friends of mine,
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.500]   like 20, 30 year friends.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.880]   I'm like, you're not gonna pick up the phone
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.760]   and like listen to my voice and ask me,
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.360]   like what can I do to support you right now?
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.160]   And it's so strange.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.960]   And actually one of my closest friends, you know,
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:46.960]   didn't even text me.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.460]   She texted my assistant.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.780]   And said, please go into Mark's office
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.980]   and tell him that I love him.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.140]   I'm like, this is really weird.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.820]   Like we need to like, I picked up the phone.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.940]   I'm like, what is happening right now?
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.580]   What is happening right now?
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.980]   And you know, people have preconceived notions.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.380]   Maybe she thought I was overwhelmed
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.540]   and devastated and needed space.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.860]   But at the same time, like make a phone call,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.900]   leave me a voice message and give me, you know, some options.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.580]   I had one friend, she's like,
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.740]   Mark, I know you're going through a lot right now.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.740]   I just want you to know, like, if you wanna talk,
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.860]   anytime you wanna call me, call me.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.860]   If you wanna text, text.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.620]   If you want me to come out and stay with you
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.420]   for a couple of days, I'm there.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.380]   - That's an awesome friend.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.020]   - Yeah, that was like,
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.900]   that was exactly what I needed to hear.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:37.380]   I wanted, you know, someone to offer,
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.180]   provide options or just do.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.300]   But we're so hesitant these days.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.780]   It's kind of scary to me.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.940]   And it makes me fearful about the future
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:51.060]   of our relationships in general.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.500]   - Yeah, I think this is such an important topic.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:59.100]   I think because texting is so common
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.100]   and has been used to, you know,
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.900]   communicate so many different forms of human emotion
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.220]   in this broad bin format.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.940]   I mean, how much can you really put into a text?
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.780]   I have some friends and co-workers who put,
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.060]   and you can voice text.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.540]   - Which is like, then it's like.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.380]   - Right, right.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.580]   It's long and sometimes,
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.780]   well, there are issues with that too.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.740]   I feel like it's enriched compared to texting
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:26.700]   unless the text is carefully written out, punctuated.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.420]   I mean, we can see the care that people put
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.060]   into certain texts or emails that they tip,
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.740]   and most people, including myself, don't, right?
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.460]   Texting is a short form communication.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.420]   Audio notes, voice memos seem like a step up.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.180]   I think what this has probably done
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.900]   is that it's made the phone call
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.980]   or the, goodness, the handwritten card or letter,
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.940]   it's kind of raised that
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.900]   to the pinnacle of care of expression.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.820]   - Completely.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.940]   And by the way, text messaging, you know, it's fine.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.020]   I always, you know, I'll be home in a little while,
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.740]   you know, like, can you please pick this up?
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.140]   Whatever, great.
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.220]   There's nothing wrong with text messaging,
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.660]   but when it replaces intimacy
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.340]   and when it replaces building, you know, strong bonds,
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:12.100]   that's where I see the largest problem.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.460]   - Yeah, I didn't outright set this rule in my relationships,
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:17.900]   but I would say with my coworkers, family members,
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.820]   and in other kinds of relationships, there's a rule,
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.380]   which is that we don't argue over text.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.220]   - Yeah, it's not cool.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.900]   - But people do it a lot.
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.220]   - It's easier 'cause you don't have to feel the feelings.
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.940]   That's what it is.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.540]   You know, it's, I can be psychologically distant
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.900]   from that person and say what I wanna say,
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.660]   where if I have to say it face-to-face,
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.260]   I'm gonna have to face a response,
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.820]   and that response may be very uncomfortable for me,
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.700]   and I probably don't have the strategies to deal with it
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.540]   'cause I never learned them.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.100]   - I mean, you and I are both aware
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:51.580]   that there is neural real estate
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:55.380]   specifically dedicated to the processing of faces
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.300]   and specifically to the processing of human faces
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.620]   and specifically to the processing of the emotions
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:04.300]   carried in human facial expressions.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:09.100]   So, you know, this is a hardwired aspect to our species.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.300]   - Which is diminishing.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.100]   You know, there was a good study done about kids in camps,
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.660]   and they randomly assigned them to be with their phones,
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.500]   not with their phones,
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.980]   and showed that after a couple of weeks of camp,
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.380]   kids who had their phones decreased
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.660]   in their emotion perception skills.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.980]   So, it makes a difference.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.420]   You know, we need to give children and adults
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.020]   more face-to-face time.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.820]   - Wild.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.740]   - Talk about the energy pleasantness axes.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.580]   - Sure.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.820]   - And create a mental picture for people of what this is.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.980]   I found this to be incredibly useful.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.900]   If listeners or viewers have a pen or pencil and paper,
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.420]   you could map this out,
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.500]   but it's very easy to imagine in your mind.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.180]   So, maybe you could just tell us on the vertical axis.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.220]   - Yeah, so we have, you know,
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.500]   horizontal, we'll call that pleasantness.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.300]   And this is going back to something else
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.740]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.900]   It's called pleasantness, not goodness or badness.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.420]   It's, in this moment, am I feeling highly pleasant,
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.780]   or am I feeling unpleasant?
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.900]   Do I feel like approaching my day, my colleagues?
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.060]   Do I feel like avoiding my colleagues?
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.620]   Do I feel safe and comfortable?
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.380]   Do I feel uncomfortable?
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.580]   That's the x-axis.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.220]   And the way I like to think about it
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.420]   is that from the moment we wake up in the morning
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.500]   till the time we go to bed, that is activated.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.380]   We're just, you know, you wake up in the morning
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.460]   and you're all of a sudden have a thought process,
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.060]   like, yes, I want to get out of bed.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.540]   No, I want to pull the covers over my head.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.420]   On the y-axis is energy or activation.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.460]   - Okay, so vertical axis is energy.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.940]   - The technical term is arousal or activation,
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.460]   but I think energy is a better term.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.460]   And so, it's either you're highly energized
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.300]   or you're deactivated or low in energy.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.940]   That's mental energy, it's physical energy.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.580]   It's like kind of like how much fuel you have.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.860]   And then we cross those two axes
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.300]   to create what we call in our work, the mood meter.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.500]   And there are four quadrants.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.140]   We got high pleasant, high energy, yellow.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.620]   So think about emotions there.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.140]   Happy, excited, elated, ecstatic, optimistic.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:26.220]   We got the green, so that's low energy and pleasant still.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.580]   That's the calm, content,
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.340]   tranquil, peaceful, relaxed quadrant.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.340]   And then we have the unpleasant side.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.020]   And I'm gonna repeat myself.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.140]   It's not the bad emotions or the negative emotions.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.700]   We're gonna call them unpleasant
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.680]   'cause it's not generally pleasant to be sad
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.660]   or down or disappointed or hopeless or feeling despair,
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.740]   which is the blue or that low energy unpleasant.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.020]   And then we got our red quadrant on the mood meter,
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.420]   which we'll call the high energy, highly unpleasant emotions
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.200]   which are feelings of anger and anxiety.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.460]   So it's very helpful for people
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.460]   because when you're, like you even said this yourself,
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.320]   you're not really sure how you're feeling.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.780]   And we know our inner lives are complex.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.020]   So to be able to have a tool that has four quadrants
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.260]   where you're like, I don't know, am I pleasant?
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.520]   I guess I'm kind of pleasant, but my energy is low.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.800]   All right, I'm in the green.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.820]   All right, now what are my options there?
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.660]   No, I'm feeling quite energized and pleasant.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.620]   Oh, what are my options there, et cetera?
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:31.020]   We find that for both preschoolers and CEOs,
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.900]   very helpful, extraordinarily helpful.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.720]   And then going back to RULER for a minute,
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.780]   we might talk about the quadrant
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.260]   as being the R for self-awareness, right?
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.180]   Recognizing like, where am I in emotion space?
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.140]   And then you might ask yourself like,
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.820]   all right, well, what's going on?
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.740]   Why am I thinking that I'm in the yellow
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.260]   or red or blue or green?
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.900]   What just happened?
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.780]   What might be happening?
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.580]   Oh, I'm about to be on a podcast.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.540]   Oh, I'm about to take a test.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.180]   Oh, I'm about to go into a difficult meeting
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.020]   with a colleague.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.820]   Oh, I'm about to go home and my partner's gonna be mad.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:12.180]   Okay, now I understand why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.740]   I put a word to it, I'm more precise.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.780]   I'm not enraged, I'm irritable.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.180]   I'm not blissful, I'm just content.
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.580]   I'm not depressed, I'm just feeling down.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.260]   I'm not overwhelmed, I'm just feeling a little uneasy.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.540]   That's helpful because that helps you
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.660]   go into the E and the R of ruler, which is,
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.700]   all right, is this an emotion I need to express
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.780]   or do I keep it to myself?
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.060]   Does this emotion need help?
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.860]   Do I need support right now?
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.140]   Or am I okay with what I'm feeling?
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.420]   I have a great story about this actually.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.820]   You know, we're born to be fixers, I think.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.620]   You know, especially in my role, like as a teacher
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.420]   or if you're a parent, you know, with a kid
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.540]   or a teacher, partners, right?
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.060]   And so I go to visit this school where my program is.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.420]   It's called Ruler also.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.100]   And we're in about 5,000 schools now
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.900]   across the United States.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.300]   And I'm visiting this school, kindergarten.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.100]   And I do this check-in and the little boy says
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.340]   he's in the blue, which means unpleasant, low in energy.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.740]   And of course, my little five-year-old,
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.380]   he's in the blue, I feel terrible.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.620]   And then my fixer, like I wanna fix this kid,
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.820]   I don't want this kid to be in the blue.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.500]   And so I know I can't do that 'cause it's part of the,
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.620]   it's like the rules of Ruler.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.900]   You don't fix people's feelings.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.140]   You don't fix people's feelings.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   So I just said to the boy, I'm just curious, you know,
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.340]   you need a strategy?
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.180]   And he goes, no.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:39.460]   And I'm like, no, I'm just curious, you know,
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.300]   why don't you need a strategy?
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.020]   He goes, 'cause I know it's impermanent.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.380]   - Wow.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.740]   Maybe the next generations coming up
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.500]   are far more emotionally intelligent than ours, if I may.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.220]   - If they are, if they get direct instruction,
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.900]   that's my vision for the world
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.260]   is that everyone gets an emotion education.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.700]   And the boy says, no, you know, I know it's gonna go away.
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.780]   I'm fine.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.500]   I'm like, okay, I'm just bad to this kid.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.780]   Like, you're my teacher.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.180]   You know, it was amazing.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.660]   And to think that that five-year-old had that insight,
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.220]   that he had an unpleasant feeling
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.700]   that didn't need to be fixed, that it was okay,
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.460]   that he just knew he was in a little flunking,
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.140]   but he has already experienced that emotions are ephemeral,
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.540]   you know, and he can just let it go
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.700]   and he'll be in the green a little later
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.700]   or the red or whatever else.
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.100]   It was really kind of mind-blowing.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.980]   - I was going to ask,
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.600]   how do we resolve the contradiction
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.460]   between the message to feel our feelings
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.460]   versus to just recognize that the feelings
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:44.060]   are moving through us as this five-year-old, gosh,
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.460]   was and is able to do.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.140]   Because I feel like it gets to the heart
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.720]   of a lot of what we hear
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.260]   in the psychological and wellness space,
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.740]   which is, you know, feelings are just feelings.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:55.580]   They're transient.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.580]   They represent all sorts of things.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.380]   And we can get to the biological underpinnings
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:03.980]   or the, you know, childhood trauma root cause underpinnings,
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.140]   all sorts of things, genetics for that matter.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:11.180]   Should we feel our feelings in order to best recognize them?
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.860]   I would imagine, yes.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.660]   Is there any value to suppressing our feelings
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.740]   or does that tend to just grow the feeling?
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:21.780]   What is known about this from the research literature?
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.380]   Because you see a lot of different opinions about this,
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.300]   but I'd like to know,
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.460]   have there been any experiments
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.900]   where people are placed into a negative or positive emotion
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.660]   or are experiencing a negative or positive emotion
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.740]   and then intentionally try to suppress it?
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.300]   Has there been any brain imaging?
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.140]   - Yeah, there is.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.460]   - Measurement of galvanic skin response?
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.420]   Like, does the emotion grow
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.020]   or does the emotion shrink?
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.860]   - It tends to grow.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:49.500]   There are cultural differences, just to be frank.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.140]   But in, you know, Western culture,
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.660]   suppression tends not to have great outcomes.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:59.540]   Finding ways to reappraise tends to be more helpful.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:03.300]   This really gets into, though, for me, the core of my work.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.700]   Because, you know, for 20 years of my life,
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.820]   I was running a center for emotional intelligence
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.540]   and teaching skills.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.060]   And I would go around and I would see a lot of resistance,
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.180]   a lot of resistance.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.820]   Whether it was, you know, the hedge fund manager
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.660]   or the superintendent of schools or a parent.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.220]   You know, I've had fathers come up to me,
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.540]   say things like, you know, Mark, you're so vulnerable.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.780]   Like, you shared your whole story about being bullied.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.780]   Like, I would never, in my wildest dream,
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.060]   ever share with my own son that I was bullied as a kid.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.900]   And I'm like, tell me more, of course.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.220]   You know, I'm a psychologist.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.780]   And in the end, you know, what, you know,
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:42.660]   the guy was afraid that his son would think he was weak.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.660]   And so we have a mindset about feelings
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.020]   that we have to talk about.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.580]   People have feelings about their feelings.
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.020]   Sometimes we call those meta-emotions or meta-feelings.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.500]   Sometimes it's just that happy is good,
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.260]   anger is bad, that simple.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.660]   My whole recent research has focused on
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.460]   something I call permission to feel.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.300]   You know, you know a little bit about my own story.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.900]   I had a pretty rough childhood that included abuse.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.060]   It included a lot of bullying.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.340]   And I had two parents who loved me.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.460]   But, you know, my mother was a very anxious woman
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.180]   who never had strategies.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.900]   So, you know, she was always saying,
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.180]   I'm having a nervous breakdown.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.580]   And she'd lock herself in her room
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.460]   and she wouldn't come out for a few hours.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.820]   My father was, as we might call today, you know,
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:32.740]   the tough guy who was kind of toxically masculine.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.500]   So I need to go toughen up.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.220]   He even said to me once, you know,
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.780]   he's gone now and we have a good,
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.020]   we had a good relationship, but I'll never forget.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.660]   He said, you know, son, I used to beat kids up like you.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.500]   - He said that?
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.060]   - He did.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.340]   And he didn't, I mean, he thought that was a message
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.500]   that I needed to hear to toughen up.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.700]   Right, that was, he was doing that through love.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.700]   I mean, it was not emotionally intelligent parenting.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.940]   But that's, that was the way he thought.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.420]   And, you know, he did love me.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.980]   He just didn't know how to be a parent in that way.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.780]   And so think about that.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:09.260]   Bullied, shame, fear, abused,
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.300]   all kinds of stuff going on in my head.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.380]   Mom having nervous breakdowns, father toughen up.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.020]   What happens?
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.660]   You suppress, you deny, you ignore, you eat.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.860]   You do all kinds of weird behaviors
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:26.340]   because you have nowhere to go with your feelings.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.980]   And I fear that way too many people
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.700]   feel that way right now.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.260]   And I have good research to show that.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.980]   You know, you've read my book,
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.900]   you know I had an Uncle Marvin.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.020]   He was a middle school teacher who, you know,
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.260]   by some wave of a magic wand
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.420]   was staying with my family one summer when I was 12.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.540]   And he noticed something in my facial expression,
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:51.620]   my body language, he knew something was off.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.780]   And he was the first adult who sat with me and said,
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.220]   "Hey Mark, how are you feeling?"
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:01.780]   And I don't know if it was his facial expression,
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:03.420]   his body language, his vocal tone,
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.340]   but that was the opener for me.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.940]   I'm not doing so well.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.980]   I don't really like life very much.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.580]   I'm scared.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.780]   And he didn't say I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.660]   or toughen up.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.940]   He said, "We're gonna get through this.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.580]   "I gotcha, I'm with you."
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:24.620]   And it's really interesting to me because, you know,
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.060]   I feel like we're so focused on skill building,
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.100]   which is really important.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.220]   But I wanna take a step back and say,
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.500]   are we giving ourselves, are we giving our colleagues,
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.620]   our partners, our children, the permission to feel?
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:43.140]   And I feel like a lot of people don't have that permission.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.020]   Now, my research shows with tens of thousands of people
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:50.620]   across cultures, that only about a third of adults
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.660]   felt that they had someone when they were young
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.100]   who created the conditions for them
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.420]   to have permission to feel.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.780]   I mean, 70% of the people walking around here right now
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.780]   in our corporations, in our schools, in our homes,
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.740]   30% felt like they had that.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.020]   And then you wonder,
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.500]   what do you think the characteristics are of these people?
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.900]   The characteristics of the Uncle Marvin's or Aunt Maria's
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.780]   or the colleague at work, by the way.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:19.620]   This also works in the adult workforce.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:24.620]   You can have an emotion mentor or a feelings coach at work.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.740]   There's three characteristics.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.100]   Do you wanna take a guess?
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.820]   - I'm guessing empathically attuned.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.860]   - Okay.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.060]   - Although that's a, for those that know,
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.300]   empathy involves a bunch of subcategories.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.540]   So I wanna acknowledge that.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:41.760]   Empathically attuned.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.740]   I'm guessing that they have themselves
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.580]   some high emotional intelligence.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.780]   And the third is,
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:56.940]   gosh, my hope is that there be a high situational awareness.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.580]   - Yeah.
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:03.580]   - Right, because your uncle needed to see something subtle
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.100]   in your facial expression, or maybe not so subtle,
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.060]   but everyone else was missing it.
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.220]   But to be able to detect that there was something
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.180]   that really need, it was like a silent cry for help.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.500]   - Yeah.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.540]   You're getting it, like you're really nuanced,
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:21.300]   which is, that's why you're a scientist too.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.980]   The three broad characteristics,
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.020]   the first one that shows up cross-culturally,
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.980]   nonjudgmental.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.820]   Like when we think about the people
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.820]   who gave us permission to feel,
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.340]   they just had no judgment.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.540]   They let me be who I can be, or who I am.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.780]   The second is empathic,
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.740]   and kind of coupled with compassionate,
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:45.100]   which is kind of a different form of empathy.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.760]   The third, primarily, is active listening.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.860]   People wanna be around people who don't judge them,
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.700]   who listen actively, and show that they care.
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.540]   It's that simple.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.340]   And I'll tell you, it's really interesting to me,
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.940]   because I do a lot of public speaking,
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.000]   and often my new strategy is I do surveys
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.260]   where I'm gonna be presenting,
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.300]   so I can present the audience themselves with their data.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:14.620]   And so I'm giving this speech to a bunch of adult parents,
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.380]   high school parents.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.060]   And I'm showing the data from them.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.220]   They filled out the survey.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.080]   Nonjudgmental, active listening, empathy, compassion.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.060]   And I show, just like my national study,
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.260]   a third of you said yes, two-thirds of you said no.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:36.060]   So this mom, and she just impulsively jumps out of her seat.
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.700]   She's like, "I'm having an epiphany."
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.100]   I'm like, "Okay."
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.320]   And she's like, "I know.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.080]   "I'm certain that my daughter has an Uncle Marvin.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:45.980]   "I know it.
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.960]   "And I'm also certain that my son doesn't.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.920]   "And you know something, Mark?
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.620]   "I am leaving your presentation today,
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.880]   "and I am finding my son, his Uncle Marvin."
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.460]   And I'm like, "Lady, it could be you."
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.300]   And it was like--
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.580]   - Right, so interesting, it's kind of going right by her.
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.940]   - It's like outsourcing.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:03.780]   - Right.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.600]   - Like there's your karate teacher,
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.900]   there's your feelings mentor.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.740]   And it's interesting to me,
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:11.340]   and I push on this in my research now,
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.420]   what is the resistance?
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.580]   Like what are people so afraid of?
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.900]   I mean, they're so afraid of feelings,
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.400]   their own and their children's or their partner's.
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.620]   And so I ask, you know, I push on this.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.940]   And what's really interesting and sad to me
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.620]   is that adults today, the two barriers,
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.700]   I'm gonna now I'm gonna push you again.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.900]   What do you think the two things that get in the way
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.120]   of giving other people permission to feel?
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.900]   - This is actually where my next question was going.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.540]   So I'll just ask the question in the form of an answer.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]   Is this like Jeopardy?
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.540]   I guess that's what you do.
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:49.980]   No, it's the other way around at Jeopardy.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.800]   Sorry, you can see how many episodes of Jeopardy
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.640]   I've watched.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:59.780]   That if people don't have adequate emotional boundaries
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:05.000]   and they are maybe even too empathically attuned,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.260]   that someone they care about experiencing anger
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:13.460]   or sadness or frustration, maybe even with them,
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.460]   would shift their own emotions
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.060]   and not make them able to be available
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.660]   with the three qualities that you listed off before,
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.460]   in particular, non-judgment.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.820]   Because now it's personal.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.180]   And so it would undermine the process.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.520]   - You're right there.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.900]   The first one though,
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.780]   is just a really interesting one, just time.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.500]   People, I don't have the time.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.240]   You don't have the time to be non-judgmental?
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.860]   Like, can you talk to me about that one, please?
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.700]   - It's actually the case
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.660]   that we don't have the time to be judgmental.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.140]   It's far too energetically costly.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.400]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.320]   The second really goes back to the skills.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.120]   So I've had parents say things like,
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.380]   I'm afraid to ask my child how they're feeling
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.480]   'cause I'm not gonna be able to handle it.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.600]   I mean, think about that for a minute.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.840]   I'm not gonna be able to handle it.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.800]   So you'd rather your son or daughter
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.720]   suppress their fears or whatever they're feeling
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.360]   because you haven't developed the skills
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:13.640]   that you need to help co-regulate and support them.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.440]   You know, this is again, going back to my mission, vision,
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.760]   is that we need a world
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.960]   where everyone gets an emotion education.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.720]   Preschool to high school,
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.320]   and it's gotta continue in college,
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.880]   and it's gotta continue in the workforce,
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.160]   and it's gotta continue as we grow older
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.160]   because as a 54-year-old person right now
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.840]   who leads a large group of people, COVID hits.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.440]   I had a complete meltdown.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.400]   I didn't know how to lead during COVID.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.760]   I was trying to figure it out.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.640]   I was doing Zoom meetings and crazy stuff,
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.760]   and then my mother-in-law got stuck with me,
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.640]   and that was a real kind of wake-up call
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.600]   in terms of like relationship building.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.720]   I mean, it was really rough for me, actually.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.800]   She came for a wedding.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.040]   One of my colleagues got married on March 3rd of 2020.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.400]   Well, my mother-in-law is from Panama,
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.840]   and so just so you know,
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.080]   all flights to Panama got canceled by March 13th,
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.440]   and they didn't open until September.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.360]   So we had this 81-year-old lovely, lovely woman,
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   but like, you know, it's a lot
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.880]   for your mother-in-law to live with you for eight months.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.320]   One little quick side story for this.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.920]   I just, I think it's relevant.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.200]   So like, it was getting really, you know,
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.640]   I'm working from home.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.560]   My mother-in-law was there.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.560]   She wants me to make her a cappuccino every morning,
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.920]   which I like to do for the first week,
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.160]   but like after the fourth month,
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.320]   like learn how to use the machine,
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.600]   and I don't want to do it myself.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.520]   I'm afraid of the machine.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.560]   I'm like-
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.000]   - Sorry, I'm not, I didn't mean to laugh out loud.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:38.840]   - That's all right.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.160]   - Yeah, those cappuccino machines can be scary.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.080]   - They can be, but like growth mindset, right?
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.920]   Like watch me, I'll help you do it.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.240]   No, I want you to make the coffee.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.200]   I'm like, you gotta make your own coffee.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.320]   You got, like, I told you,
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.600]   I don't like people in the morning.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.240]   You gotta make your own coffee.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.000]   Anyhow, one night we're at dinner,
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.480]   and she looks at me, and she speaks Spanish.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.400]   I speak Spanish.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.440]   And so she said, you know, in Spanish,
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.960]   are you really the director of the Center
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.280]   for Emotional Intelligence?
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.680]   And I looked at her and I'm like, not tonight, not tonight.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.920]   Like it's, we're going down, and it was a mess.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.520]   Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.080]   I laughed before you said it was a mess.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.640]   I just, your impression of the question.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.400]   It's a, maybe it drew to mind some experiences of mine.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.200]   - Yeah, I mean, and there it was.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.880]   Like, yes, my day job is I run a Center
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.360]   for Emotional Intelligence, but like I'm a human being
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:33.200]   who had strong emotions and I didn't have the strategies.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.640]   And I needed to cultivate a whole new set
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.320]   of regulation strategies to deal
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.640]   with that new aspect of my life.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.540]   - In thinking about people that can really help us
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:46.360]   by asking us the right questions,
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.000]   or in thinking about how we can ask people
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.200]   the right questions to really help them
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.500]   and us gain an understanding of what they're experiencing.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.800]   I'm recalling numerous instances in my life
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.920]   where there seemed to be the requirement
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:05.160]   for an excuse, like an activity excuse.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.200]   I currently have a very good relationship with my father,
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.780]   but I remember when there was a time
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.680]   where we had to talk about science or watches
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.960]   as an entry point to any conversation,
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.920]   let alone about emotions, right?
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.180]   And he's done a lot of work.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.020]   I've done a lot of work.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:21.960]   And I like to think we're much,
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.760]   we are much further down the road.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.680]   We enjoy a very close relationship
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.040]   as a consequence of that work in part.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   But I think what you're describing really makes me realize
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:38.140]   that no matter who anybody is or what their age
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:41.700]   or what their background, that as human beings,
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.000]   we don't just need permission,
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.560]   but we really should think about just having a conversation
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.200]   about how others feel.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.040]   - 100%.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.560]   - As opposed to making an activity a prerequisite
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.200]   for that conversation.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.640]   And as I say this,
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.320]   I realize some people are probably thinking,
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.820]   oh boy, okay, so we're just going to sit around
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.200]   and talk about our feelings.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.020]   But my short response to that is yes,
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.280]   because when you don't do that,
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.780]   then I can say from experience,
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.660]   then pretty soon you're not participating
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.340]   in those activities with that person.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.020]   And potentially with anybody, you know, I mean,
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.580]   I'm not saying that people become so unpleasant
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:22.260]   to themselves and others that they don't have any friends.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.420]   I mean, okay, that's an extreme case.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.180]   But what I hear in the backdrop of everything you're saying
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.740]   is that it's not just about an education.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:35.160]   It's really about a practice of giving ourselves
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.180]   and others permission to simply have a conversation
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.860]   about what one is feeling as an exercise for both people
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:44.520]   to be able to explore that in the correct way.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.140]   And there is a correct way.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.420]   And you've described the ruler approach as one.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.020]   - Yeah, there are strategies.
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.060]   Correctness is a tricky term.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.540]   You know, it's a game.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.140]   It's no matter what, it's going to be a game
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.780]   because you can't predict how people will respond.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.540]   But I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.620]   I'll give you another example.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.160]   My father, who like you,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.000]   we ended up having an excellent relationship.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.080]   My mom died when I was young and he remarried
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.240]   and he had moved to upstate New York
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.040]   and he had this lovely wife.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.840]   And she called me about two years after they were married.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.520]   And she's like, "Mark, I can't take it anymore.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.800]   "Your father is driving me out of my mind."
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.640]   I'm like, "What do you mean?
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.940]   "He's angry all the time.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.600]   "He's just really making me miserable."
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.280]   And she's like, "I think, you know,
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.560]   "I might have to leave him."
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.840]   And I'm thinking to myself,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.740]   oh my goodness, like, you know,
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.200]   he's older and if she leaves him,
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.320]   he's going to want to move in with me.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.120]   So like, road trip.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.960]   And so I went on a road trip,
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.280]   took my father out to the local coffee shop.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.440]   We're sitting down.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.000]   I can't take it anymore.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.840]   This is what he's telling me.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.600]   I can't take it anymore.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.360]   I'm like, "Dad, like, tell me more."
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.320]   I can't take it anymore.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.280]   I'm like, "That's not enough information, Dad.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.720]   "Like, what can't you take anymore?"
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.440]   In the end, what I learned was that
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.120]   my father has three sons.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.560]   All of us have doctorates.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.640]   We're all independent.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.120]   We're all successful.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.280]   Her children were having struggles
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.880]   and she was needing to babysit her grandchildren.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.200]   My father didn't like that.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.520]   My sons are all taking care of themselves.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.160]   You know, I want, you know,
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.920]   he's not realizing this, but what he's saying is,
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.400]   "I don't like the idea of you spending so much time
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.000]   "with these grandkids 'cause I want your attention."
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.360]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.760]   'Cause after my father and I spoke
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.680]   for about a half hour about this,
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.280]   I said, "Dad, you know, it sounds like you're jealous."
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.880]   He's like, "What do you mean I'm jealous?"
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.800]   I said, "Well, you're upset that Jane, your wife,
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.080]   "wants to spend more time with the grandkids
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.880]   "and that's not time with you."
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.240]   In my emotion lexicon, I didn't use that term,
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.680]   you know, that's jealousy.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.040]   I can't believe you're telling me I'm jealous.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.320]   I'm like, "I'm not telling you you're jealous.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.320]   "You're telling me you're jealous.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.800]   "I'm just giving you the concept."
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.840]   He starts crying, hysterical crying,
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.640]   'cause he had awareness for the first time
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.840]   of his emotional experience.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.120]   He was so emotionally illiterate.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.920]   He just didn't know what he was feeling
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.480]   and he was just acting out.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.600]   Once he sat down and understood the experience
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.640]   of like wife wants to be with child
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.440]   'cause they need support, I'm not happy with that
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.600]   'cause I don't know what to do with myself
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.520]   when she's spending time with the grandkids.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.400]   It's jealousy.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.800]   All of a sudden, we had a pathway to helping him regulate.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.920]   Now, I'll finish this story by saying
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.120]   about two months later, Jane, she calls me.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.520]   She's like, "Mark, I don't know what you did
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.680]   "at that coffee shop, but like your father's a changed man."
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:46.000]   And you know, I don't take all the credit,
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.400]   take some credit, but it just shows you the power
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.120]   of emotional self-awareness.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.520]   Like once you really know how you're feeling,
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.880]   it can be liberating and then you can figure out
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.960]   what you need to do with those feelings.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.240]   - I'm letting that really sink in
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.780]   because I think these days we hear a lot about therapy.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:08.600]   Fortunately, in my opinion, I think,
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.360]   and I'm gonna get the numbers only crudely right,
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.440]   but they're certainly in the right direction and amplitude.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.080]   There was a survey done, I believe at Stanford,
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.760]   asking students how willing they would be to seek therapy
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:25.120]   if they were dealing with an emotionally trying time.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.520]   And this was in the, I think, early and mid 90s.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.160]   And the numbers that came back were very low,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.340]   somewhere in the teens or 20% of students polled.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.680]   Whereas nowadays it's in excess of 80 or 90%.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.720]   - It's very high. - Yeah.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.680]   And I think that's representative of a lot of-
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.480]   - Can I give you another example of this?
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.840]   So here I am, a professor at Yale,
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.320]   teaching courses on emotional intelligence.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.080]   Now I should just let you know there's resistance oftentimes
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.480]   and my students are fantastic in general,
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.620]   but there's a resistance to wanting to learn
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:57.840]   about emotional intelligence.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.080]   What they want to do in general is get an A in my course,
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.800]   but they don't, and they want to memorize like,
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.600]   oh, so the theory was written in 1990 by Mayer and Salovey.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.960]   - This is a pre-med course?
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.400]   - No, this is just general undergrad.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.600]   - That was a joke against pre-meds.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.760]   Love the pre-meds, but they are very grade conscious.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.880]   - I have stories about that too.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.160]   But, and so I say, no,
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.360]   this is about you developing the skills.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.180]   Like this is gonna be,
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:23.760]   you're gonna think really critically about,
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.260]   and part of the essays you're gonna write
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.640]   are gonna be your action plans
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.920]   for building your own emotional intelligence.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.760]   I don't want to do that.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.980]   I want to, you know, get the test and take it,
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.680]   you know, get the A.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.380]   After a month, I get them bought in.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:40.360]   Interestingly though,
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.560]   and my, 'cause I make my courses into research
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.800]   and I ask them to fill out surveys,
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.320]   how they're feeling, every class.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.420]   Number one emotion, stressed.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:51.720]   Everybody's stressed.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.520]   I'm thinking to myself, like stressed out,
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.920]   like you got a good life here,
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.900]   but nevertheless stressed, you know,
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.040]   I have to have empathy, I get it.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.580]   But I decided that I really had a hard time.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.860]   Remember, I defined stress as having too many demands
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:06.900]   and not enough resources.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.740]   I didn't feel like that was the actual feeling.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.220]   Now, who am I to judge?
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.720]   But one way to get better at it
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.080]   was to have my students do journaling.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.860]   When you're stressed, write about it.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.700]   What's on your mind?
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.200]   What are you thinking about?
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.680]   Take a guess what the number one emotion was
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.320]   after we did the qualitative analysis.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.760]   Of journaling about stress?
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.200]   Yeah, what they were really feeling.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.120]   Fear.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:32.960]   Okay.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.800]   Envy.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.960]   Oh, interesting.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.800]   Envy.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.680]   Envy.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.020]   Your father is richer than my father.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.520]   Your mother is more connected than my mother.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.680]   You've got better hips.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.200]   You've got better lips.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.720]   It was endless social comparisons, right?
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.920]   And so envy, right, is wanting what someone else has.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.680]   Anxiety is about uncertainty.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.840]   Stress is about too many demands, not enough resources.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.840]   And so here I was, you know, having deeper knowledge
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.360]   of what was the underlying feeling or emotion
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.440]   that they were having, which was envy, not stress.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.920]   And so I had a conversation with the counseling department
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.420]   and I made a joke about it and I was like, you know,
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.120]   what's our university's envy reduction program?
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.320]   You know, it wasn't, you know,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.160]   the most popular, you know, conversation.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.500]   And I just think it's interesting to think about it
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.740]   in terms of helping people to learn what to do
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.700]   with their emotions, you know.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.320]   Right now, you know, there's a mindfulness craze.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.740]   Everyone's doing mindfulness and I do mindfulness
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.600]   and I appreciate mindfulness.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.880]   But let me tell you, you know,
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.280]   when you're feeling chronic envy, you know,
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.360]   doing breathing exercises is not gonna decrease the envy.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.400]   You're gonna have to work on your construction
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.240]   in your mind of your relationships with people.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.400]   And so I just feel so strongly that we help people
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.640]   pause a little bit, reflect a little bit,
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.200]   think about how they're feeling
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.980]   as a pathway to just having wellbeing.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:06.320]   - Your joke about envy reduction
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.240]   is something I take very seriously.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.520]   We did a four episode series with Dr. Paul Conti,
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.960]   who's a world expert in, he's a psychiatrist
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.960]   and among the very, very best psychiatrists in the world
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.580]   by many accounts.
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:26.720]   And he discussed during that series,
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.560]   but also on other podcasts he's appeared in,
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.600]   such as my friend Lex Friedman's podcast,
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.360]   that envy is actually at the root
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.760]   of much of the evil in the world.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.620]   Small scale evil, large scale evil,
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.920]   and a lot of the despair that people feel.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.240]   And I think it's a word that isn't discussed enough
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:52.200]   because like the sound of it, it's kind of gross, right?
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.100]   Envious, envy, nobody wants to be associated with it.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.760]   But fortunately, Dr. Conti described it
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:03.100]   as a natural human emotion in some cases,
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.960]   but I had no idea.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.080]   And I don't know if he knows,
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.800]   but maybe he does through his clinical work,
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.160]   but I'll certainly pass along what you just said to him,
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:14.800]   that so much of the stress that I have to imagine
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.720]   good people and these students are after all,
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.160]   I imagine they're not evil.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.000]   - Very few.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.340]   - Not characterologically evil, let's hope,
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.920]   are experiencing envy.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.720]   The wish to have more of what somebody else has,
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.120]   maybe something specific,
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.480]   which of course gets to these more common phrases
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.880]   of people feeling that they are not enough.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.920]   - Yeah, which is going back to contentment.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.320]   - Right, actually, oh, I didn't draw the arrow.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.680]   Now I thought I drew the arrow.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.520]   Between contentment and envy, right?
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.040]   So if one wants to combat envy,
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.440]   you can imagine that a program to combat envy
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.000]   might be perceived, if one didn't understand it,
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.740]   as a calling for people to just be content with less,
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.640]   which is not what we want, right?
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.480]   I mean, we want ambitious people in the world.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.760]   We want people aspiring.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.800]   We want people to have growth mindset.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.640]   And yet we don't want people to be stressed
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.440]   and have a pervasive feeling of envy inside either.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.120]   So how would you make inroads into envy?
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.520]   - Well, I think, again, like all emotions,
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.960]   envy is not a bad emotion.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.600]   You know, the way I think about emotions as being,
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.880]   you know, when we need to get help with our emotions
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.240]   is when, if it's an unpleasant one,
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.760]   it's intense and long duration, right?
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.800]   Momentary envy, you know, I get envious all the time.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.360]   I get envious, I watched Ted Talks.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.560]   I'm like, "Oh, that timing was amazing."
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.040]   You know, and I'm like, "I'm gonna try that out."
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.360]   You know, so I use that envy of someone else's skill,
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.240]   you know, as a way to grow.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.080]   - How does that differ?
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.800]   Sorry to turn your own work back on you
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.880]   from admiration or inspiration.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.960]   Like, wow, they, you know, like the-
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.640]   - Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.680]   So that's the difference between, you know,
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.840]   the envy that leans toward admiration
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.280]   versus the envy, like what you're referring to,
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.840]   that leads to resentment, right?
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:13.840]   It's if I hate you because you have, you know, what I want.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:20.200]   Now we're talking, you know, pathological envy potentially.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.680]   And so that's the self-awareness piece.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.680]   You know, that's the part of really getting, you know,
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.480]   that differentiation of emotion, that granularity.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.200]   Because again, it's like anger, it's not a bad emotion.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.720]   Anger's okay, there's reasons to be angry in the world.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.160]   When we get treated unfairly, we should be angry.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.720]   Doesn't mean that we have to be dysregulated, right?
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.400]   There's an assumption that we make
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.160]   that when we experience unpleasant, strong emotions
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.880]   like anxiety or anger, you know,
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.800]   that we're gonna be dysregulated.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.920]   I have a whole new relationship with my anxiety.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.200]   Very different relationship.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.120]   I mean, I spent years working on it.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:00.880]   I notice it and I'm like, "Hi, anxiety,
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.200]   how are you doing today?"
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.640]   And then it just, it's okay.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:06.320]   I can even be giving, you know, here with you
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:10.000]   or giving a speech or teaching, have that anxiety come in
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.800]   and not allow it to have power over me
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:16.360]   because I can observe it, I can welcome it.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.800]   And then if it's in the way, I can say,
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.520]   "You know, anxiety, you're gonna go back there
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.360]   for a little while."
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.840]   Or, "You know, Mark, I mean, sometimes, you know,
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.040]   when I give speeches, like it's the same speech, right?
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.320]   You're like redundant."
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.480]   And it's like, "I can't believe
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.320]   I have to talk about this again."
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.760]   And then I'll look at the audience and I'm like,
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.600]   "It's their first time."
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.200]   You know, and it's like, all of a sudden,
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:37.640]   like my despair turns into optimism and hope.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:40.120]   That's all regulation.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:44.600]   - Conflict resolution is something that I think a lot about
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:48.560]   in any situation where emotions are discussed.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.040]   And it brings me back to this earlier situation
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.000]   you were talking about where this woman said
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.320]   that she was gonna find her child,
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:59.960]   somebody to help him to intervene.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.440]   And you were thinking, "Well, why not you?"
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.680]   - His feelings meant she was gonna go, you know,
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.240]   buy his feelings mentor.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.280]   - Right, exactly.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.280]   And now there's a whole field of feelings mentors
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.120]   cropping up.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.000]   That actually wouldn't be such a bad thing.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.600]   - Hey, that's another one of my goals, so.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.840]   - It wouldn't be such a bad thing.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.680]   - Say it louder.
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.520]   - I like that goal.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.720]   So when we were talking about that,
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.520]   one of the things that surfaced was this notion
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.280]   that some people have a natural empathic attunement
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:28.060]   or the emotion that the other person is feeling
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:32.000]   is a negative one and it's about us or about them.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.720]   And as a consequence, we're not able to really be present
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.840]   to help the person the way that you helped your dad.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.240]   Like he was frustrated with his wife.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.560]   Had he been frustrated with you,
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.520]   it might be a little bit more challenging to say,
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.000]   "Hey, well, dad, maybe what you're experiencing
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.880]   in terms of your frustration with me is actually blank."
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:54.720]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.040]   - Because you're now in a tether with them.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.040]   So to what extent is empathic attunement a positive trait?
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.240]   Are there people who are better at turning it off
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.460]   or directing it in appropriate ways than others?
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:12.320]   In a previous podcast that I did recently,
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.840]   somebody sitting right there in that chair told me,
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.220]   and I believe them, that I am codependent.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:20.080]   It's the first time anyone's ever called me that.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.000]   Codependent, she defined it, she spelled it out,
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.280]   and it, in a very parsimonious way,
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.360]   explained a huge array of challenges that I've experienced
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.160]   to the point where I've been learning
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.520]   more about codependency.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.440]   Okay, not easy for me to say even now.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.480]   - We're all interdependent.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.040]   - Interdependent, yeah.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:37.520]   Certainly depending on others is important,
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.960]   but certain patterns fall well
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.800]   under the umbrella of codependency.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.160]   So I was like, okay.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.880]   And even now I'm uncomfortable talking about it,
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.280]   which is part of the reason I'm trying
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:50.500]   to desensitize myself to the word itself,
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.800]   let alone drill into the process of getting through it.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.620]   So the point being that if our emotions
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.240]   are so strongly tethered to others,
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:01.840]   we see that as empathy, we label that typically as positive,
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:05.580]   but it really diminishes our ability to be there for people
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:09.900]   if their emotions are negative and about us.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.880]   - I disagree.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.400]   - Okay, great, great, fantastic.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.720]   - 'Cause that's empathy without emotional intelligence.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.560]   And so I work with a lot of doctors.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.360]   I've done quite a bit of work
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.160]   with the cancer hospital at Yale.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.800]   It's called Smilow.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.600]   And doctors have been taught from early on,
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.840]   you know, like leave your empathy at the door.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.280]   And I challenge that.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.560]   You know, when you're a patient with cancer,
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.600]   knowing that you may pass,
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.160]   the last thing you want is an unempathic doctor, right?
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.700]   You want a relationship with someone who's treating you.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:49.240]   And the assumption is that you get lost in your empathy.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.420]   And people have written about that.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.260]   And it's true.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.840]   It is overzealous empathy.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.800]   You can have compassion fatigue.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.800]   But again, it's in the absence of, you know,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.960]   emotional intelligence.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.920]   What do I mean?
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.080]   Well, part of emotional intelligence is regulation.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.080]   And so if I see my work as a cancer doctor as, you know,
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.320]   helping people have the best last few months of their lives,
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.540]   that's a really interesting way to think about it.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.080]   You know, so as I'm in relationship with my patient,
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.280]   my mindset is I've come to the understanding that my job,
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.700]   you know, people pass.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:29.240]   But I could go down a rabbit hole of despair
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.080]   because everyone potentially may pass.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.960]   Or I can see this as I'm giving someone a gift.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.960]   I'm giving them a gift of my presence.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.180]   I'm giving them a gift of them, you know,
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:43.140]   feeling held and cared for.
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:47.760]   And so to me, it's all about the framing, you know,
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.720]   of empathy.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.440]   Yes, of course, you know, if you're just,
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.320]   you can lose yourself in someone else's shoes,
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.360]   but that's not emotional intelligence.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.240]   Emotional intelligence is saying, you know what?
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.480]   I'm noticing myself, I'm getting lost in your feelings.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.120]   I need to pull back a little bit.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:10.680]   - Do we know where in the brain empathy resides?
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.920]   We hear so much about mirror neurons,
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.080]   but I think for those of us that have been in neuroscience
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.200]   and psychology long enough, we acknowledge,
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.180]   yes, there are appropriate conversations
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.760]   that include the words mirror neurons,
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.760]   but that they've been made out to be much more
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.080]   than perhaps they are in terms of empathy.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.160]   And they've become sort of the default description
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.800]   for all forms of empathy and understanding.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.440]   And it's not just that.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.160]   So what do we know about the brain science of empathy?
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.200]   - I don't know much about that, to be honest.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.360]   What I know more about
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.280]   is the kind of psychological experience of empathy,
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.260]   and that there are multiple forms of it.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:51.680]   So for example, there's the cognitive empathy piece
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.080]   where I, you know, I've never had your experience,
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.400]   but intellectually I get that you've suffered
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.340]   or intellectually I get your experience.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.320]   There's the emotional empathy, which is, you know,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.200]   when I meet other survivors of abuse who have felt shame,
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.800]   I understand what that means 'cause I've lived there.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.360]   And not that our experience was the same,
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.580]   but our feeling was the same.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.740]   We have a shared emotional experience.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.980]   And then on top of that,
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:19.380]   that compassionate kind of form of empathy
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.620]   is what I think is what we need much more of
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.100]   in our society, which is,
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.380]   we don't just cognitively understand where someone is
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.560]   or relate to their experience,
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.900]   but we feel compelled to be in relationship
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.660]   with that person and be supportive.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:34.700]   I'm thinking about something else
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:35.820]   that you spoke about earlier,
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:37.620]   which is this idea that like,
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.420]   and this is a misconstrual of my work and others' work,
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.540]   that the goal of this
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.660]   is to talk about feelings all day long.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.220]   Like, the last thing I want to do
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:47.220]   is talk about feelings all day long.
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.060]   Like, that is not helpful, actually.
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.380]   And I've had some experiences in my life,
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:55.500]   you know, where like, just to be blunt, shit happens,
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.580]   you know, and I call everybody I know,
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:59.940]   like my best friends, my family.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:00.860]   Can you believe this happened?
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.180]   I mean, I can't take it anymore.
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:03.940]   And then I hang up the phone and I did the same thing
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.500]   and they all listen to me.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:09.340]   And then I've spent two hours on the phone
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.060]   telling the same thing over and over again,
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.220]   talking about my feelings.
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:17.100]   And I feel worse 'cause I've rehearsed it 15 times.
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.140]   That's not emotional intelligence, right?
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:20.380]   When we're emotionally intelligent,
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.740]   we recognize and we know that just talking about it
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:26.300]   is actually not helpful.
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.620]   Like, we need to be with someone who's that active listener,
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:31.060]   who's nonjudgmental, who shows compassion.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.220]   But when you're compassionate,
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.140]   you actually are bringing you back to the person saying,
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:39.460]   you know, is this, you know, the right thing right now
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.900]   for you, you know, what else might you think about?
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.580]   You know, I know when I've had really difficult experiences,
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.700]   you know, the person who says things like,
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:52.660]   maybe, could you just jump in the hot air balloon
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:54.860]   for a minute, Mark, and look down at your life?
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:57.580]   And like, besides this one thing that you feel like
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:58.940]   is the worst thing that's ever happened to you
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:01.100]   in your whole life, anything else going right?
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.340]   I mean, yeah, my partner loves me,
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.340]   my dogs love me unconditionally.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.540]   I got great friends, oh yeah.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.620]   All of a sudden, that little thing that's activating you
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.940]   is not so big anymore.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:12.340]   That's emotional intelligence, right,
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.700]   is not getting lost in the empathy,
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:18.300]   not just endlessly talking about feelings
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.020]   to the point where there's no strategies.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.820]   And I think that that's really interesting
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:27.980]   because it goes back to something important,
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:30.540]   which is the permission to feel characteristics
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:33.180]   of nonjudgment, active listening,
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:37.220]   and empathy, compassion, never.
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:39.860]   And I'm talking, I have tens of thousands of people
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.140]   who've done this.
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:46.140]   Does anyone say, fixer, problem solver?
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.260]   I don't even get smart or wise.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:51.940]   When we think about the people who create the conditions
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:53.420]   for us to be our true selves,
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.700]   we don't think about the wisest, smartest,
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:57.380]   fixer, problem solver.
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:59.860]   We think about the nonjudgmental listener
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.900]   who shows compassion.
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.580]   And I think that has to be reinforced
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:07.820]   that some of the fear that we have
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.740]   is that we're gonna get lost in all these feelings,
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:14.100]   but no one's asking you to get lost in their feelings.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:16.980]   What they're asking for is support.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.780]   They're asking you to just listen
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.100]   and to maybe ask me a few questions
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.900]   to help me clarify my experience
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:27.800]   and then help me on a path towards feeling better.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.220]   - Yeah, I keep hearing that the way to do this properly
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:38.220]   is to ask questions as opposed to telling people
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.500]   what they need to do.
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:43.980]   Your friend or this person who was an effective source
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:46.180]   of support in that moment said,
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:48.420]   can you get in the hot air balloon
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.820]   and look down on your life?
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.620]   I noticed that they didn't say,
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.700]   get in the hot air balloon for a second and then do this.
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:58.580]   As a former partner of mine said,
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:00.100]   who I'm still on great terms with,
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.760]   no one likes to be shifted.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.100]   - Yeah, no one wants to be told what to do.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.220]   - Right, no one wants to be shifted.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:06.940]   No one, no matter what state they're in, high or low,
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.580]   want somebody to come along and try and shift them.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:12.940]   - Or just tell them like, go for a walk.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.460]   Okay, well, why am I, to do what?
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:16.660]   - Or meditate.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.020]   That one's become equally grating
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:21.420]   when it's probably a great thing to do,
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:23.900]   but perhaps there's a different way
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.280]   posed in the form of a question
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.020]   that would be more effective.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.380]   I think the hot air balloon example
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:31.260]   also brings to mind something.
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.300]   I'll try and keep this as succinct as possible
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.420]   for your sake and for the audience sake.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.820]   But having studied stress a bit in my laboratory
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:41.220]   and experienced a lot of stress
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.260]   as most people have in their lifetime,
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:45.740]   it's very clear that when we stress,
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:48.380]   our mental aperture, our visual aperture,
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:51.500]   our auditory aperture, everything shrinks, right?
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.880]   It contracts.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.320]   And we know that getting a different spatial perspective
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.400]   gives us a different temporal perspective.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.920]   We can start thinking about our life,
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:04.320]   bend in larger pieces and get that perspective
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.360]   of the things that in life that are going well.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.920]   There's a meditation that, I guess it's a meditation,
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.760]   I don't know what to call it,
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.360]   that I started doing years ago when I was a junior professor
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.000]   because life was so stressful for tenure.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.720]   And little did I know that it just continues
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:25.980]   to be stressful, but a pleasure to do the work.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:28.740]   That involves basically doing a standard type meditation
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:31.000]   for a few breaths of closing my eyes
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.520]   and focusing on my body and what's going on internally,
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.040]   but then opening my eyes and focusing on something external
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.160]   like my hand or the room,
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.600]   and then going to the pale blue dot.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.440]   - Sure.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.600]   - It's a very wide aperture.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:45.440]   So effectively the hot air balloon looking down.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.560]   - It's distancing.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.640]   - Distancing, right?
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:50.660]   And making this a practice, not in a moment of stress,
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.280]   but each morning as I start the day
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.820]   as a kind of reminder that our brains,
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:58.040]   our cognition and our emotions
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.800]   go through tremendous state differentiation,
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.200]   like these complete, we're kind of different people
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:06.600]   under these different space-time references.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.240]   And that when we're in stress,
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:12.680]   we tend to get locked into one space-time reference.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.400]   And I'm not trying to be cosmic about this,
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:19.160]   but the nature of stress is to have us anchor
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:22.240]   to the stressor and to put up mental walls
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.240]   to break out of that and physical walls.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.800]   So it sounds like great supporters,
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.600]   and we can help ourselves through the more unpleasant
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.840]   portions of the emotion scale, if we want to,
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:41.120]   by taking ourselves into this different perspective,
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:45.560]   using spatial tools, hot air balloon, pale blue dot.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.960]   - Questions to yourself, say things like,
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.360]   Mark, I mean, I travel a lot,
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.160]   and I was just in Washington State
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.480]   for some presentations before this,
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.280]   flight delays, and my flight got canceled.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.880]   I missed a dinner.
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:03.280]   And I used to get really worked up about it.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.720]   And I would just take a seat at the airport,
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:06.960]   take a nice long inhale.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.080]   I'm like, Mark, is this really gonna be something
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.400]   that's gonna bother you next week?
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.240]   I'm working on a book.
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.160]   I'm like, I got another night in a hotel to work.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.120]   I actually reframed it as an opportunity
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.400]   to have some space and write.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.360]   And so you can use these techniques a lot.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:24.360]   Going back to my dad, so my dad, as he got older,
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.200]   his anger did come back, and he was kind of,
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.960]   I remember this one time where we're at a family dinner,
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.920]   and I had already been in my position for a while.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.240]   And there was a little bit of resentment with my father,
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.520]   because he was a blue-collar worker
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.680]   and a very, very talented air conditioning repairman
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.800]   and had a good career.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:51.960]   But all of a sudden, he went to graduate school
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:55.040]   and got PhDs, and that was, you know,
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:59.000]   it was a little bit difficult for my father at some time.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000]   And so when I got a job at Yale, in particular,
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.440]   he got a little, there was some emotions about that.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.600]   And I remember we were at this one dinner,
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.600]   and basically he, I'm not gonna repeat what he said,
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.640]   'cause it's really gross,
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.360]   but he said something like, you know,
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.880]   "Mark, you think your blank doesn't stink anymore."
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:21.240]   And I was like, "Eesh."
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.880]   And then he just kind of went on and on and on.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:26.080]   And I had to make a choice, like, do I start crying,
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.160]   you know, like in the middle of this dinner,
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.080]   'cause I feel so violated by my father?
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.440]   Do I, like, tell him to go blank himself
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.240]   and walk out of the room?
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.960]   And I decided to use a distancing technique.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.760]   I decided to make him into a movie.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.960]   I decided that he was now a TV show,
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.440]   and that TV show was something I was observing
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.200]   and not feeling.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:48.160]   And that has proven to be
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.200]   one of the most powerful strategies for me,
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.000]   is when I'm in a position with someone
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.480]   who has a lot of negative energy,
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.960]   and as a kid who was bullied,
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.320]   I'm more affected by these things, I think.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.280]   I create that psychological distance
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.960]   by just putting that picture frame up there,
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.680]   and I just observe it.
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.000]   And I kind of ask myself questions about it.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.200]   I'm like, "Wow."
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.160]   Or I say things like, you know,
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:12.160]   "Wow, that's really interesting.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.800]   "I wonder where that, I get curious about it.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.280]   "Like, I wonder where that's coming from."
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:20.040]   You know, what was his childhood like that he's so angry?
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.120]   And it really is helpful.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.560]   So these are very powerful techniques.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.720]   - That can be used in real time, as you just described.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:27.520]   - Very real time.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.360]   I use them all the time.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.080]   You know, I'm at the grocery store,
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.440]   you know, I'm not gonna get into my issues,
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.960]   but, you know, I'm like,
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.640]   and I grew up with, you know,
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:38.920]   I would say lower middle class.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.640]   We were very, we didn't have a lot of money.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.280]   Everything was on a budget.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.720]   And, you know, I'm fortunate to be
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.680]   in a different circumstance now, but I'm still cheap.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.880]   And so my partner, I'm like, "I don't understand.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:49.960]   "Like, we're not buying that.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.040]   "Like, that is ridiculous.
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:54.160]   "Like, we're not spending $7 on a bottle
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:55.760]   "of organic almond milk."
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.640]   You're like, "I'm not doing it.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:57.920]   "We're not doing it."
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.400]   And then I have to like move away from the aisle,
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.280]   take a little walk.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.440]   I'm like, "Mark, you know,
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.100]   "is this worth your relationship, the almond milk?
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:07.940]   "Like, really?
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.060]   "Is this what you're gonna do?"
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.560]   And so like, I don't know.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.860]   Maybe I'm just the only one who needs regulation
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.280]   like 300 times a day.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.800]   But I find that I've, you know, different strategies.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.280]   Like the picture frame works when I'm angry
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.720]   or someone is angry with me.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.800]   My anxiety, I get into the hot air balloon and I look down.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.480]   When I'm like irritated with someone,
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.800]   I just take to walk away and I ask myself,
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.640]   "Is this really that important?"
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.400]   And that's what I hope people will learn
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.520]   is that there's so many amazing strategies out there
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.980]   and that we use them interchangeably
[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:43.340]   with different emotions and different contexts.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:47.540]   - While a lot of the stereotypes dating back to the,
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:49.900]   you know, let's just say in 1930s
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.460]   through to the end of the 1970s
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:57.460]   seem to couch people as more stoic,
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:00.420]   less emotionally expressive, especially in public
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:02.660]   or with people that they weren't very close with.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:03.740]   There was also a tendency,
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.820]   at least in movies about that time,
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.400]   for people who were passionate
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.400]   to be rewarded for expressions of their passion.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.840]   So it's kind of two ends of the spectrum, right?
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:17.460]   We always think of the kind of the real stoic thing,
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:22.200]   both for male and female phenotypes, right?
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:25.520]   You look at movies from the 30s and 40s, you see that,
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.140]   but you also saw intense expression, passionate expression.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:35.300]   And now I suppose we're in a bit of a new place
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.760]   where I think there's an invitation.
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:40.260]   I like to think there's an invitation
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.140]   for a broader range of emotional expressions
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.760]   and phenotypes, let's call them.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.660]   I'm a biologist after all.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:49.440]   It's also a safe word to use still, I think.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.040]   You can use the word phenotypes.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.760]   Stereotypes is a bit loaded, a lot loaded.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:00.840]   But emotionality and the notion
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.440]   of people being overly emotional has,
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:06.920]   unfortunately, a bit of a negative-
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.500]   - It does. - Tinge to it.
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.940]   Whereas somebody being passionate,
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:12.240]   that sounds like a pretty good thing.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.100]   - Well, emotional is like historically,
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.040]   like you're hysterical.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:19.240]   It means that you are not in control of your emotions.
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.000]   I don't like to use that term ever.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.920]   I just find it a useless term.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.500]   And 'cause that's when,
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:27.360]   oftentimes when people think about emotions,
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.040]   they think of people being emotional.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:32.400]   And I just don't even know what that means.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:35.500]   It has just connotations from the past
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.100]   that I don't think are helpful.
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:38.860]   - Maybe that's why my graduate advisor said,
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.600]   "Instead of telling you to be careful,
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.700]   I'll tell you to be mindful,
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:45.300]   because the opposite of mindful is mindless,
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.340]   and then you'll remember."
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:48.180]   - Yeah, and also, exactly.
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.680]   But going back, you'll hear people say,
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:51.660]   "Why are you so emotional?"
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:54.620]   And again, that's a place of judgment.
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.820]   What they're saying is that you're experiencing
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.880]   a strong emotion that's making me uncomfortable.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.520]   I don't know what to do with that feeling.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.500]   So by me labeling you as emotional, I can alienate you.
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:06.580]   Where's that going to lead to?
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:08.420]   Not good communication, right?
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.580]   Not healthy relationships.
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:13.980]   - And yet we reward people still for being passionate,
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:16.260]   even if it's tinged with some anger.
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:17.540]   Like if somebody has a cause
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.540]   that they're really passionate about,
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:21.580]   we don't necessarily say they're being emotional.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.300]   We say they're really passionate about this.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.580]   There seems to be a subtle difference.
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:25.420]   - There is.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:28.500]   - That maybe it's rooted in a kind of a trajectory
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.720]   of like trying to achieve a specific outcome,
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:32.680]   whereas just anger or sadness,
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:36.040]   kind of just, you know, geysering out of us,
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.480]   it doesn't seem like it's directed towards an end point.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.320]   - It's less personal.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.640]   - Right, it's more evocative.
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:42.280]   - The emotional is the judgment, right?
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.040]   When I say, you know, "Andrew, you're so emotional," right?
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.860]   It's also can be a form of gaslighting, right?
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:50.560]   Which is I'm trying to get you to believe something
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.720]   about yourself that I want you to believe,
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.520]   which may not be a reality at all,
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:57.600]   which is usually problematic in our society.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.760]   I think most of our low self-esteem
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.620]   comes from gaslighting in our childhoods.
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:04.060]   - People gaslighting each other.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.620]   - Yeah, I think that's the beginning of bullying,
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:08.100]   which is that, you know, "Mark, you're too skinny.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:09.080]   "Mark, you're too overweight.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.260]   "Mark, your nose is too big.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.260]   "Mark, your nose is too small.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:12.220]   "Mark, you're too feminine.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:13.860]   "Mark, you're too masculine."
[01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:18.140]   And then all of a sudden there's no feelings mentors,
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:21.180]   there's no education, and I just start believing it.
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.380]   And then it becomes my reality.
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:24.500]   It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.340]   And it's awful.
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.620]   I mean, you see it all the time.
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:30.100]   We're not born being self-critics.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:35.100]   We're born being experience-dependent, right?
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.620]   We depend on relationships.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:40.480]   And if those relationships are meaning cruel
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.880]   and people are gaslighters, well, guess what?
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:48.540]   That's gonna end up being how we think about ourselves.
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:50.660]   - In your book, you include a number
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.180]   of really wonderful quotes,
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:56.140]   but one of them that I anchored to very quickly
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:54:02.180]   is the following, "All learning has an emotional base,"
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:05.500]   and it was none other than Plato that said that.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.660]   What is the relationship between emotions
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:10.020]   and learning and decision-making?
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.180]   - Let's think about right now, right?
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:17.700]   Our interaction, right, as a teacher, right?
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:20.300]   I mean, how many of you have ever been,
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:22.020]   meaning your listeners and you,
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:23.980]   like how many of us have ever been in a situation
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.220]   in a classroom where it's like,
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:28.780]   "All right, everybody, let's turn to page 357.
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.700]   "All right, Mark, you're gonna read paragraph one,
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:33.640]   "and Andrew, you're gonna read paragraph two,"
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.920]   and your brain is immediately gone.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.520]   So emotions drive our attention.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:41.940]   It's so clear, right?
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.020]   If we're not feeling engaged or curious,
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.620]   we're gonna be bored.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:47.740]   And again, boredom, not a bad emotion.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:50.700]   It just means like what's being presented to me
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:53.420]   and the way it's being presented is not meeting my needs.
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:56.540]   It's not engaging me, so my brain needs to do something.
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:57.820]   I'm just gonna go doodle.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:59.300]   I'm gonna go push the kid here.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:00.860]   I'm gonna get on my phone.
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.580]   It's just where we wanted,
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:04.800]   our brains are wanting to do things.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:11.020]   When we're in environments where there's a lot of curiosity,
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:15.620]   where there is high engagement, attention is much better.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:18.320]   So that's the simplest thing to think about.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.620]   In my work, my whole career has been
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:26.180]   about building curriculum to help educators
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:31.140]   integrate emotions into their everyday classroom.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.860]   And part of what we help them understand,
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:34.800]   going back to that mood meter,
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.300]   think about that for a minute.
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:39.940]   A lot of us, because of our dispositions,
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:42.620]   we tend to speak with a certain cadence.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:45.580]   We tend to present in a certain way.
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:48.460]   And if you're someone who lives in the green,
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:52.140]   you're just calm and content and tranquil and peaceful.
[01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:53.140]   - The spa people.
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:55.260]   - All right, some of the yoga teachers,
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:57.940]   let's all turn our attentions to ourselves.
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:59.240]   They're great, I love yoga.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.020]   But my point is, if you're always in that green quadrant,
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:04.220]   for me, even though I'm living there a lot,
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:08.060]   it's like, give me some energy, please.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:09.520]   And then there's like, I have a friend
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.980]   who is a principal of a middle school in San Francisco,
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:14.300]   and she's a former tennis coach,
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.620]   and she walks into the school,
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:17.820]   team, let's go, go, go, every day.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:21.380]   It's like, Heather, come on, you're overwhelming me.
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.660]   And then you've got people who might be
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.620]   in that kind of blue quadrant.
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:29.220]   It's like, we've done some education work in the past,
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:34.060]   and let's be real, how much education reform really matters.
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:37.820]   Mark, you do all this research, but who's reading it?
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:38.900]   Is anybody really reading it?
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:39.860]   - Such a downer.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:43.380]   - Yeah, or that person who's always in the red,
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:45.580]   that's activated, it's caustic.
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:50.820]   And so my point here is that we're gonna default
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:53.500]   in many ways to being in one of these quadrants,
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:57.100]   maybe all day long, maybe part of the day.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:00.600]   But as someone who is leading,
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:04.400]   'cause I consider leadership teaching,
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.700]   someone who's managing a team,
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:09.820]   as a teacher in a classroom, as a parent, couple, whatever,
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.060]   I've gotta be aware of kind of where I live emotionally,
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:15.180]   and I've gotta be aware that not everybody wants to be
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:18.300]   with me where I'm at, and my job is to create
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:20.620]   an emotional rollercoaster ride for people,
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:22.660]   to bring people on an emotional journey,
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.460]   'cause that's what's gonna keep them interested.
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:26.540]   And believe it or not, from our research
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.500]   and others' research, we know that certain emotions
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.640]   are better for certain things.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.380]   So for example, if I want my high school students
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:35.380]   to be like really brainstorming ideas,
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:37.740]   I'm not gonna put on like a Gregorian chant.
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.820]   (imitates Gregorian chant)
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.020]   I'm gonna put on, you know, go back to Lady Gaga,
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.900]   you know, I'm on the edge of glory,
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:46.540]   and like, let's get pumped up, and like,
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.620]   everybody, let's get the post-its out there,
[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:51.500]   and everybody's excited and just brainstorming.
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.220]   But then, you know, which one are we,
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:56.260]   like, what's gonna be the project?
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:58.620]   You can't be all hyped up, 'cause then your brain
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:02.980]   is not in a very kind of a building consensus
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:05.640]   kind of model, mode.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:08.660]   So when we bring our energy level down,
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.780]   it's like, oh, let me think about it for a minute.
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:13.180]   It's more, you're more thoughtful, you're more careful,
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:14.740]   you're more like, I don't know.
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:18.620]   Then, like, people would say, well, why would blue,
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:22.660]   why would, you know, unpleasant, low energy be helpful?
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.820]   Well, believe it or not, oftentimes,
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:26.660]   we can be much more detail-oriented
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:28.740]   when we're in that low energy, unpleasant place.
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:30.920]   It's like writing, I do a lot of grant writing, right?
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:34.200]   It's like, I think it's great, not a great idea.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:37.860]   Mark, like, put on the classical music,
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.060]   like, zone everybody out, get into that place
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:43.700]   where you are gonna look for every I to dot,
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:45.540]   every comma that should be a semicolon,
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:48.940]   every dash that should be this, paragraph matching.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:50.900]   You can't do that when you're really super excited.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:53.420]   It just isn't, your brain doesn't operate that way.
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:56.660]   And then people say red, like, why would red be great?
[01:58:56.660 --> 01:58:58.540]   The best story I have for that is,
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:01.860]   so I actually did a collaboration with Lady Gaga
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:03.700]   and her foundation, Born This Way Foundation,
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:07.900]   many years ago, and we did a study
[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:11.180]   of thousands of high school students across America.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.980]   And we looked at how do they feel when they're in school?
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:17.420]   And what we found was, 77% of the feelings,
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:20.460]   and I repeat that, 77% of their emotions
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:21.860]   at school were unpleasant.
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:26.060]   Tired, bored, and stressed were the top three back then.
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:29.340]   So we did this study, we were working on it,
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:32.100]   it was a big project called the Emotion Revolution.
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:33.320]   And we ended up going to the White House
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.380]   to present our findings.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:37.000]   I had to make a decision.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.980]   Like, I had the Secretary of Education at that time
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:41.380]   in front of me, I'm presenting this big study
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:44.060]   on the emotional lives of teenagers.
[01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:45.860]   Do I wanna go in there and like, you know,
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:47.580]   I've got an amazing study to share with you.
[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.280]   I'm like, hmm, not so great.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.700]   Do I wanna go in there like,
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:56.580]   Secretary, let's just take a nice long inhale and an exhale.
[01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:58.300]   That's not gonna go over so well.
[01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.860]   Do I wanna go in the blue?
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:04.860]   Like, you know, it's pretty bad out there.
[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:07.600]   No, I decided that red was my quadrant.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.860]   I wanted the people in the education department
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:14.020]   to be fired up by this research.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:17.160]   I want them to be, I want them to feel the passion
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:19.240]   that I had and the anger that I had,
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:23.320]   that it is an injustice for kids to feel that way
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:24.280]   in our nation's schools.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.120]   We need to figure out what to do
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:28.840]   to create a more engaging learning environment.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.840]   And so I decided to really present that in that way.
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.720]   I didn't present the findings and like, look at the data.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:36.720]   I'm like, I want you to really take a look at these data.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.360]   Please, 77% of the, I mean,
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:42.760]   I'm saying 77% of the emotions, tired, bored, and stressed.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:45.400]   How is that gonna lead to a nation filled with people
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.620]   who are innovative and creative
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.240]   and making a difference in the world?
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:49.080]   Think about it.
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.000]   We know how emotions drive the way we behave.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.400]   If you're tired, bored, and stressed all day long,
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:55.840]   what's the result?
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.720]   And so I presented it that way.
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:00.400]   And, you know, I did the best I could.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:06.340]   And I think that's the magic of understanding emotion.
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:09.320]   Does that, does this resonate?
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.360]   That we're gonna be intentional
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.560]   about the emotions that we feel
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:16.380]   and that the emotions that we create in environments,
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:19.440]   whether they're at home or at school or in the workplace,
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:24.440]   because certain emotions work better for certain things.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.080]   - Yeah, your examples bring me back
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:32.080]   to your earlier mention of this brilliant five-year-old kid
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.800]   who realized that his current emotional state
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:38.160]   was like the weather.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.960]   It's going to change.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.720]   In order to have that perspective,
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:49.120]   my guess is that he had to have already at some point
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.040]   moved from the blue quadrant,
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:54.800]   so low energy, low pleasantness, to the green quadrant.
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:57.320]   You know, high pleasantness, low energy,
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.920]   to the yellow quadrant, perhaps not in this order.
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:02.360]   And yes, I'm using this to remind people about the quadrants,
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.520]   higher energy, higher pleasantness,
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:08.000]   and then red, high energy, low pleasantness.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.880]   - Yes, well, 'cause he's checking in daily, right?
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:15.500]   So in this school, which we call a ruler school,
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.600]   that's what they do.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:18.680]   Kids check in in the morning
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.440]   and other times throughout the day,
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.000]   and they start to recognize
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.720]   that I can feel this way at one point of the day,
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:27.240]   and I can feel this way at another point of the day.
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:29.720]   And if I'm feeling this way and I'm about to do something
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.800]   where that feeling is not great,
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.400]   I can shift out of that feeling,
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.440]   or I can still feel that feeling and still be a good learner.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.640]   I mean, that's incredible to me that we can do that.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.840]   And I see it in thousands of schools,
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:43.560]   and it's done remarkably well.
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:46.440]   - And you've developed an app that's freely available
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.520]   that allows people to essentially press the screen.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.960]   Is that right? - Yes.
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.840]   - And to denote where they are
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.520]   on this energy versus pleasantness scale
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:01.820]   at numerous times throughout the day and night,
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:02.660]   if they choose.
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:04.800]   We'll provide a link to this app in the show note captions.
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.080]   - It's called How We Feel.
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.400]   - Yeah, I've used it before,
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.320]   and a previous version I need to update
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.120]   and get the new version, and I will.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:14.320]   I found it to be immensely useful
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:16.640]   just to start thinking about emotions
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.040]   along this energy versus pleasantness axis.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:23.120]   After one does this for a few days or weeks,
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.120]   maybe checking in and touching the app,
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:28.960]   I don't know, a couple of times a day,
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:31.600]   maybe again in the evening upon waking,
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.860]   what sort of data or information does one get back
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:36.440]   that can be informative
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:39.280]   toward being a healthier, happier person?
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.480]   Ah, excuse me, a healthier person.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.940]   - More contented. - More contented.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:45.820]   Well, what's really cool about the app,
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:47.240]   and the reason why we have an app,
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.080]   is that technology can be super helpful,
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:52.840]   in this instance, for building self-awareness.
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:56.320]   So if I set reminders, which you can do on the app,
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:58.200]   to check in in the morning,
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:00.280]   maybe after lunch or right before I go home,
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.640]   you know, you pick whatever works for you,
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.280]   or you can do it randomly,
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.880]   and then you aggregate your data across time,
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.440]   right now you have instances of your emotions over time,
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:10.720]   but what's also cool about it
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:13.080]   is that you can disaggregate your data
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.380]   by things like who you're with,
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:18.300]   or where you're at, or what you're doing,
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:19.620]   and then you can analyze that,
[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:21.260]   so you get your little mood meters
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:22.660]   that are all different colors,
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:26.380]   because, wow, I thought I was more in the yellow at work,
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:28.540]   but I'm actually more in the blue at work,
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:30.200]   or I thought when I'm with this person,
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:31.900]   I'm actually feeling calm,
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.220]   actually, when I look at my data,
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.740]   I'm always anxious with that person.
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:36.260]   - So it runs a reverse correlation.
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:38.500]   - Yes, yeah. - Fantastic.
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.060]   - And then you can just look at your report,
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:42.900]   and then it asks you questions to get more insights.
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.680]   - And also, importantly, we've embedded
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:47.300]   a lot of the strategies that I've been talking about,
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:49.080]   so like these distancing strategies,
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.840]   or the breathing exercises, or the mindfulness exercises,
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.920]   or gratitude exercises, which, by the way,
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.520]   I was thinking in the back of my head
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.300]   as we were speaking about the Envy Reduction Program,
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:02.260]   I think the number one thing is gratitude,
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:06.800]   that if our brains are just endlessly searching
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:10.400]   for what's better that's out there than what I have,
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:13.020]   we're not experiencing any gratitude for what we have,
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:14.860]   and so I spend a lot of time helping people
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:16.740]   really understand, like, take a look,
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:19.240]   like, look where you're at as a student.
[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:21.300]   Think about where you have the opportunity to learn.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.540]   Think about the opportunities you have in life,
[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:24.440]   and all of a sudden, it's like,
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:26.560]   oh, yeah, my life is pretty good,
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:29.500]   as opposed to everyone else's life is better than mine.
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:33.000]   So gratitude for me, sometimes it feels cliche these days,
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.300]   you know, you've heard so much about it,
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:37.140]   and I can't talk strongly enough
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:40.440]   about both the practice and the science that supports it.
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:41.660]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:45.640]   When I did an episode about gratitude now some years ago,
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:49.080]   I was positively shocked to see the data.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.000]   - Yeah.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.500]   - The data on gratitude practices are so striking
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.240]   in terms of whether or not one looks
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.040]   at neurotransmitter expression,
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:02.080]   or whether one looks at happiness rating scales,
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:06.160]   or learning, ability to learn.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:07.540]   So many things are improved
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:09.740]   by even short gratitude practices.
[02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:10.580]   - Exactly.
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:12.020]   - And it was interesting for me to realize
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:15.320]   that not only do effective gratitude practices
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:18.380]   include thinking about what one has,
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:23.380]   but also in observing others expressing their own gratitude,
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.820]   either towards us or towards others.
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:26.660]   - Yeah.
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.180]   - So, you know, there's something about the human brain
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.420]   that really thrives on gratitude.
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:32.660]   And the other thing that I think is worth mentioning,
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.920]   you said these students could,
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:37.960]   through a gratitude practice,
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:39.800]   realize the opportunity that they have.
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:42.040]   I think a lot of people default to the assumption
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.600]   that a gratitude practice will make them complacent.
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:45.440]   - Yeah.
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:48.600]   - And stop seeking to reach their goals.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.340]   But actually the opposite is true.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:52.480]   There's a smaller research, as far as I understand,
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.480]   maybe it's expanded in recent years,
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:57.080]   where if people do a regular gratitude practice,
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.720]   even five minutes a day,
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.360]   their achievement actually increases as well.
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:06.160]   So gratitude and complacency are not on,
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.660]   they're not in the same bin.
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:08.500]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:10.480]   These are all evidence-based strategies
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:13.040]   to help us have a better life.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:16.400]   - So clearly you're on a mission and it's a wonderful,
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.940]   in fact, admirable one at that,
[02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:22.400]   to bring more emotional awareness.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.240]   Can we call it that?
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.480]   - Sure. - Emotional awareness
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:26.960]   to kids and to adults to better the world.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.060]   I don't think I'm, you know, overreaching there.
[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:30.260]   I think that's the goal.
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:32.900]   I'd like to get back to your origin story a bit
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:35.300]   to understand a little bit more
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:37.820]   about the motivation behind the goal.
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:39.600]   You've written about in your book
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.640]   and you've spoken a little bit today
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.920]   about the fact that you were bullied pretty viciously.
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:45.760]   - Yeah.
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:48.520]   - And also were the target of abuse.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:49.400]   - Yeah.
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:52.940]   - And when one thinks about bullying in particular,
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:57.860]   we, I think all hopefully naturally default to,
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:59.660]   okay, how can we stop bullies?
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.780]   But I'm guessing this is a two-sided issue
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:06.760]   and I'm not trying to create empathy for bullies here,
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:11.000]   but I'm guessing that in order to really disintegrate
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000]   the bullying problem down to zero,
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.200]   which would be the ultimate goal.
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:16.160]   - Sounds great to me.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:18.800]   - Yeah, that we need to get into the minds
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:21.440]   of both the bullied and the bullies.
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:22.260]   - Correct.
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:23.980]   - And as uncomfortable as that might be,
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:28.160]   maybe this is an opportunity to, you know,
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:29.680]   embrace some of the very practices
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:30.940]   that you've been talking about.
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:31.780]   - Yeah.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.160]   - So if you would,
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:35.560]   could you tell us a little bit about how, as a kid,
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.020]   how you perceived your bullies?
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:39.600]   I'm very curious about that.
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.060]   I can say I've never been bullied,
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:44.560]   but I've also not been a bully.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.860]   I can easily say, I was thinking about this
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:50.580]   during our brief break there, I hate bullies.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:51.660]   Like I like hate them.
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:54.740]   I'm like right there in the red, low pleasantness,
[02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:56.220]   like top, top corner there.
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:58.120]   Like it activates me physically.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.240]   Like it makes me angry,
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:01.060]   makes me want to do something about it.
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:03.160]   But as somebody who was bullied,
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:04.660]   how did you perceive your bullies?
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.720]   Did you think they were like correct or the authority?
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:13.660]   And how have you embraced whatever understanding that was
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:17.060]   and morphed it over time to be able to think about
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:19.000]   how to solve the bullying problem,
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000]   both from the perspective of the bullied and the bully?
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.020]   - Yeah, that's gonna,
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:27.280]   we're gonna have a couple of days together for this.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.880]   You know, I think, you know,
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:32.800]   when I think about my eight-year-old self,
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.380]   10-year-old self, 11-year-old self being bullied.
[02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:40.560]   Remember, bullying is about a power imbalance.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.360]   That's one of the core elements of it.
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.460]   It's about the intent to harm,
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:48.480]   which is, it's not conflict.
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.100]   It's not like sibling rivalry.
[02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:52.720]   It's intention to harm, you know,
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:54.680]   where there's a power imbalance and, you know,
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:57.440]   how long and the repetition of it.
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:59.480]   Those are the three key factors in bullying.
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:02.080]   It's repeated, it's intended to harm
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:04.360]   and there's a power imbalance.
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:07.780]   And so that puts you in a really powerless position
[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:08.620]   when you think about it,
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:12.400]   when you have nobody to support you, no upstanders,
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:15.920]   no one else around you to help you get out of this situation.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:18.320]   What happens is that you feel fear.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.860]   And what I felt, and it's been the emotion
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:24.700]   that I've struggled with my whole life is shame.
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.420]   Because what happens when you're bullied often
[02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:31.180]   is that you are made to feel like you are not worthy.
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:32.740]   It's diminished self-worth.
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.520]   'Cause I've got power over you.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:35.940]   I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want to you.
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:37.100]   I'm gonna say whatever I want to say.
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:38.020]   I'm gonna spit on you.
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:39.860]   I'm gonna throw you into the locker.
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:41.860]   I'm gonna, you know, do crazy stuff,
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:43.360]   which is what happened to me.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.900]   And guess what?
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:48.140]   There's nothing you can do about it.
[02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:49.760]   And when you're in an environment
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:53.000]   where nobody does anything about it, it creates despair.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]   So you can see how there's a lot of emotions there.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.600]   And I'll tell you right now,
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:00.460]   one of my hardest memories of being a student
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.560]   in around 10th, I mean, when I was around 10 years old,
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:08.560]   is that I remember being in a classroom in math
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.680]   and I was wearing like a vest,
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:13.800]   like a down vest as a protection.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.200]   It was like my thing to hold on to,
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:19.620]   like my little vest was gonna be protective of me.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:20.780]   The only problem was I had two bullies
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:22.600]   sitting on either side of me.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.180]   And what they did throughout the entire class
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.900]   was they used pen and they just drew,
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:28.940]   like wrote things about me on my jacket.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:33.740]   And I can still remember, like you're sitting across from me,
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:35.900]   you being my teacher.
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:39.220]   And I can still remember locking eyes with my teacher
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:40.520]   and him just looking away.
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:45.920]   And that feeling that you have of complete despair,
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:49.480]   like how is it that I'm not being protected
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:52.240]   by this adult in my community?
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.200]   And so that's the issue that we're trying to solve for.
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.920]   Now, I could make all kinds of excuses about the teacher.
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:00.960]   Maybe he didn't really notice.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:02.860]   I don't buy it 'cause it was repeated over time
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:04.200]   and it was happening a lot.
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:09.320]   I could also say that maybe he misread my facial expression.
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.400]   I'm not buying that either.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.140]   I think it was either he had a mindset,
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:16.060]   you know, this is a rite of passage,
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.460]   you gotta toughen up, kiddo,
[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:20.340]   or you're not gonna survive in your Clifton High School.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:24.560]   Or another point is that he just was like,
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.260]   I have no idea what to do about it
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.900]   and I'm just gonna let it go.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.420]   None of those are an option for me anymore.
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:33.420]   It's just not acceptable.
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:37.100]   And so we need to teach people skills.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.420]   People need to be emotionally perceptive,
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:41.480]   like emotions are signals.
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.640]   I mean, that's an important point of this conversation.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:47.040]   My facial expression,
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.600]   which was probably one of depression, fear, and shame,
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:54.520]   which is not one of a big smile in general,
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:55.840]   obviously there's variability,
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.280]   but point is that it's pretty clear
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.640]   when you're wearing a jacket
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:02.160]   and sitting like this in your classroom with a hoodie on,
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:04.040]   you know, doing your work and people are writing on you,
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.400]   you're not in a good place.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:11.500]   How that perception of my experience, my emotion
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:15.880]   was not a signal to do something blows my mind.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.700]   It blows my mind, I'm just saying.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:22.700]   I can't imagine an adult being in a situation
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.900]   with a child that is being treated that way
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:27.180]   and not thinking action.
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:29.180]   But yet we see it all the time.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:30.540]   All the time we see it.
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:31.780]   - Even nowadays?
[02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:32.740]   - All the time.
[02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:34.220]   By the way, the research shows that bullying
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:36.460]   has not really decreased in the last 30, 40 years.
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.140]   Really, no, it has not.
[02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:41.860]   It's pretty much about a third of middle school,
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:44.540]   high school kids get bullied each day in school.
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:47.400]   And so this is the point of my work,
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.060]   which is that a lot of the programs out there
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:51.220]   are like let's create school rules.
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:52.600]   All right, who's gonna follow these rules?
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:55.780]   Like what is, how are rules teaching people skills?
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.340]   It's not working.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:59.260]   My whole thinking about this is that we need
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:01.500]   to teach the things that we've been talking about.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.840]   Empathy, perspective taking, you know, doing role plays,
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:06.660]   having people understand what it feels like
[02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:07.820]   to be in that situation.
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:09.660]   Like you said, you've never been bullied, right?
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:12.260]   And never have bullied, which is great for you.
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:14.500]   Which means it might be harder for you to understand that
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:18.300]   because the empathy for you might be a little tougher.
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:20.020]   - Yeah, that's part of the reason I asked the question.
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:23.100]   I mean, I was debating to myself whether or not
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.660]   I ask it in that way
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.700]   because I didn't want to come across as insensitive.
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.900]   - No, it's not that you care.
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:31.220]   - Precisely because I have sat on neither side
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:34.520]   of the bullying equation,
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.900]   that it's kind of a foreign thing to me.
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:39.520]   It also makes me realize, and especially now
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:42.640]   after what you just said, that while I was in high school,
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.160]   I'm guessing there was a lot of bullying going around.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:45.420]   - I'm sure you might've witnessed it.
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:47.320]   - And I missed it.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:48.160]   - Yeah.
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:50.320]   - You know, I had some friends that could definitely
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.040]   be classified as misfits.
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:52.880]   - Yeah.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.440]   - And I think looking back, they hung out
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.880]   with my group of friends because we were definitely,
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:59.200]   we were into different things.
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.780]   We weren't, we, you know, me, meaning my peers grew up
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:05.260]   in the John Hughes film era where you had like the jocks
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:07.580]   versus the hippies versus the skateboarders
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:08.420]   versus the-
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:09.240]   - The burnouts.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:10.900]   And, you know, and I had my crowd
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:13.000]   and was friends with a number of people outside that crowd,
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.240]   but there were these kids that would hang around us
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:19.800]   that weren't into the same things that we were.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:22.480]   And I am looking back and realizing now that they did it
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:24.840]   because they were definitely safe with us.
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:25.680]   - Yeah.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:26.520]   - And-
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:27.360]   - Well, that's your fundamental-
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:28.760]   - We could be a little scary if we wanted to be,
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:31.040]   but we weren't the type to go out and be scary.
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:33.920]   So we, I think they must've sent some safety with us.
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.800]   And I actually have very fond memories of those kids
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.440]   and know some of them still now.
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:41.400]   So yeah, I asked that way in part
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:44.320]   because I realized I missed a lot.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.320]   Well, Lord knows I missed a lot of what was going on
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:47.440]   in high school for other reasons,
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:49.360]   but I just missed a lot of this.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:54.680]   And I think in, even in academic culture as an adult,
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:58.620]   I, not now, but I certainly witnessed bullying at meetings,
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:00.760]   more that was more demonstrative
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:05.600]   where people would make fun of people in general
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:09.080]   in a way that I felt suppressed the likelihood
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:10.400]   that people would ask questions,
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:11.760]   which is a kind of different form
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:14.240]   of posturing and bullying, right?
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:15.080]   - 100%.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.120]   - It makes students afraid to raise their hand
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:20.280]   and ask questions at meetings, for instance.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:21.400]   - It's intimidation.
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:22.600]   - Right, intimidation.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.840]   - And I experienced that too.
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:25.720]   I remember when I was younger in my career,
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:27.320]   I was giving a speech and people were like,
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:30.360]   "Oh, he does the field research, you know, like in school,
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.520]   that's soft science."
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:35.640]   And I was very, very fortunate and I was hurt by it
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.260]   'cause it's like, by the way, like doing your, you know,
[02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:40.320]   experiment in the laboratory with your sophomores
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:43.160]   in college is a lot easier than trying to randomize
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:45.600]   60 schools in Brooklyn and Queens, New York,
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:47.640]   and try to find effects of your program.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:49.920]   It's hard research, really difficult.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:51.720]   - Even just working on humans is hard.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.700]   For those of us that have worked on both animal models,
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:56.600]   which I no longer do, and humans, which I've done and do,
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:00.880]   working on humans is that much harder
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:02.360]   for all sorts of reasons.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.640]   They're not on the same genetic background.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.520]   You can't just put them in their cage, take them out,
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:08.480]   the same like, different like dark cycles.
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:10.440]   Some slept well, some didn't sleep well.
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.640]   I mean, there are issues with animal work as well,
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.280]   but yeah, just even embracing human research at all
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:17.560]   is an immense challenge.
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:20.960]   So the idea that it would be viewed as soft is,
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:23.800]   I mean, that's just like laughable to me, but.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:27.480]   - Exactly, but I was very fortunate that
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.120]   there was a professor, a very senior professor,
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:31.160]   his name was Ed Ziegler.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:34.840]   He was one of the co-founders of Head Start.
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.880]   And he was like my, he became my adult Uncle Marvin.
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:41.560]   And I'm giving this speech and all his people
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:45.400]   are like trying to like, really like demolish,
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:47.520]   you know, the presentation and my research.
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:49.760]   And he was revered 'cause he was like
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:51.320]   this famous developmental psychologist.
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:53.440]   And he just stood up and he's like, he slams the table,
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.520]   and he's like, I like this research.
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:58.240]   And I love you.
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.880]   Because like, I needed you to stand up for me
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.480]   'cause I'm like the stupid, not the stupid,
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:03.920]   I'm like the little postdoc here, right?
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:05.600]   Like I need support.
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:10.040]   And so, you know, my argument is that
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:12.560]   it's a human right to be protected, right?
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.000]   Now, I could protect myself now, right?
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.320]   Of course I can.
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:19.320]   But I'll have to, I'll give you another example of this.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:21.920]   Gosh, this is a really tough one for me.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.560]   I would say eight years ago,
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:28.720]   I was giving a speech at our university
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:31.040]   to a bunch of funders.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:35.080]   And it was me and another professor who I will not name,
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:38.680]   who is bigger than I am and bigger personality than I am
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:40.720]   and has a kind of rough reputation
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:42.560]   of being kind of a bully.
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:43.800]   I went on first.
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:46.520]   Now, granted, I'm a pretty good presenter.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:50.640]   And he was going on after.
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.680]   And I just, thank you, I went to the side.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:54.680]   He gets on.
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:56.680]   Now, I actually did a presentation on bullying.
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:58.880]   That's why I'm thinking about it.
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.600]   All right, I get off stage.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:02.680]   I'm sitting, you know, like everybody else.
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.200]   He gets on stage and changes his presentation
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:10.200]   and shows a video of a kid being horrifically bullied,
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.360]   which has nothing to do with his research.
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.640]   And I'm thinking, what the hell's going on here?
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.280]   And he plays a video.
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:19.800]   He's like doing that, like laughing to himself.
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.680]   And he's like, you know, I just wanted to let people know
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:24.000]   that was Mark before he got his black belt.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.640]   And I'm like--
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:27.520]   - What a dick.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:29.000]   - Yeah, it was not cool.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.520]   And I felt like, firstly, what was really interesting to me
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.320]   as a psychologist is that in that moment,
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:36.920]   I regressed to 10 years old.
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.920]   It was psychologically, all the memories of all the feelings
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.440]   and the bodily reactions, I was like, boom.
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:47.080]   And then, you know, luckily, you know,
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.400]   I do have a fifth degree black belt.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:49.960]   Luckily, I have a PhD in psychology.
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:51.240]   Luckily, I've had 10 years of therapy
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:53.800]   and I've been teaching emotional intelligence for 25 years.
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:58.720]   I'm like, Mark, you're 50, you've got a black belt.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:01.280]   Like, it took me a lot to recover.
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:02.320]   And I had to make a choice
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:05.560]   'cause like I'm still intimidated by that.
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.560]   And it makes me sad to even admit it
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:11.840]   because I don't like that I'm at this place in my life
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.120]   where I still can be intimidated by the bullies,
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:18.080]   but it's how I feel and I have to just accept that.
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:24.080]   And I decided, though, in that presentation was like,
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:27.680]   Mark, like, you gotta say something.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:30.400]   You're gonna prove to yourself that you can do it.
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:34.040]   And so after he was over, you know, I waited a little while
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:36.400]   and I just went up to him and I said, you know,
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.400]   I have no idea what motivated you to show that video,
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:43.880]   but number one, it was not cool.
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:47.160]   And number two, it can never happen again, never.
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:50.060]   And I can cry now thinking about it
[02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:53.080]   'cause it was very difficult for me, even as an adult.
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:56.560]   And of course then I ran away, I didn't run away,
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:59.480]   but I, you know, I took my breaths.
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.060]   I felt proud, you know, that I was able to handle myself,
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:05.320]   which, you know, may sound strange to some people,
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:08.280]   you know, being an adult who's a psychologist, you know,
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:09.400]   who has a fifth degree black belt,
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:12.200]   I have to reinforce that now to make myself feel strong.
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:17.200]   But it was such a powerful, it was a great moment for me,
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:21.280]   one, of like having the courage to face the bully.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:27.840]   And interestingly enough, the guy never,
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:31.480]   he was, he turned his, he treated me like I was like
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:33.880]   the president of the university after that.
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:38.880]   And so my point of telling that story is that,
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:44.160]   like I was 50, like that's old to cultivate the skills
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:48.360]   that I needed, right, to be able to deal
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:50.800]   with that very difficult situation.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:55.080]   And my dream is that, you know, I always, you know,
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:58.320]   I say, I tell people, I'm so envious of that kindergartner
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:02.680]   because I've been lucky enough to be the developer
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:04.980]   of the curriculum, but I didn't live it.
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.560]   And so it, talking about neuroscience, like I'm not wired
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.240]   like that five-year-old is gonna be wired
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:14.480]   because they're growing up in an environment
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:17.200]   where every day they're checking in on their feelings.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:18.640]   It reminds me of just another story.
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:22.520]   I was in a school in Brooklyn and I mean, kids,
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:25.400]   this one school has been using our program for a decade
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:28.520]   and they wanted, the kids wanted to meet me.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:32.200]   And the principal of the school, who's my former student,
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:34.240]   he said, you can ask Mark anything.
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:36.860]   And it's like, why do you do this and what motivates you?
[02:22:36.860 --> 02:22:40.680]   And I was telling these kids the story of my childhood.
[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:43.640]   And this one girl, she must've been in sixth grade.
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:47.000]   She said, I mean, it's really hard for me
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.040]   to understand your experience.
[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:50.680]   I said, why?
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:52.040]   She's like, I've been going to this school
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:55.800]   since I'm in kindergarten and I can't think of a day
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:58.120]   that someone didn't ask me how I was feeling.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:22:59.640]   It's powerful.
[02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:03.120]   You know, when you think about like her neural development,
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:05.280]   right, all the pathways that are being built
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:08.320]   for this person or these children in thousands of schools
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.360]   to be learning their feelings,
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:11.880]   understanding where they're, you know,
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:13.240]   why they're feeling the way they're feeling,
[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:16.640]   to interact with other kids and see how they're feeling
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:18.000]   and how they express their feelings
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.240]   and how they deal with their feelings
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:21.200]   and learning strategies together
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:23.720]   in a cooperative environment to cultivate
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:26.000]   and how that gets more complex with development, right?
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:26.840]   'Cause in kindergarten,
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:29.760]   you're learning about sadness and disappointment,
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:31.240]   but then you're learning about despair
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:33.720]   and alienation and exclusion.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:37.000]   And that's what makes this work so interesting
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.560]   is that these concepts evolve throughout our lives, right?
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:42.400]   Think about it.
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:45.160]   I mean, what anger meant to me when I was five
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:47.720]   is not what it meant to me when I was 10 or 15 or 25
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:48.800]   or now 55.
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:54.200]   - Your description of confronting this bully,
[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:55.800]   I don't even want to call them your colleague
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:57.280]   because there's nothing collegial about that.
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:58.120]   - I agree.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.720]   I thought it was an embarrassment for the university.
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:01.560]   But more importantly,
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:03.360]   the fact that you were able to confront them
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:07.360]   is to me and I think to anybody that hears that story,
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.400]   the definition of courage.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:10.360]   - Yeah.
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:13.120]   - Because it's in the moments where we feel like this big
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:14.840]   and we're collapsed on ourselves
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:18.720]   and we don't know where the resources are
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:20.200]   and we don't have somebody sitting there
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:21.800]   like holding our shoulder saying,
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:23.000]   "Listen, I'm going to go talk to them,"
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:23.960]   or "Let's go talk to them,"
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:26.440]   that you did that for yourself.
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:31.160]   You internalized the lessons you'd learned
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:33.680]   initially from your uncle.
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:34.600]   - Yeah.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:35.640]   - And brought that forward.
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:38.880]   And I think anyone hearing that story,
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:43.880]   it's obvious to them that that is a great act of courage.
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:46.160]   And it's an inspirational one too.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.760]   And a reminder that for people that are being bullied
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:50.840]   as adults as well,
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:53.300]   that it's important to calmly,
[02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:55.720]   but directly and firmly express,
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:58.760]   like you basically gave him a no,
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:00.280]   like a really strong, like no,
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:01.280]   like you would to a puppy
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:03.480]   that was like putting itself in danger or something,
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:04.600]   except in this case,
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:06.480]   it's a human being who had agency.
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:08.200]   And so he needed a sharp,
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:11.280]   he needed to be punished slightly.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.440]   - Yeah, he needed to be educated about boundaries
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:20.440]   and about how this game of being a colleague is played.
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:21.920]   - Well, certainly not rewarded.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:23.320]   You're right, punished isn't the right word.
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:27.920]   He certainly, whatever dopamine hit he got from that.
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:28.760]   - I think part of it-
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.480]   - That antic was just needed,
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:31.880]   that needed to be retracted.
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:33.480]   That needed to be taken away from him.
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:35.680]   - Yeah, and I think that we should spend a minute
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:38.400]   on punishment because it never works.
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:40.080]   You know, unless it's consistent, harsh,
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:41.560]   and nobody wants to be punished
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:42.880]   because it doesn't feel good
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.460]   and it doesn't teach people anything, right?
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:46.960]   Go to your room.
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:47.800]   What does that teach me?
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:51.080]   It teach me to go to my room and ruminate and get angrier.
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:54.400]   I've been in schools that are not using our model.
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.280]   You know, I'll never forget this one moment
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:57.920]   where I was in a principal's office,
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:00.760]   a kid had given the teacher the finger
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:03.880]   and he got thrown to the office and it was a Tuesday.
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.960]   And it was Tuesday before,
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:10.520]   the next week was going to be a holiday break.
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:14.880]   And the, you know, you got, it was a two day suspension,
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:17.360]   you know, for giving the teacher the finger,
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.880]   but that was going to be till Thursday.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:21.240]   And then Friday, you know,
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:22.660]   after that there'd be a week break.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:24.760]   And I literally heard the principal say,
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:25.800]   let's just make it three days
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:28.160]   so I wouldn't have to see this kid for 10 days.
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:31.080]   And I'm thinking,
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.460]   what is this person learning about empathy,
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:38.920]   about self-regulation, about emotional awareness?
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:40.560]   They're learning nothing.
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:43.840]   They're going to be thrown out with no skills
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:46.960]   in an environment that's probably not supportive.
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:50.720]   And so I just think this has to change
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:53.440]   and it still does happen, not as often, thank goodness.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:56.080]   I'm a prevention scientist.
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:58.520]   So I don't want to wait until everyone
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:01.280]   has an anxiety disorder and everyone's been bullied.
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:03.800]   I want to cultivate a society where people have the skills
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:05.660]   they need to navigate their emotions
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:08.200]   and know how to build healthy relationships
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:10.400]   and make sound decisions and have good mental health
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:11.660]   and achieve their dreams.
[02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:15.720]   - And it occurred to me just now
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:20.720]   that you're effectively doing what your uncle did for you,
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:24.560]   but for millions and millions of people.
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:26.840]   - You know, God bless Uncle Marvin.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:30.680]   I have a, you know, as you know now, the storyteller,
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:33.840]   but one of the most profound moments of my career
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:35.760]   was just after I had written my book
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:37.840]   and I was on my book tour.
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:41.600]   I'm in Westchester, New York, and I'm giving a speech.
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:43.360]   And I had never spoken about my uncle
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.960]   in that level of detail, nor my abuse, by the way.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.800]   I was talking about courage.
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:48.640]   It was not until 48, writing this book,
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:50.600]   that I decided, like, people ask me, like,
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:52.360]   why are you so passionate?
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:54.200]   And I would say I hated school, I was bullied,
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.120]   but I believe I was robbed of my emotional life as a child
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:02.240]   because of the abuse and, you know, my circumstances.
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:04.560]   And I felt I needed to just share that a little bit.
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.320]   Not the focus, but I needed to be, I needed to be real.
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.880]   So I'm sharing about Uncle Marvin, the sixth grade teacher
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.640]   from Monticello, New York State.
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:15.080]   And this guy has this, like,
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:16.680]   like that woman in the audience, he had an epiphany.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:18.040]   He's like, are you talking about Marvin Moore,
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:19.200]   the sixth grade social studies teacher
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:20.040]   from Monticello, New York?
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:20.880]   I'm like, yes.
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:22.960]   He's like, Mark, you're not gonna believe this,
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.320]   but your Uncle Marvin was my Uncle Marvin.
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:26.920]   I'm like, are you kidding me?
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:30.640]   He's like, your uncle was my sixth grade teacher
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.000]   45 years ago, and he's the reason why I teach.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:35.840]   I was blown away.
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:38.160]   I was like, I was like, I was shaking so excited
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:40.840]   that I never met one of my uncle's actual students.
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.880]   'Cause, you know, we worked when I was older.
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:44.320]   He was older.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:47.600]   And so I said to the guy, I gotta finish my speech,
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:50.200]   but can I interview you afterwards?
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:51.040]   He's like, yeah.
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:54.880]   So I interviewed this guy, I have it on tape.
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:56.720]   45 minutes, what he remembered
[02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:59.000]   about his sixth grade social studies class.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.200]   I mean, I have no memories of my social studies class.
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.760]   This guy remembered details of my uncle's facial expression,
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:07.720]   body language, the way he taught feelings,
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:08.720]   the way he taught history.
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.040]   It was on and on and on.
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:12.200]   But here's the kicker.
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:16.440]   So we're done with this conversation,
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:18.280]   and he looks at me and he's like, you know,
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:20.440]   Mark, it's really clear
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:25.360]   that your uncle had a profound influence on your life.
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.360]   And so I just have one question for you.
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:33.520]   For whom were you an Uncle Marvin?
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:38.400]   And it just like, oh, like, I'm the professor here.
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:39.920]   I'm the one who does the teaching, right?
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:40.760]   I do the research.
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:43.160]   You don't ask me questions like that.
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.440]   And it was so eye-opening for me about just, you know,
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:50.480]   my life in terms of how I spend my time with my own family.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:54.960]   And am I giving that non-judgment?
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:56.560]   Am I giving that active listening?
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:58.160]   Am I showing my empathy and compassion?
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:01.280]   I'm like, I'm a workaholic, you know, I write papers.
[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:02.920]   I'm not living it.
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:06.000]   And it really has made a profound difference for me.
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.480]   You know, I really try hard
[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:14.480]   to be an Uncle Marvin and it's tough 'cause time, right?
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:17.480]   All the factors that we talked about earlier,
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:19.400]   but gosh, you know,
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:21.960]   if we only had more of those in our world.
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:24.120]   - Well, it's absolutely clear to me
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:29.120]   that you're extremely passionate about this mission
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:32.080]   of teaching people what emotions are
[02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:33.960]   and how to work with them,
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:38.640]   giving them really clear systems to do that,
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:40.400]   tools that they can do that.
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:43.200]   And I think it's fair to say
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:47.800]   that you answered your own question, in my opinion,
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:52.080]   if I may, that, you know, you,
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:54.160]   through your Uncle Marvin to you
[02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:55.480]   and through the work that you do
[02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:57.880]   and through your public education effort,
[02:30:57.880 --> 02:30:59.840]   which includes your graciousness in coming here
[02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:03.320]   and sharing with us what you know,
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:04.800]   what you believe people can benefit from.
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:06.640]   And it's absolutely clear to me
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:09.360]   that people can so benefit from these tools
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.400]   and what you put into your book,
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:12.320]   which does include some very personal things
[02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:16.480]   that I must say are entirely couched
[02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:19.320]   toward the reader understanding
[02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:21.720]   and learning how they can make themselves
[02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:23.880]   and others and the world a better place.
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:25.800]   It's really extraordinary.
[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:26.720]   - I appreciate that.
[02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:29.880]   - The rippling out effect
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.760]   is not a sufficient way to describe it.
[02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:36.080]   It's really an enormous amplification
[02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:38.000]   of the hard work you've done.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:42.320]   And I'm just really, really in awe
[02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:45.200]   of the fact that you've taken hard experiences
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:48.800]   and transmuted those into so much good.
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.480]   And so on behalf of myself
[02:31:50.480 --> 02:31:52.320]   and everyone listening and watching,
[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:54.560]   I just want to extend an enormous debt of gratitude.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:56.080]   This is truly important work.
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:57.680]   And I don't say that lightly.
[02:31:57.680 --> 02:31:58.720]   - I really appreciate that.
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:31:59.760]   Thank you.
[02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:01.640]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:03.160]   with Dr. Mark Brackett.
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:04.400]   To learn more about his work
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:06.840]   and to find links to his book, "Permission to Feel,"
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:08.960]   which by the way, I highly recommend,
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:11.440]   as well as other links to his laboratory
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:12.720]   and other resources,
[02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:15.040]   please see the links in the show note captions.
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:17.320]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:34.040]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:36.680]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:39.240]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:40.940]   or topics or guests you'd like me to consider
[02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:42.440]   for the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:44.860]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:46.600]   I do read all the comments.
[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:47.740]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:48.940]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.560]   It's my very first book.
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:51.960]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:54.120]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:32:54.120 --> 02:32:55.280]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:56.440]   for more than five years,
[02:32:56.440 --> 02:32:58.760]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:00.320]   of research and experience.
[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:03.380]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:33:03.380 --> 02:33:05.860]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:08.320]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:11.680]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:13.760]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:15.480]   The book is now available by pre-sale
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:17.660]   at protocolsbook.com.
[02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:20.040]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.800]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:33:21.800 --> 02:33:23.560]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:26.120]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:28.320]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.880]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:33.640]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:35.720]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:37.120]   And on all those platforms,
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:39.300]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:40.760]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.240]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:44.240]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:45.720]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:49.040]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:50.340]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:52.280]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:53.940]   the Neural Network newsletter
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:55.820]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:57.680]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:58.800]   as well as protocols
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:01.840]   in the form of brief one- to three-page PDFs,
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.040]   protocols that cover things
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:04.960]   like learning and neuroplasticity,
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:07.480]   how to optimize and regulate your dopamine,
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:08.920]   how to improve your sleep.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:11.400]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.600]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:15.760]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter,
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:16.820]   and provide your email.
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:17.660]   And I should point out
[02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:20.140]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:21.440]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:23.640]   for today's discussion all about emotions
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:25.120]   with Dr. Mark Brackett.
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:27.460]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:29.420]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:32.000]   (upbeat music)
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.580]   (upbeat music)
