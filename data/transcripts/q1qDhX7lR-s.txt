[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We read once more the verses 28, 29, and 30 in the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   to the Romans.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.960]   And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.760]   are the called according to his purpose.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.320]   Moreover whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.840]   of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.480]   justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.400]   Now we are at the moment looking at this great argument displayed before us here by the apostle.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.720]   It's a statement, perhaps the greatest of all of them, concerning the doctrine of the
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:08.040]   final perseverance of the saints, which means that those who once are born again can never
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.680]   finally fall away from grace or out of that position of relationship to God as his dear
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680]   children.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.920]   We've considered the verses that are generally brought forward in objection to this, and
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.760]   having done that, we began last Friday night in a general statement again of the doctrine
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.040]   and the inevitability of this doctrine in the light of scriptural teaching.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.680]   For instance, I try to show again how every single term that the apostle uses in this
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.880]   statement carries with it this necessary implication that this doctrine must be true, otherwise
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.400]   somehow or another God has been mistaken.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.600]   He should never have called us if he knew that finally we were going to fall away, and
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.640]   so on with all the other terms.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.600]   They involve a contradiction of the doctrine concerning God's omniscience and God's foreknowledge.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.800]   Secondly, we saw that what is said everywhere in the scriptures about believers carries
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.040]   also this same necessary implication.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.080]   For instance, here are some of the terms that we found.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.520]   We are told that we are saved in the life of Christ, that we are dead to sin, that we
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.240]   are dead to the law.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.560]   The new birth, in the same way, puts it positively, and still more, the great doctrine of our
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.040]   union with Christ, and particularly that statement on which we ended last Friday night when we
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.200]   reminded one another that the apostle tells the Ephesians that as Christians we are already
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.240]   seated in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.480]   And it's utterly inconceivable that we should ever be placed in that position if finally
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.600]   we are to spend our eternity in perdition and in hell.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.840]   Very well.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.760]   In other words, to sum up all that I've said, we can put it like this, that everything that
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.880]   we are told about the Christian, about the believer, carries with it this inevitable
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.240]   implication of the final perseverance of such people.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.040]   Now this has been stated, it seems to me, very clearly by our blessed Lord himself in
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.320]   a statement in John 5 verse 24, the fifth chapter of the gospel according to St. John,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.400]   chapter of verse 24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you."
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.480]   Now this is a grave statement, the "verily, verily, truly, truly, amen, amen," whichever
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.680]   way you translate it, it always calls attention to some statement of unusually profound significance
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   and importance.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.160]   Our Lord says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:25.440]   on him that sent me, hath," not he shall have, "has or hath everlasting life, and shall not
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.760]   come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life."
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.880]   I would have thought that that one verse should really be sufficient in and of itself.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.040]   We are told that he hath everlasting life, that he shall not come unto condemnation,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.240]   because he's got everlasting life.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:59.560]   But, this is a further reason for it, he shall not come into condemnation because he is passed
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.080]   from death unto life.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   Now this new English translation is really almost amusing in this verse.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.080]   At the first it puts it like this, "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.280]   sent me, has hold of eternal life."
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.080]   You see, they don't seem to be very sure at that point.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.680]   They don't say that he's got it, which is what the original says.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.600]   They say he's got hold of it.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.400]   That might give the impression, mightn't it, that he might lose his hold of it.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.440]   But then you see they go on to say this, that he shall not come into condemnation, and then
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   they become even stronger than the authorised translation.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.120]   They go on to say, "but has already passed."
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.240]   They introduce the word already, which is not in the original, making it even stronger
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   still.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.080]   It all comes to the same thing, "has already passed from death unto life."
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.640]   Well whichever translation you take, you see it comes to the same thing, and the statements
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.560]   are unequivocal.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.640]   They can only have one meaning, "he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:26.680]   everlasting life," he's already got it, "and shall not come into condemnation, but is,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.800]   has already passed from death unto life."
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.240]   Well we've already seen that in many statements which I adduced last Friday night, out of
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.920]   the sixth chapter, the beginning of the sixth chapter of this epistle to the Romans.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.200]   But there it is, in one verse, stated by our blessed Lord and Saviour himself.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   Very well, that really should be enough.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.800]   But, knowing the difficulty people get, and indeed the opposition of some people even
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.040]   to this doctrine, I want to bring yet further arguments.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.320]   So the third argument I put in this way.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.680]   It is an argument based upon the nature of the Church, the nature of the Christian Church.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.760]   Now what I mean is this.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.080]   Our great danger, most of us, is to think of this great salvation that we enjoy too
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.240]   much and too exclusively in individual terms.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.440]   The whole emphasis today is upon this individual aspect.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:38.140]   Now what they're concerned about is of course that we should be certain that we are saved,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.360]   that we are not content merely with believing about salvation in general, but that we should
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.000]   know that we ourselves are saved.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.240]   That's all right, that's perfectly right.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.840]   That is true and we must all make sure of that.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.200]   But of course the emphasis is almost exclusively on this side.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.680]   My decision, my taking Christ, my accepting the offer.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.960]   We've got to do that as I say.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.060]   But the impression is given that that is the one thing that matters.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:15.880]   And we tend to stop at that point and think of it solely in terms of our own individual
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.800]   possession of salvation.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.480]   Now what I'm saying is this, that while that is perfectly true, and we must all make sure
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:31.080]   of our position, that that is not the whole of truth.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:38.300]   We after all as individual Christians are parts of a whole.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.000]   Look at the way this apostle puts it in 1 Corinthians 12 27.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.360]   He says, "Ye are the body of Christ and members in particular."
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.400]   Yes, we are individual particular members, but you mustn't say that you're only individual
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.720]   particular members.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.400]   The great doctrine that is emphasized everywhere in the New Testament is, is the church as
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.120]   the body of Christ.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.800]   We as members of the church, we are not a loose collection of odd individuals, all of
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.560]   whom has this solely individual relationship to the Lord.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.380]   That's quite wrong.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:29.800]   We must think of ourselves as being members in particular of a body, which is a whole.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.340]   And it's very wrong of us to think of ourselves as Christians, except in terms of our belonging
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.920]   to this whole.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.900]   We have no separate individual existence.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.600]   We are all individual parts of a whole.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.060]   Now the analogy of course is a perfect one.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.220]   That's why the apostle uses it obviously.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   It's that of the body.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.000]   You see there's no sense or meaning in a finger in and of itself.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.660]   It's a part of a whole.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.660]   It's a part of a hand, and a hand is not something in and of itself.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.620]   It's a part, it's joined on to a forearm and arm and all the rest of it.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.340]   Now here is surely something which we are all tending to forget.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:22.260]   All this exclusively personal individual emphasis today can be most misleading, and it is misleading.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.160]   They therefore think that as they come in this individual manner to Christ, they can
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.180]   fall out of that individual relationship to Christ.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.400]   It's largely because they fail to remember the New Testament emphasis upon the church
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.100]   as a body, and that the individual aspect is only an aspect of the whole.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.180]   Not something in and of itself.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.120]   It's a part of the whole.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.020]   Never think of a part as something separate.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.880]   It's a part of a whole, always.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.260]   Now we'll see the importance of that in a moment.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.420]   Now the apostle of course says that more than once in that twelfth chapter of the first
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.660]   epistle to the Corinthians, take for instance the crucial statement here in the thirteenth
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.380]   verse of that chapter, for he says that we have all been baptized by one spirit into
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   one body.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.540]   That's what the Holy Spirit has done.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.540]   We are baptized by the Spirit into this one body of Christ.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.020]   Very well, there's another statement of it, but there are still further statements of
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:29.580]   this which I feel I must quote because of the tendency to forget this.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.780]   Take Ephesians 4.4 for instance.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:41.100]   There is one body and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.520]   See, there it is once more for us.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.420]   And of course he's already mentioned this at the end of the first chapter of the epistle
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.060]   to the Ephesians, where he says, "And hath put all things under his feet," God has put
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.740]   everything under the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ, "and gave him to be the head over
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.680]   all things to the church, which is his body."
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.220]   The fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:14.140]   And again in Ephesians 4.16, that great statement of it, "From whom the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:21.220]   whole body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.540]   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.820]   the edifying of itself in love."
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:36.160]   Christ is the head, he says in verse 15, and then "from whom the whole body."
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.600]   So that as you think of yourself as an individual Christian, be careful always to remember that
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.460]   you're not in isolation.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.180]   We are all a part of this body of Christ.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:54.320]   The church, the whole, is more than a mere summation of the parts, but we are parts of
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   the whole.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.160]   Now then, why is this so important?
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   Well for this reason, does it come to anybody here tonight I wonder as a surprise if I say
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:14.640]   this, that the Lord Jesus Christ has not so much died for us as individuals, but has died
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.520]   for his people.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.000]   That's where all this is so important.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.960]   Of course you've deduced that he has died for you as an individual.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.120]   Yes, but he only dies for you as an individual, because you belong to the people for whom
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   he has died as a whole.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.240]   Now then, let me substantiate my contention here.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.000]   I read that mighty 17th chapter of John's Gospel at the beginning, because there of
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.880]   course it's taught in almost every verse.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.680]   Let me pick out some of the more crucial statements of it, take the second verse.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:59.840]   As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.000]   as thou hast given him.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.480]   God has given him a people, and he has come to give eternal life to these people who have
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.160]   been given to him by God.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.400]   Take verse 6 then.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.200]   I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:27.520]   Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.560]   Pick out again verse 9.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.840]   I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   they are thine.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.280]   God has given him a people, and all he does, he does for these people.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.760]   Look at it again in verse 11.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.360]   Verse 10 of course is just an elaboration.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.200]   All mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.360]   And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.680]   And I come to thee.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:01.280]   Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.040]   one as we are.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.400]   Now you know this 17th chapter of John is a great chapter that's been appropriated by
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.760]   the so-called ecumenical movement today.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.640]   And of course they think this is the great statement of it.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.840]   It is the great statement of the ultimate unity, but not in the sense in which they
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.280]   use it.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.120]   This isn't just a coming together of everybody who call themselves Christian.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.160]   This is a unity that is like the unity between the Father and the Son.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.880]   That's the unity that our Lord speaks of in John 17.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.800]   That they may be one as we are.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.000]   And it's only in that sense that we are to be one.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.920]   Verse 12, while I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name, those that thou gavest
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   me.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   You see, God has given him a people.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.400]   And our Lord came into the world to do what he did for these people who were given to
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.960]   him by God.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.720]   He keeps on saying it.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.800]   And none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.880]   That was prophesied, that was known.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.940]   He was never really one of them at all.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:16.000]   So that this is a reference, of course, to Judas Iscariot.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.040]   Then you get that same idea going on.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.640]   But let me hurry on to verse 19 so that I don't read the whole chapter again.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:29.440]   And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   truth.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.920]   Neither pray I for these alone.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.760]   In other words, lest somebody think that he's only speaking these things of the disciples.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.800]   He was speaking it of them primarily, but he says it's not only true of them, but for
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.940]   them also which shall believe on me through their word.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.360]   And that comes right down to us today.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.760]   That they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee, that they also may be
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.720]   one in us.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.600]   That's the union.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.360]   It's the union of these people.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.960]   Their union with Christ and his union with the Father.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.660]   That's the only unity that's talked about in John 17.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.120]   It's not a mere union of organizations or of denominations.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:18.560]   It is an essentially spiritual union of the deepest type that we can conceive of.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.000]   But let's go on.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.560]   Verse 22, and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.680]   even as we are one.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.440]   There's nothing higher than that.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.520]   The unity between the Father and the Son is the unity between those of us who are members
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.340]   of his body and are all joined to him as the living head.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:53.480]   On he goes, I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:18:02.400]   world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:08.880]   God's love to us as Christians is the same as his love to his own Son.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.240]   If his love to us can somehow be frustrated, well then his love to the Son can be frustrated
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.240]   in the same way.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.640]   The thing is impossible.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.560]   It's just a monstrous suggestion.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   These are his own words.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:32.040]   Verse 24, Father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:39.280]   they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.120]   of the world.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:47.600]   Now the whole of that chapter as you see makes this doctrine quite inevitable.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.000]   But the thing I'm emphasizing at the moment is this.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.960]   That the big point made by our Lord is that all he came into the world to do he came to
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   do for these people whom God had given him.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.800]   He doesn't pray for the world, he prays for these only.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.520]   These are the people, the one whom God has given him.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.400]   And I therefore say that he died for them and that all he does he does for them.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.240]   Now let's again notice the Apostle Paul putting this same point.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:26.800]   My statement is, my argument is, that we mustn't so much say that the Lord Jesus Christ died
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.840]   for us as separate individuals.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:37.000]   He died for these people whom God gave him before the foundation of the world.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.200]   Who are these?
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.880]   These are the church.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:47.640]   So that you see when you come to Ephesians 5 and begin to read at verse 25 this is what
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.200]   you get.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   "Love your husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   for it."
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:09.600]   Now that's if you like a similar kind of statement which the Apostle made in saying his farewell
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.840]   to the elders at Ephesus as recorded in Acts 20.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.280]   Where he says referring to the church which he purchased with his own blood.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.040]   It's the same notion.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.800]   Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:34.260]   He died for the church and he only died for us individually as we are a part of the church.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.560]   So you see the Apostle goes on to say things like this.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.680]   He gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.160]   the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.520]   or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.040]   He's talking about the church the whole time not about a collection of individuals but
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:04.640]   about the church as the bride his own bride that he's preparing for himself and thus he
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.920]   perfects her that he may present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.680]   or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.920]   So men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.840]   Now here's an extraordinary argument he that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   How can that be?
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.960]   How is it true to say that a man who loves his wife is thereby loving himself?
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.440]   Well here's his answer no man he says ever yet hated his own flesh.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:44.800]   So a man's wife is his own flesh but he nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord does the
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:52.280]   church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:58.280]   We're in that intimate relationship we're not holding on to or hanging on to or loosely
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.560]   attached we're a part of him.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   We are a part of his body.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.640]   It's a difficult argument this is a great mystery he goes on to say but you see that's
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.960]   how he works it out we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones then back
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.060]   to the analogy of marriage for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:25.400]   shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:31.160]   Glorious doctrine about marriage yes but this is a great mystery but I speak concerning
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:38.200]   Christ and the church that's the relationship between Christ and the church one flesh members
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.840]   of his body of his flesh and of his bones.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:51.800]   Very well here's the teaching you see he died for this people given to him that's the church
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:23:00.520]   and he died for the church and nothing that belongs to the church can therefore be lost.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.160]   The intimate relationship is such that it's something which is quite impossible.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.040]   Now it does seem to me that if we only grasp this idea and cease to think of our salvation
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.560]   in that kind of atomistic manner it'll not only help us to understand this doctrine it'll
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.400]   save us from a lot of trouble in many many respects.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:31.800]   He came to do all he did for this people that God gave him Christ died for the church the
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:39.840]   full the complete church he died to redeem that church and to perfect it and represent
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.840]   it to himself and it will be absolutely perfect there won't be a part missing it won't be
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.880]   minus a finger or minus a foot it'll be perfect and entire a complete whole without spot or
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.920]   wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.000]   That's the that's the argument and it of course makes the doctrine of the final perseverance
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.240]   of the Saints quite inevitable if any of us can fall off the church will no longer be
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:12.040]   perfect it'll be a mutilated truncated church minus various parts and portions.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:18.720]   The thing is quite inconceivable it is quite impossible in the light of this great doctrine.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:26.040]   Now I say let's get hold of this glorious New Testament doctrine of the church and put
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.400]   less emphasis upon the individual aspect I don't even like to put it like that these
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:38.840]   things should not be in competition but it is this fatal tendency to count heads and
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.880]   to be interested in numbers that causes the whole confusion.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:50.240]   Let's remember that Christ died for the church he's come to give eternal life to as many
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.480]   as God had given him before the foundation of the world.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.400]   Very well we leave that there and go on to what is then our fourth argument that was
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.560]   the third because I'd given the two previous ones you remember last Friday night.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:14.160]   So the fourth argument I am developing is this one that this again is entirely confirmed
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.480]   by the teaching in the scriptures concerning chastisement.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:27.080]   Now here again is a doctrine which is stated with particular clarity at certain points
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.840]   and the first I go to is 1 Corinthians 11 the teaching concerning how we should come
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.160]   to the Lord's table and to partake of the Lord's supper.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:45.960]   1 Corinthians 11 27 to the end wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.320]   the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.000]   Let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.520]   that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:04.800]   Authorized is Paul here it's got damnation it should be judgment eateth and drinketh
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.720]   damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause here it is many are weak
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.600]   and sickly among you and many sleep because they haven't examined themselves and come
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:23.800]   in the right way he says that many are weak physically weak many are ill sick sickly among
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:30.240]   you and some have even died many sleep for if we would judge ourselves he says in this
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.560]   way we should not be judged.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:40.560]   Now listen to this but when we are judged in this way by God afflicting us with weakness
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:48.440]   or sickness or illness or even death but when we are judged what is it well it means that
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:55.040]   we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world he does this
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.520]   to us in order that we may not be condemned with the world in other words he does this
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.400]   to his own people because they are his own people and are not involved in the condemnation
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   of the world.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:13.720]   Very well there is the argument as it's put there and especially notice that 32nd
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:20.360]   verse which is the vital one at that point well now let's turn to Hebrews 12 where of
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:28.040]   course we've got this again in a very notable passage in verses 5 to 11 of Hebrews 12 some
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:34.000]   of the verses are particularly important he says you have forgotten the exhortation which
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.400]   speaketh unto you as unto children saying my son my son you see that's the emphasis
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:48.920]   my son remember that you are my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:58.200]   when thou art rebuked of him why not well for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:06.760]   scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God what he means by enduring
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.360]   chastening is this he says if you are being subject to chastening if you are now having
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.400]   a very difficult time and are enduring or suffering or having to put up with if you
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:24.840]   like the chastening of the Lord God is dealing with you as with sons for what son is he whom
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:31.960]   the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers all
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:39.400]   meaning obviously all sons if you be without chastisement if you're not being chastised
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:46.560]   this thing which happens to all who are partakers are sons then are you bastards and not sons
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.480]   in other words the argument is that if you're not receiving the chastisement you're not
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.520]   a child of God at all you're a bastard you think you're a child of God but you're not
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:02.240]   and you never have been you're a bastard and not really a son perfectly clear argument
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:09.480]   isn't it furthermore he says you have had we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.680]   us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more rather be in subjection unto the
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.040]   father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:29.080]   pleasure but he for our profit that in order that we might be partakers of his holiness
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:36.680]   that's why he does it it is a part of his process of preparing his children for the
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:47.480]   glory which he has prepared for them in other words the argument from chastisement is this
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:53.200]   that because we are chastised it is proved positive that we are children because we wouldn't
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.680]   be chastised if we were bastards it's a proof therefore that we are children and God chastises
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:05.640]   his children because he's preparing them for that sharing of his eternal holiness with
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:15.360]   him so that we argue like this you see that the very employment of chastisement is a proof
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.840]   for the final perseverance of the Saints because it is the way in which God does enable them
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   to persevere if you like compels them to persevere he doesn't leave us alone because we are his
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.800]   children because we are his children he's going to do this that and the other to us
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   until he brings us to that place which he has originally designed for us which is the
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:46.920]   conformity again to the image of his dear son so it's a most important argument now
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:56.280]   I think I can illustrate this to you in this way take that reference to Judas in that 17th
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:07.600]   chapter of John's Gospel the son of perdition contrast the dealing with Judas and the dealing
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:17.200]   with the Apostle Peter now the Apostle Peter denied his Lord he denied him three times
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:23.960]   he denied him with oaths and cursing there's nothing to be said in defense of Peter it
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:31.840]   was cowardly it was dastardly it was everything that was wrong Peter deliberately denied his
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:38.560]   Lord in order to save his life but you notice the extraordinary difference in the treatment
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   of the two our Lord prepared Peter for it beforehand you'll find the thing described
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.320]   in the in in the 12th chapter of the gospel according to St. Luke there it is dealt with
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:32:03.680]   most fully let me just remind you of what we read there because our Lord as I say puts
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:12.440]   it there in a particularly clear manner he says to Peter that he knows exactly what he's
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:20.000]   going to do and what how he is going to deny him and so on but he gives him this great
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:33.720]   assurance I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not now you see he takes care of
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.920]   Peter he knows Peter's weakness he knows what's going to happen to him he knows that he is
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:47.200]   going to deny him but nevertheless he says I'm going to pray for you that your faith
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:56.480]   may fail not and after thou art converted strengthen thy brother I'm wrong in saying
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:07.400]   Luke 12 of course it's Luke 22 Luke 22 and especially the verses beginning at verse 31
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:14.120]   and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan of desire to have you that he may sift you
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.600]   as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:26.880]   strengthen thy brother Peter then foolishly says Lord I am ready to go with thee both
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:32.120]   into prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the cock shall not crow this day
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:40.600]   before thou shalt Christ deny that thou knowest me now you see the whole explanation is this
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.840]   so Lord knows what Judas and Peter are going to do but he doesn't say anything like this
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:51.960]   to Judas he doesn't care for Judas Judas is allowed to go his own way he's the son of
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:57.400]   perdition he's never really belonged Peter does and because of that he prays for him
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:03.240]   he's caring for him and he assures him even before he is fallen that he's going to be
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:09.480]   restored and tells him to strengthen his brethren after he has been restored Peter doesn't understand
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   it you see thank God it doesn't depend upon our understanding it depends upon the fact
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:23.880]   that he's holding on to us that he's praying we are held by him and not by what we do otherwise
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:34.080]   we would all beyond any question be lost irretrievably and let me finally end this particular section
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.680]   by reading a very good statement of this whole doctrine this aspect of chastisement from
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:52.840]   Psalm 89 in which there's a very clear statement Psalm 89 verses 31 to 34 if they break my
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:35:02.160]   statutes and keep not my commandments then will I visit their transgression with the
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:12.120]   rob and their iniquity with stripes nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:23.000]   from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail my covenant will I not break nor alter the
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.360]   thing that is gone out of my lips once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:39.760]   unto David his seed shall endure forever and his throne as the Sun before me it shall be
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:46.080]   established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven now here it is you see I
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:52.200]   will visit their transgression with the rock and their iniquity with stripes that's just
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.720]   isn't that's punishment and it can be very severe the teaching there in 1 Corinthians
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:03.600]   11 beyond any question is that there were some Christian people who had died because
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   of their lack of faithfulness but though they're dead they're not lost that's the distinction
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.160]   they're dead they've gone out of this life but they're not lost even their death in a
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:23.240]   sense is a part of the chastisement that ultimately saves the soul and here he says nevertheless
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.720]   my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:34.920]   my covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips and as I
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   think I've already reminded you on a previous occasion the whole doctrine of handing over
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.840]   to Satan is a proof of the same thing he's handed over to Satan that the flesh might
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.760]   be dealt with and corrected in order that the soul may not be saved in other words the
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:02.400]   whole teaching concerning chastisement seems to me to teach perfectly plainly and clearly
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.840]   this doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints it is one of the ways by which
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:15.660]   God preserves his people and perfects them and prepares them for that final glory which
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:22.200]   he has already predestined for them in the Lord Jesus Christ and one other argument this
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:30.400]   evening it's the argument from the doctrine of the remnant let me put this to you before
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:38.800]   I close there is very clearly taught in the scriptures this great doctrine of the remnant
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.000]   now then let me give you some of the statements it's particularly taught in this very epistle
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:54.720]   to the Romans with which we are dealing now here it is in Romans 9 verse 29 which is a
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:08.440]   quotation from Isaiah 1 9 but let me read it in Romans 9 29 and as Isaiah said before
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:17.880]   except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed we had been a Sodom and been made like unto
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:26.720]   Gomorrah what it means you see is this if the Lord of Sabaoth himself had not left us
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:37.600]   a seed we'd have all gone Isaiah 1 is a description of the terrible fall and failure and sin of
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:44.040]   the nation of Israel they had left you remember we are told like that cucumber tent as it
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:50.640]   were in the vineyard everything has gone but just that and here it is quite plainly stated
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:59.160]   by the prophet and the apostle quotes it if the Lord of Sabaoth himself had not left which
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:08.720]   means preserved a seed we had been a Sodom and had been made like unto Gomorrah it's
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.000]   the Lord of Sabaoth who preserves the remnant the remnant doesn't preserve itself let's
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.120]   go on then and see how he puts it the same thing in chapter 11 in the first six verses
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:33.200]   I say that hath God cast away his people see the problem is this here is the vast majority
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:41.760]   of the Jewish nation rejecting Christ crucify their own Messiah the vast majority so the
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:48.760]   question arises as these are the people of God hath God cast away his people God forbid
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:55.960]   answers the apostle for I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abram of the tribe of Benjamin
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:02.400]   God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew what he not with the scripture saith
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:09.080]   of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:16.520]   thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:25.080]   set the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:36.840]   knee to the image of Baal even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:44.160]   according to the election of grace and if by grace then it is no more of works otherwise
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.680]   grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:57.800]   no more work what it means you see is this poor Elijah thought he was the only one left
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:03.240]   and what God said to him is this you're wrong you know you're not alone you're not the only
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:12.400]   one left who's true to the cause I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   knee to the image of Baal he doesn't say look here there are another 7,000 who are holding
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.880]   on and who are not falling away with the rest wonderful people they are they're holding
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:29.240]   on their faith is still keeping them and holding them they haven't fallen away they haven't
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:37.760]   gone back they're holding on not at all I have reserved to myself and then to put it
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.000]   still more plainly even so he says now he says I'm one of them don't say that God hath
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.560]   forsaken or cast off his people I'm an Israelite I'm one says Paul but I'm not the only one
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:56.920]   thank God even so at this present time there is also a remnant well what's what accounts
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:04.240]   for this remnant in Israel oh it's a remnant according to the election the choice of grace
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:11.680]   it's God he says as a reserved 7,000 in addition to Elijah in that ancient time he is reserving
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.000]   to himself even now with things as they are even now a remnant for himself according to
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.120]   the election of grace and then in order to make quite sure that we are clear that you
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:30.680]   mustn't give the glory to these Jews who decided to believe he says look here if it's of grace
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:39.240]   it's no more of works it isn't their works it isn't even their believing it's grace and
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.520]   if it's grace then it's no more of works otherwise grace is no more of grace is no more grace
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.120]   but if it be a works well then it's no more grace it's got to be one or the other and
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   it isn't works he says it's nothing in them it's all of grace it's all of God it's all
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:43:02.320]   of the election it's God reserving unto himself these people there's a remnant in Israel now
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:10.120]   then there is the argument and take with that this what he's already said in Romans 9 verses
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:16.520]   6 and 7 which is again you see another definition of the remnant if you like not as though the
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:23.360]   word of God hath taken none effect don't you say he says because the whole bulk of the
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   nation of Israel seems to be in unbelief don't you say then that all that God did in the
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.520]   Old Testament has been a waste of time is a frustrated effort and it's come to nothing
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:41.880]   no no not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for because they are not all Israel
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:51.520]   that are of Israel neither because they are of the seed of Abram are they all children
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:59.120]   but in Isaac shall thy seed be called he says don't you run away with the notion that everybody
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:06.800]   who belongs to the nation of Israel is a child of God not at all there is a true Israel within
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:14.960]   that larger Israel that everybody can see they're not all Israel that are of Israel
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:22.280]   which you remember in modern terms means this they're not all Christians who say they are
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.520]   they're not all Christians who call themselves Christians they're not all Christians who
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:36.280]   are members in the visible Christian Church no no God knows who are his people and it's
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:43.880]   this true Israel that is the the remnant according to the election of grace people like the Apostle
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.680]   Paul and others very well then it comes to this you see that there would be no remnant
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:55.560]   at all if God didn't keep it if God doesn't preserve a remnant everybody will fall we'll
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:02.360]   all be like Sodom and Gomorrah we'll all fail but the teaching concerning the remnant is
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:12.680]   always that it is a remnant that God himself reserves and preserves it is a remnant according
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:20.080]   to the election of grace I don't know what you feel like saying what I feel like saying
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:30.240]   is this thank God that it is so if I thought my eternal future depended upon me I would
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:41.280]   be of all men most miserable God calls and God keeps and God reserves and God will never
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:54.320]   leave and never forsake let us pray oh lord our God we come to thank thee and to praise
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:03.720]   thy name what amazes us oh God is that thou hast never called us and reserved us thou
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:13.920]   hast never made us members in particular of the body of Christ oh God we can but worship
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:24.160]   thee and adore and express our amazement and yield ourselves to thee anew and afresh thanking
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:35.600]   thee that what matters we realize this evening is not our frail hold on thee but thy strong
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:45.920]   almighty grasp of us oh grant that we all may know experimentally the pressure of thy
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:56.560]   hand upon us knowing that we are held and shall be held that nothing and no one can
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:07.440]   ever pluck us out of thy hand because it is thy hand lord grant that we all may know a
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:16.120]   sense of rejoicing and of praise as we realize this most blessed truth and now may the grace
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:21.200]   of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:27.240]   Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout the remainder of this
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:38.920]   our short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we shall find ourselves fully conformed
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:45.560]   to the image of his dear son in the glory amen.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:58.680]   Amen.
