[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.520]   - All right.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.440]   Well, speaking about productivity,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.740]   we should probably keep going here.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.000]   Let us move on to our next listener call.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.580]   - All right, the next question's from Brian from DC actually
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.940]   and it's kind of fitting 'cause he's got a question,
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.360]   goes into detail about physical versus eBooks.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.420]   I know you brought it up before,
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.120]   but he talks about some good stuff.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.720]   So let's take a listen.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.800]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Brian.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.200]   I'm a lawyer down in Washington, DC.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.680]   So I guess in a way we're neighbors.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.520]   This question has nothing to do with my profession,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.880]   but I heard you're looking for more questions,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.760]   so I thought I'd give this one a shot.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.400]   I'd be curious in your thoughts on eBooks
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.320]   versus physical books.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.640]   Instinctually, I always prefer physical books.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.400]   I like seeing them on bookshelves.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.840]   I like the visual reminder of the books I've read
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.400]   and the thoughts I've digested.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.760]   And perhaps most importantly,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320]   I like the idea that maybe my kids will see them
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.640]   and be exposed to them,
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.680]   or perhaps one day decide themselves to read
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.520]   some of the books that I found influential.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.160]   I know I enjoyed doing that when I was a kid.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160]   But I also noticed that ever since I've dusted
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.880]   my Kindle off the shelf, I read a lot more.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.600]   I think I can read at night while I get the baby to bed.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.640]   I can take it with me more easily.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.240]   I can get library books very easily on that.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.860]   And so my volume of reading has really gone up.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.760]   I also have noticed that I'm much more into
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.160]   taking and reviewing notes since I can just export that
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.720]   when I'm done reading.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.680]   Paradoxically though, that means I very rarely,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280]   if ever, go back and reread passages
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.120]   out of the electronic book,
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.040]   like I might in a hard copy book.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.080]   And so not a productivity question,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.720]   but I'd be really curious in your thoughts
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.760]   on eBooks versus hard copy books.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.600]   Thanks so much.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.400]   - Well, Brian, I would say use all formats
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   and don't overthink it.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   I use all formats.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.580]   They all have their advantages.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.320]   If we look at the five books I read this month
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.040]   that we talked about earlier in the show,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.680]   this particular month, two of them are audio books
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.560]   and three of them were physical books.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.400]   I would say in a typical month,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.820]   maybe one audio book, one or two Kindle books,
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.840]   and then two or three physical books.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.240]   So I have a mix
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.280]   and I don't have a huge rhyme or reason for it.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.160]   I mean, I do like having a physical library.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.940]   When you have a reading habit like mine,
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.000]   where you don't overthink it,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.400]   you just grab things that are interesting,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.080]   you just, reading's better than non-reading.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.040]   I am often taking these books out of my existing library.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.440]   So if we look back at this week's,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.880]   this month's books, for example,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.360]   two of them, two of the books I read in January,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   Giants by John Stoffer and The Jesuit Guide
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.320]   to Almost Everything by Father Donovan,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.380]   those were just in my library.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.220]   I just looked through my library,
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.080]   I wanna read something else.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360]   I just, hey, I should read this.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   I pulled it off my shelf as if I was in a real library.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.520]   So I'm a big believer in having a robust library,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.960]   not just the books you've read,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.880]   but books you wanna read,
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.120]   and I agree with you that it's good
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.200]   for your kids to see that,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.440]   and they can see books around
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.220]   and see them as a physical artifact.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.040]   But I think it's completely fine to use Kindle as well.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.560]   If you add real books to Kindle,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.400]   you're just gonna read more,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.740]   and then throw audio into that as well,
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.380]   you're gonna read even more.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.600]   And so I will go to Kindle if,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.040]   A, I wanna start a book right away
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   and don't wanna wait to have it sent to me,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   is one reason I'll use Kindle,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.020]   or two, if I'm going on a trip or something
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.400]   where I don't wanna bring a physical book,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.600]   or sometimes it's a book I'm not sure about I wanna own,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.660]   maybe I'll get it on Kindle.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.080]   So I would say, don't overthink it,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.280]   use all the formats,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.120]   and how you make the decision,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.080]   you can just do it like me,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.520]   which is, I don't know, randomly,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.320]   and it should pretty much work out.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.560]   All right.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.400]   By the way, reading with your kid,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.520]   putting the baby to bed,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.840]   that really resonates with me.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.040]   That's when we bought,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.440]   my wife and I bought the Kindle Paperwhites.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.900]   So we had Kindles that were unlit,
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.780]   and it was midnight feedings.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.060]   We're like, okay, we gotta get a Kindle
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.680]   that you can read while you're holding a baby,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.380]   or while you're trying to rock a baby to sleep.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.900]   And so, yeah, that brings back memories.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.300]   When I think of my Kindle Mini White,
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.900]   I think about having a baby and being tired.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.460]   [MUSIC]
