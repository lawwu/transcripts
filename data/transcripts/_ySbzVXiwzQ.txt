[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   First question is, you've reached a high level of ability/expertise in a number of fields,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.600]   martial arts, AI, music, etc.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.720]   I'm curious to know how you think about the learning process when juggling all of these
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.800]   things.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.440]   It takes a huge amount of time and dedication to master any one of these skills.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.720]   Where do you draw the line between balance and obsession?
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.400]   Put another way, how deeply do you immerse yourself when learning something?
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.280]   How do you schedule your day for work/learning?
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.640]   Is it appropriate to spend nearly every waking hour learning and developing a skill?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920]   Do you try to learn a number of things at once or narrow your focus to one thing?
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.200]   So first of all, obviously I have not achieved mastery in any of these things.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.600]   And I should also say that I don't think I've figured out the art of learning very much,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.400]   but I can give my two cents of the way I see it.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.080]   The one passion I think is exceptionally important for learning anything.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.000]   And if I look back at my life, I certainly have spent days and weeks and months at a
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.840]   time really obsessed with things.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.560]   Now to me, that's not necessarily useful on the long journey of learning a skill from
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.720]   the beginner to mastery.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   What has been useful to me, and if I have a philosophy on it, is probably centered around
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.400]   the rigor of discipline.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.080]   And making sure that every single day you do a minimum amount of that particular thing.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.680]   And you do it for weeks, months, years.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.360]   And also the way to remove motivation from the picture is to build a habit.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.200]   When I'm first learning something, I try to set the goal of doing a minimum of two hours
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.840]   a day of that thing for a year to build the foundation.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.040]   So that first year is really important.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.000]   It's so easy to kind of skip out on a few days, and then days becomes weeks, and weeks
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.520]   become months, and you lose completely that initial hook that pulls you into the depth
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.840]   of the particular topic.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.560]   So I really want to be a stickler of putting in, I would say one to two hours, but if I
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.360]   look at my life, successful things like music have been at least two hours a day for a year
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.160]   to build the foundation.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.640]   Then looking out farther into, let's say a five year range, you can lower that to about
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.580]   one hour a day.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.760]   And that's to build the, what I would think of as expertise.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.680]   I think you can get pretty good at something in five years if you just do it one hour a
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680]   day.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.080]   I don't know if this is true for everyone, but I think for me, not even an hour, just
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.480]   10 minutes a day, it's been really surprising how good I can get at a bunch of little things
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.960]   from just doing every single day.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.680]   Not even 10 minutes, like one minute a day.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.600]   Because it rarely becomes a one minute thing, it usually blows up into a thing that takes
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   an hour.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.360]   But if you just set a hard lower limit and make sure you do it every single day, no matter
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.800]   what, no matter where you are, you end up forming this habit and there's an accumulation
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.600]   effect of skill that's just fascinating.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.640]   So that's five years, and I think at that point, the skill is solidified nicely.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.120]   I don't think it's mastery by any means, but there's a level of expertise that seems to
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.240]   persist for a long period of time.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   What I found with music for me, not singing, just music.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.800]   I haven't actually practiced singing, I suck at singing.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.640]   But the music part, I think I've achieved a minimal kind of understanding.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.440]   And at this point, just even 10 minutes a day for the rest of your life is one way to,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.480]   I think, take further and further steps into mastery.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.920]   Again, I think mastery is impossible.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   But to increase the skill over time, I think a very minimal amount of time, but every single
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.120]   day is good.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.840]   The other magic thing about it is you can, at this point, at least for me, take off months
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.880]   at a time, and when you return to it, you'll pick up almost right where you started.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.800]   I don't think you wanna overdo it, but I think after you put in that first few years of every
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.320]   single day of an hour or two, there's something about the mind that's kinda solidified in
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.320]   there.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.400]   I've certainly had months where I don't play guitar at all, and I return to it, maybe it'll
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   take a day or two and you're right back into it.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.240]   But still, if you really wanna grow, you wanna put in every single day.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.520]   For me, 20 minutes is just the right minimal amount to give me time to get pulled into
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.440]   the task fully, get immersed fully, enough to where I can pick up little tidbits of new
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.000]   stuff, new ideas, to kind of get going, ready for the next day.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.160]   For me, there's always a kind of fascinating dance here between passion and discipline.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.200]   I think passion goes up and down, and that's where discipline is essential to keep carrying
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.520]   you forward, to keep doing the thing every day.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.040]   And I'm not a big believer of resting and then returning to the task.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.400]   I'm a bigger believer in when you don't really wanna do it, still grinding it out, and day
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.600]   days later, your passion for the thing will return.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.920]   People are different, but that's how I am.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   Because the greater danger for me is when you take a break, when you rest, is you're
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.600]   going to destroy the habit that you've built.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.080]   And once you destroy the habit, it's too easy to never return to the pursuit of expertise
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   that you were on for many years before.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.120]   Also a related question was asked.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.000]   I loved your video on recipe for success in AI.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.920]   Do you have any advice for dealing with frustration/difficulty in making progress?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.480]   I'm learning high school math right now with a proof-based course, and sometimes it gets
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   hard.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   I feel like crying.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   Do you have any advice for pushing past frustration at dead ends?
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.920]   Thanks.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.020]   I personally think that struggle is a sign that you're on the right path.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.480]   So all the things in my life that I've gotten the most meaning from learning, I've struggled
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   through it.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.560]   I think the biggest reward at the lowest level of your brain, like the things you actually
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.400]   remember, and just the self-satisfaction and happiness you feel about life, is when something
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.580]   is really hard, but you stick to it, and then you eventually succeed.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.200]   That locks in the lessons into your brain that makes you feel good about yourself, that
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   gives you more confidence for keep doing that in the future.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.920]   Also, I think this is helpful for a bunch of people, like David Goggins.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.040]   It's not as helpful to me, but I'll just give it to you because I've tried it and it doesn't
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   really work for me.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.520]   But a little mind hack, which is imagining that you're kind of a competition with everybody
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.840]   else in the world.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.760]   So if something is difficult for you, imagining that it's probably going to be difficult for
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.120]   a lot of people, and if you just stick by it, you're going to leave all those people
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.920]   behind you, and eventually, if you keep doing it long enough, you'll be the best person
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.000]   in the world at it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.040]   So kind of seeing struggle as a sign that most people would be quitting at this point,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.320]   and it gives you motivation that like, struggle is a sign that you're on the path towards
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.640]   being number one.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:24.840]   If you enjoy the kind of idea of you being at that top tier of excellence in a thing,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.360]   then that kind of mind hack can help.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.800]   I personally don't often like to think in that way, especially in competition with others.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.160]   I just like the art itself, so I enjoy the idea of pursuing mastery, not in comparison
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.440]   to others, but just for myself.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.040]   So in that sense, that mind hack doesn't really work for me.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   I kind of tend to believe that if I embrace the grind of habit of every day doing something,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   that months from now, years from now, as I've had many times in my life, I will experience
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:06.280]   these moments, these long periods of flow of truly enjoying the process of practicing
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   that thing.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.200]   So for me, music, now that I've achieved the level that I've achieved on my own personal,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   quiet, private moments, I can truly enjoy feeling the music I'm creating on the guitar,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.160]   playing Jimi Hendrix, playing Stevie Ray Vaughan, improvising different blues, or even just
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:36.120]   like much simpler songs like these crying melodic songs of Eric Clapton, Wonderful Tonight,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.360]   or even just strumming in a way where I can also sing.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.880]   It allows me to enjoy both the musicality and the deep meaning and the words and all
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   that kind of stuff.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.860]   And that was only possible because I put in that time in the early years of the foundation
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.860]   that I built.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.520]   It allows you to enjoy life.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.760]   And I believe in that.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.680]   If you form the habit, if you do the thing every single day, eventually you'll get to
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:07.480]   a set of activities that you enjoy partaking that are a source of a lot of meaning and
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.120]   happiness in your life.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.960]   So you can think of it as a mind hack, which is believing that discipline eventually leads
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.200]   to a meaningful life.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Hope that answers the question.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Good luck.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.540]   Good luck.
