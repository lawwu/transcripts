[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   All right, one more question. Matt says, "What do you think of the critique of
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.060]   hyperlinks expressed in the writings of Nicholas Carr?" Well, Matt, I think that
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.460]   critique quickly aged, it quickly aged, and the specific content of that critique
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.820]   is not that relevant, but the spirit of that critique is really relevant. So just
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.780]   briefly, I think Matt is talking about the book The Shallows by Nicholas Carr,
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.940]   which is now pretty old, it's from the first decade of the 2000s, and it was one
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.820]   of the first books to look at the impact of content consumption online on our
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.740]   ability to think deeply or think clearly, and back then the studies he was
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.620]   citing had to do with the impact of comprehension of reading websites that
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.740]   have hyperlinks because you read for a little bit and then you follow a
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.100]   hyperlink and you follow that hyperlink, as opposed to linearly consuming
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.420]   information as carefully structured and written by the author. Now, it's less
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.460]   relevant today because people don't read long articles with hyperlinks anymore,
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.980]   the technology went past that, that's an out-of-date technology, but things
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.140]   are even worse. So instead of now making it easy for you to escape from a
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140]   carefully structured piece of long-form content, we just got rid of the carefully
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.820]   structured long-form content and we just read 250 characters for Twitter or
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.300]   captions on Instagram or we shortened that down to memes, let's just have a
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.780]   picture with a couple sentences on it, or videos that are incredibly
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.740]   tightly edited, boom boom boom boom boom, and so we got rid of the option of
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.380]   even not following rabbit holes by just making everything just quick rabbit
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.060]   holes. And I'm sure that is amplifying the issues Carr talked about, reducing
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.460]   attention, reducing the comfort when it does come time to read something like a
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.060]   book, reducing our comfort with doing that, our mind wanders, we can't sustain
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.780]   attention. So yes, the hyperlink critique quickly got aged, but the underlying
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.820]   spirit of the medium of internet communication pushing us towards a more
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.700]   fragmented mind, those issues have amplified to a point that I think even
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.820]   Carr wouldn't have predicted in his most pessimistic moments back when he was
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.580]   writing that book.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.160]   (upbeat music)
