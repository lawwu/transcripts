[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   You may remember a couple of years ago during peak Zerp,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.300]   everybody was doing these day in the life of a tech worker, and
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.480]   they would show you what it's like to work at LinkedIn or
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.600]   Microsoft or Google. These companies provided perks because
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.960]   they recognize that their employees were working on
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.280]   important things and they were sacrificing. If you have an
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.160]   employee who is that dedicated, the least you can do is buy them
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   lunch or dinner. Another generation came into these
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.760]   companies and cluelessly thought that they were entitled to these
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.280]   perks simply for having a business card that had the name
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.640]   Google on it. They showed that they were overpaid and
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.720]   underworking. It infuriated management at these companies,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.280]   they realized that they had created a culture of
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.800]   entitlement. All those people got laid off hard problems
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.960]   created strong team members at these companies and those strong
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.880]   team members solve those problems and created wildly
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.240]   profitable companies. Those wild profits created massive
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   entitlement. And now with the layoffs, we're back to strong
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.540]   team members solving important problems in the world and the
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.560]   cycle starts anew.
