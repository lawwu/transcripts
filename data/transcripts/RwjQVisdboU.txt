[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   What do you got your mouth for your most anticipated trend of
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.500]   2024? I think this is the most important year for Bitcoin that
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.860]   has ever existed. We are probably days away from a series
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.900]   of ETFs being approved. And so this is the moment for Bitcoin
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.800]   to to use that old term cross the chasm and really see
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.180]   mainstream adoption where our parents and our grandparents
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.240]   understand what it is can buy it and then do buy it. And I think
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.340]   that if all of this comes to pass, Bitcoin will be a part of
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.140]   the traditional financial lexicon by the end of 2024. So
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.800]   that is my most anticipated trend of the year.
