[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Today on the show, I have an interview for you with personal finance blogger Lauren Bolling
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:26.720]   from the website LB and the Money Tree.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.400]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.960]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.600]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.720]   Today I bring you an interview with a young lady named Lauren Bolling.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.000]   We're going to talk about finance in your 20s and 30s and various decisions related
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.800]   to establishing yourself as an adult, including how to set up a house so that it makes you
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:58.560]   money instead of costs you money.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.480]   My guest today again is Lauren Bolling.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.560]   She writes for a website called LB and the Money Tree.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.440]   Lauren reached out to me or actually her publicist reached out to me and mentioned a little bit
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.160]   about her story.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.280]   Her story piqued my interest.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.920]   I went over and checked out her website and decided to invite her on the show.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.680]   You'll hear in the content of today's interview a little bit of background, a little bit of
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.000]   information on who she is, but also some of the various ups and downs of her financial
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   journey.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.640]   She was a delight to talk to and it was really interesting to hear some of the impact of
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.920]   different steps that she took in her life regarding different aspects of her financial
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920]   journey.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.040]   I was particularly attracted to bring you this interview simply because it talks about
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.080]   the more normal day-to-day aspects of finance.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.960]   It talks about the things that most of us have faced, young people going out, getting
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.800]   their start in the world, moving to a new city without any money.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.840]   Lauren's got a really fun story.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.400]   Some of the ups and downs and the lessons learned in her growth as a personal finance
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   writer.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.600]   Especially, I also love to bring you the impact of this.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.800]   I want to share with you a little bit about the story of the impact that her personal
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.760]   finance blog opened up to her from a career perspective.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.960]   Enjoy this interview with Lauren.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.080]   Lauren, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.240]   I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   Lauren Ruffin, PhD
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   Hi.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.520]   I've been looking forward to hearing a little bit about your story because you have, in
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.800]   the same way that I guess we all have, you have a unique financial journey.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.280]   You've shared a good bit of that on your blog, but I'd love it if you would start
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.640]   and share with me a little bit about your journey as it relates to personal finance
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.760]   and the lessons that you've learned along the way.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   Sure.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.920]   I think it all started when I went off to college.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   I didn't have any type of money talk with my parents.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.160]   I had no idea about good things to do.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.080]   I got my first credit card.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.160]   Being away from home for the first time, I think I was dealing with a lot of self-esteem
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   issues which manifested itself in a huge shopping problem.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.720]   I went through college battling that.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.120]   Finally, my junior year, my parents suggested I go see a therapist to help me cope with
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.680]   this why I felt the need to shop when I was feeling so poorly.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   That helped.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.760]   I no longer had a shopping addiction, but I had $10,000 worth of credit card debt.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.720]   A fun reminder of a past life.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   Absolutely.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   People think, "Oh, I graduated college with $10,000 in debt."
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.360]   They don't think that's a big deal, but that's just credit cards.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.120]   That was just extra spending.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.640]   I had a job all four years.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.760]   I was blowing through that.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.600]   My parents paid for my education, which I'm very thankful and I see now as a huge gift
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   and blessing.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.720]   So $10,000, that was just my bad habits.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.400]   I wanted to move to New York to become an actress.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.440]   I have a theater degree that I'm no longer using.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   I got up there.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   I famously moved with $300 and a prayer.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.120]   I slept on a lot of people's couches for weeks until I found a job and got on my feet.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.600]   It was right around the time that I was sitting at my desk job and all my friends were out
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.920]   auditioning and taking great classes and meeting fun people that I realized that my bad choices
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   had consequences.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.680]   I knew that the shopping was bad and I wanted to get a grip on it, but when you spend on
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.600]   a credit card, it feels like a present because it's not actually coming from your bank account.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.760]   That really hit hard for me.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.640]   I had to work for about a year and a half in order to pay off all the credit card debt
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.160]   and get into a good place.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.000]   By that time, I felt like maybe the acting thing had passed me by.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   I vowed then and there that I was never going to let my bad financial choices keep me from
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.040]   doing something that I really, really wanted to do.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.640]   So I moved home.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   It was a 25-quarter-life crisis, whatever.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.880]   I decided I'd worked at a hedge fund and I wanted to write and learn a bit more about
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.920]   money, so I decided to start a blog, just documenting my money choices and what I'd
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.480]   learned and my thoughts and feelings.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.280]   At first, it just started out as a fun project and hobby.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.320]   Then people started reading and it took off and it became more of a structure and a tool
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.880]   I used to start the next chapter of my life.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.240]   So that was about three years ago now?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   Yes, it was.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   I've been blogging for three years.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   You're almost 30 then?
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   I'm 28.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   Yeah, don't say it like that.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240]   Awesome.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.880]   I'm turning 30 in a week or two and I'm excited about it.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.120]   It's a great – don't give in to what our culture tells you about age.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   There's nothing better than growing in maturity and learning from your past day by day.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.620]   So obviously then you're financially independent and you make millions of dollars from telling
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.600]   people what to do with their money based purely on your blog and you live on a beach and you
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.800]   type some stuff into a computer and you're a millionaire now, right?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   No.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   No.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   What did I get wrong?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.880]   I am not a millionaire.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.320]   I actually just had a feature come out in the June issue of Redbook Magazine called
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.080]   Happy at Any Income and I was profiled as a woman who lives happily on her income, which
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.480]   I'm fine with telling you is $75,000 a year.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.640]   I was working full time and doing the blog on the side and then I bought my house and
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.120]   I rent out rooms so that was sort of the total income pie.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.360]   The great thing about the blog was that in April I was able to build up my freelance
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.000]   writing enough to leave my full time job.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.560]   Now I do work for myself full time, which has been really fantastic.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.000]   But I don't make a million dollars but I do live sort of a location independent lifestyle,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   which is incredible.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.840]   You're primarily writing financial content for other publications or in various fields?
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.220]   It's in various fields.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.200]   When I started my blog three years ago, my only talents were acting in theater, which
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.080]   I didn't want to do anymore, and then I worked as an administrative assistant, which isn't
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.280]   the best, most glamorous job.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.280]   I thought I was going to have to go back to school but I went into an interview for an
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.240]   administrative assistant position at a technology startup here in Atlanta where I live.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   The CEO is one of those big picture thinkers and he wanted to hear about all my passions
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   and my hopes and my dreams.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.680]   I was telling him about this blog that I just started and how that was really an area of
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.480]   passion for me and social media and learning all about it.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.840]   He thought that was really cool and I didn't get that job.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.000]   But then three weeks later, they created a position for me to come and run their blog
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and social media.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.560]   From there, I entered this career in marketing that I never had to go back to school for.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.520]   I feel incredibly fortunate that the blog was a springboard for me to enter a new career
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   path.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.280]   Lewis: Did you want to be a freelance writer when you started the blog?
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.440]   Lauren: No, absolutely not.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.280]   I wanted to be a writer but I didn't think I wanted to write about finance.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.920]   I just wanted to write something every day, something that mattered that wasn't just a
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.640]   diary of my thoughts and feelings and what I had for breakfast and what I was doing.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.680]   So I knew I wanted to write but I never had the intention of, "Oh, I'm going to start
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.560]   this and use it as my portfolio to have this big career."
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.360]   It was literally something I just fell into.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.560]   Lewis: It's interesting and the reason I'm just emphasizing it is I've seen this story
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:35.480]   play out time after time after time and I've encouraged, frankly, everyone to start sharing
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.160]   in some format, whether through a blog, through a podcast, through a YouTube channel, just
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.820]   to start sharing a little bit of their story and encouraging other people in some way that's
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.440]   unique to them.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.640]   It seems as though many people have the idea that the major benefit of doing that is going
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.680]   to be that I'm going to become financially independent off of my YouTube channel and
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.840]   I'm going to make all this money from YouTube content fees.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:06.320]   But the reality is it may just simply serve to focus your thoughts and when you have an
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.080]   opportunity to sit down and write and express yourself or when you have the opportunity
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.560]   to sit in front of a microphone and speak and just simply share your thoughts, it helps
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.960]   you to organize and clarify what you think and what you believe.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.160]   After a while, you start listening to what you tell other people to do and you start
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.160]   doing it yourself.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160]   Laeigh: Absolutely.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.880]   I couldn't agree with that more.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.480]   Not everybody can work for themselves and I think employers especially find it incredibly
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.880]   encouraging when someone has the hustle to put together something online that they package
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.600]   and sort of brand and market themselves.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.360]   I think those are all really great skills to have.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.440]   If you think about it, the only way we really learn things is by sticking our fingers in
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   them and doing it.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.880]   I mean, you can go to school, which is great, but you really only know once you start doing
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880]   it.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.160]   So I definitely agree with that sentiment.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.600]   People should just start doing things.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.280]   Anything they want to do, just go do it.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.080]   Preston Pysh (00:36:40): Practically speaking, when you moved to New
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.200]   York City, you were working at pursuing a career in acting.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.240]   What way laid that and it sounded like the finances were a challenge.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.120]   Was it simply that you needed to work to support yourself and pay your minimum payments?
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.840]   What specifically happened that that career got set aside, I guess?
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.920]   Laeigh Nevins (00:37:02): At first, it was the finances.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.400]   I moved up there with $300.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.560]   I didn't want to sleep on someone's couch for forever.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.520]   Unfortunately, I had people who were incredibly kind to me and friends who were very generous,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.920]   but it was the finances.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.320]   I knew that I moved there with no savings, so something had to give.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.240]   My parents had supported me through school, and then my mom bought my plane ticket to
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.000]   New York and was like, "That's it.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   That's all you get.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.520]   Your cell phone, your health insurance, you're off the gravy train now."
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.960]   At first, it was the finances, but then once I got that under control, I stuck my foot
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.440]   back into the theater thing again, and I realized that I wasn't as passionate about it as I
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.160]   needed to be in order to be competitive with the other people who I was auditioning against.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.120]   You have to get up at five o'clock and go sit outside in the cold for auditions, and
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.480]   you have to constantly be taking classes that you really can't afford all the time.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.920]   It's a hustle, and you have to really love it.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.240]   I just realized that wasn't for me.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.320]   I hate auditioning.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.520]   It makes me really nervous.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.880]   You come home and you think, "Oh, I had this passion," but passion isn't what you think
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   it is.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.800]   When I was a little kid, I used to write plays and perform in them for whoever was nearby,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.480]   and my parents thought that that meant that I needed to be nurtured as an actor and performer.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.880]   But really, I think I always wanted to be a writer, and that was always there.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.320]   Now that I have the blog and everything that's happened, I definitely feel like I finally
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.920]   found my fit.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:07.680]   You mentioned the help of a therapist in connecting with your credit card debt.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   What specifically was that process like?
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.520]   How did that person encourage you?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520]   How did they help you?
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.800]   What did that actually look like?
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.440]   It was eight years ago.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   It was 2007.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.160]   I'm trying to think back.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.960]   I know we sat down and we talked a lot about what was bothering me, and then she asked,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.720]   "Well, when you're upset, walk me through.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   What do you do?
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   Do you go home and do your journal?
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   Do you have someone you talk to?"
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.360]   I said, "No, I go to the mall."
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.920]   I walk around, and all the shops cheer me up.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   I'm walking.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   It's exercise.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   It's fine.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   She's like, "But then what do you do?"
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.080]   I say, "Well, I go into a store, and I always leave with something."
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.120]   It was just a lot of Q&A around identifying these patterns that I had.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.400]   Then, once we found my pattern, we worked really hard to find out what it was in my
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.520]   life that was a spending trigger.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.200]   For example, I was in college at the time.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.120]   Anytime I didn't do well on an assignment, that was a trigger.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.040]   I had to work especially hard to not go to the mall after class or when something bad
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   happened.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.680]   I think I was in there for about four months with her, just talking through everything.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.200]   Tavis: Did you work to adjust your spending habits on your own?
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.000]   Were you conscious of a desire to change and simply weren't able to do it, or was it almost
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   subconscious?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.640]   Jessica: I think with any addict, and I use that word lightly because shopping can be
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:47.320]   an addiction, but with any type of bad habit, there's a rock bottom.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.680]   I think for me, it was at the point when I maxed out all my credit cards, and I had to
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.800]   move home with my parents for the summer.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.040]   They were like, "Where did all your money go?
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.120]   Where did the money go that we gave you, the money that you worked for all year in your
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:07.000]   part-time job?" and having to come clean and see how upset they were when they found out
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.080]   that they were working really hard to give me something to set me off on the right financial
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   foot.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.000]   Then behind their back, I was undoing it with all of the credit card spending.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.920]   Seeing how hurt they were definitely made me get my act together.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:26.160]   Tavis: Have other people talked to you about this topic since you've shared that publicly
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.960]   and shared experiences with you about their own compulsive spending and how they tackled
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   that?
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.680]   Jessica: A few people have reached out and emailed me and said it was something that
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.440]   they struggle with.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.260]   The more surprising reaction has been from people I know, especially back college friends
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.260]   from that time.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.440]   They were like, "Well, we knew you were spending, but we had no idea that it was this thing."
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.280]   I had one reader email me and tell me she had a problem getting drunk really late at
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.400]   night and then she'd shop online.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:06.040]   Then she'd wake up the next morning and have all these emails like, "Thank you for shopping
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   at AmZam.com."
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.040]   I was like, "What should I do?"
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.520]   I said, "Well, something's happening.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.240]   You're spending triggers that you're home alone at night."
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.280]   I have to straddle a line to not be careful because I'm not a certified financial planner.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.840]   I'm also not a therapist.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:30.400]   I don't ever want to give someone advice because I feel like I'm not qualified to do that or
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   it makes me a little uncomfortable.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.920]   Dave: It's an interesting discussion as far as paying attention.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.920]   I sometimes wonder with regard to helping people.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.080]   I sometimes wonder if it's possible to learn some of these lessons without making mistakes.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:55.960]   Thankfully, I didn't max out all of my – well, actually, thankfully in college, I wasn't
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.320]   maxing out all of my credit cards on compulsive spending.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.800]   I did go into credit card debt when I was in college.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.840]   It was primarily paying for class and things like that.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.320]   I remember an experience that really affected me and it was when I was in high school.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.800]   At that point in time, I was working during the summer in order to earn a little bit of
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.000]   spending money and also in order to be able to earn some money to contribute to my high
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   school tuition.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.880]   My parents paid the majority of my high school tuition but they sent me to a private school
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.960]   and one of the aspects of our deal was for me to contribute a little bit of money to
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   that.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   I don't remember how much it was.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.600]   It was fairly negligible, I don't know, $100, $150 a month, something like that, not a big
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.840]   deal.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.560]   I had to work during the summer and I had to make my way through that.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:49.960]   There was one summer I was working on a sod farm and I had a little bit of freedom in
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.800]   terms of coming and going.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.520]   There was a gas station near that sod farm and at some points, I had a fairly boring
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.080]   job and I would go to the gas station and I would buy food from the convenience store.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.240]   They had these amazing chicken wings there and a little fried food thing.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.720]   I somehow wound up, I would go there every day and I guess I would wind up going there
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.120]   at lunchtime and then I would take a mid-afternoon break and I'd drive over there to the gas
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   station and I'd get some.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.440]   I get to the end of the summer and it comes time to pay my tuition bill and I look in
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.840]   my bank account and instead of the $3,000 or $4,000 that I usually had there with $1,800
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.520]   for tuition and a couple thousand bucks of spending, I look in there and I have something
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.120]   like $1,500 in my bank account.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.440]   I went and I was very embarrassed.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.160]   I went to my dad and I'm like, "I don't have the money.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.320]   I don't have any money."
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.000]   He made me go back through and figure out what I had done with the money.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.960]   I went back and did a forensic accounting process of what I'd spent.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.800]   I started to figure out how much I had actually spent on chicken wings and soft drinks at
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.400]   this gas station.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   It was a horrifying amount.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.040]   It was thousands of dollars because I would go every day and I was like, "Okay, $5.50
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   here."
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.220]   It was absurd.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:07.760]   That entire year, I was so broke that I was the cool high school kid.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.480]   I wouldn't deign to ride the bus.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.280]   I would drive the car and I'd put $3.37 a gas in it because that was all the money I
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.800]   had and I would beg lunch money from my dad and not buy lunch and just go hungry so I
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.280]   could put gas in the car.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.560]   I just remember how deeply that impacted my life for the good because the mistake was
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.480]   so deeply imprinted on me and I never wanted to do that again and to this day, every now
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.160]   and then I'll buy something at a convenience store.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.040]   But if I ever look at a convenience store, there's such a deep suspicion in me that
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.360]   thing's going to come out and get me.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   I got to have my guard up, my defenses up, that it really helped me.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:54.320]   It's one way of just sharing my little story but I often wonder if experiences like that,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:00.480]   if they're optional or if they are an important part of growing and learning and if in fact
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.320]   they don't contribute far more than they take away.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.440]   I think that at some point you do have to make a money mistake in order to really sit
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440]   up and pay attention.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.880]   Something about, and me and my finance blogger friends talk about this all the time, something
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:22.100]   about money just isn't super interesting to people as a whole.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:28.400]   So you have fashion bloggers and beauty bloggers and they get tons of traffic day in and day
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:35.480]   out and you're like, "Why isn't there a money blog that has that much traffic?"
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.800]   I think it's because people don't really pay attention to their finances until they
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   really have to.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   Mad Fientist With regard to a philosophy, where did you
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.640]   go after tackling the spending issues?
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.560]   Where did you go to start learning about the overall construct of money and personal finance?
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.920]   Jessica Lange Right around the time I had my desk job in
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.600]   New York, LearnVest, the financial planning startup had just been founded and they were
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.280]   kind of making waves.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.520]   They had this great library full of tutorials in terms of how to budget and what you need
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.560]   to be doing with your money.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.880]   I looked at Mint and I looked at LearnVest as far as a spending app to track my money
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.320]   from my checking account.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.800]   So I went with LearnVest because I felt like they had such a much more robust library.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.840]   From there, that was sort of my first crash course in education.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.840]   I can't remember.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   I'd have to go back and look.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.960]   I think you might have to pay for those courses now, but back four years ago or five years
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   ago they were free.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:48.360]   So I learned about the 50/30/20 budgeting method where it's like 50% of your take-home
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.760]   pay to your expenses and then 20% to debt repayment and 30% your spending money.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.600]   Having those little buckets really helped me make my first budget and stick to it, which
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.320]   is how I was able to successfully pay off the $10,000 of credit card debt in about 16
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.320]   months, I think.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.480]   Have you changed your approach since then or do you continue to follow their recommendations?
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.320]   It's a little bit more lax now, especially since I just started working for myself.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.680]   My budget is kind of all over the place because when you have freelance clients, money doesn't
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.160]   always come in on the first and 15th of the month like you'd like it to.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.560]   For the most part, I think I live well within my means, especially being a homeowner and
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.840]   renting out the rooms.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.880]   That really helps create extra income.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.320]   But it is a little bit more lax.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:43.720]   I kind of just separate money for my expenses and then money that I want to put away and
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.960]   then everything else I kind of just spend as I choose.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:52.240]   I used to really ration it out like I can only spend $100 on eating out and now it's
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.800]   just sort of what comes up because every week is different, especially working for yourself.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.200]   One week you may have a lot of meetings and the next week you don't.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.920]   So I kind of just spend as I can with what I have.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.200]   You've been very focused on your blog and talking about your adventures in the real
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.080]   estate market.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.280]   Share with me some of the background as far as your goal when you got into the real estate
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.360]   market, some of the things that have been fantastic and worked well and some of the
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.920]   surprising disadvantages that you found.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.160]   That's a loaded bag of questions.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.920]   I was a finance blogger in 2013 reading all the financial content.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.800]   I was like, "I think it would be a great money move for me to buy a home."
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.880]   And shortly before I left New York City, I got the last of my Christmas bonus from this
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.600]   hedge fund I worked for.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.560]   And so I had a windfall and I wanted it to mean something.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.400]   I wanted it to be money that I could make it grow in some way and I really thought a
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.760]   house was the way to do that.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.000]   So I bought a home.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.840]   The story goes I was shopping with my then fiance.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.120]   We are no longer together.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   We didn't get married.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.000]   So I bought a house that was much larger than what I actually needed because I thought we'd
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.800]   be living here together and having a family and all of that, which was disappointing when
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   that ended.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.040]   But it actually ended up being a blessing because now I have all these extra rooms to
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.400]   rent and I don't pay anything to live here basically.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   My mortgage is completely covered.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.000]   Tyler Lenz: Are you willing to share the numbers?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.680]   How many rooms, how many renters, that kind of thing?
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   How much are your mortgage payments?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.680]   Shana Grayson Sure, sure.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.400]   So my mortgage payment is $900.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.000]   That was also in the Red Book article.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.880]   And I have two roommates.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   I have three bedrooms.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.280]   One is like an attic sort of master suite that I live in, which is nice because I have
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.880]   that separation from them downstairs.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.120]   And then I have two tenants.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.560]   One is my brother and the other is a friend.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.680]   And the third person kind of cycles in and out.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.640]   It's been someone different at different points.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.440]   But my brother's always been here.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.600]   And they pay me $500 a piece, which is really great, especially now that I work for myself.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.520]   It's nice to have that extra level of security.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.240]   So buying the home and being able to recoup some of the money that way by renting out
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   has been great.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:22.640]   But I definitely think were I to do it over again, I would have bought a house that fit
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.400]   who I was at the time and what I needed and not sort of this aspirational dream of where
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.960]   I thought my life was going.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.160]   And I definitely wouldn't have bought a home that needed it was a complete gut job.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.960]   I did a massive $60,000 renovation on this home.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:45.040]   It's a huge project for a first time homeowner, but someone who ended up finishing it alone.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.000]   It was very overwhelming and stressful.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.760]   And I think it's not something I'd ever want to do again.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.360]   How did you come up with the $60,000 for the renovations?
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:03.560]   So I lumped in the renovation costs with my mortgage via a 203k renovation loan.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.000]   So I bought the house and these numbers are all on my blog.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   You can find out I bought the house for $65,000.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.680]   I took out a $60,000 renovation loan.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.960]   So then the total was $125,000 and that's what I pay each month.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.560]   So it was well under what I qualified for.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.560]   And you can do that.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.520]   You know, ask your mortgage broker about it.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.080]   Tell me about the incentives that you shared on the blog that were able to help with some
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.640]   of the initial costs as well.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:37.560]   So there were tax credits for renovating a home in historic neighborhood that I qualified
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.560]   for.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.280]   Also at the time, they're not doing it anymore, but the city of Atlanta was offering grants,
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.200]   soft loans really, to first-time homebuyers who bought foreclosed properties in zip codes
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.480]   that were particularly hit hard by the recession.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.480]   So I bought a foreclosed home in one of the dodgier neighborhoods of Atlanta.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   It's definitely coming around, and I feel safe here, I should say for anyone listening
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.320]   who knows me.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:13.080]   But I got $15,000 because I did that, and that could go towards my down payment, it
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.880]   could go towards closing costs, and it's forgiven, $3,000 are forgiven for every year that I
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.280]   live in the home as my primary residence.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.920]   So basically I get three grand a year to live here, which is nice, and I only paid $1,800
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.040]   at closing, which is unheard of.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:37.600]   So on your blog you said that you get paid about $4,000 a year to be in the house.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.680]   What made the renovation, what made it so stressful in the fact that you said you wouldn't
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   do it again?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.840]   It sounds to me like it was a brilliant financial move.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   Thank you.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.360]   I can see that in hindsight, but at the time it was my first time working with any type
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.240]   of contractor ever.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.000]   I didn't do my homework, I didn't vet him as properly as I should have, I took the word
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.920]   of somebody who I also did not know super well, and he ended up just charging me out
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.360]   the butt for everything.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.520]   Everything was extra, he was doing things without checking with me first, so then everything
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.280]   was a battle.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   The biggest point of contention was when he put the air conditioning unit in the wrong
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.040]   place and we couldn't pass inspection.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.560]   I said, "Well, you need to move it, it's not my job to know what the building codes are
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.520]   for the city, that's your job."
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.080]   We went back and forth and back and forth and my parents had to get involved, which
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.000]   was embarrassing because I'd been independent for so many years and I thought I was a big
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.640]   girl and then when stuff hit the fan, I had to get my parents involved.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.080]   I'll tell you, I used to think that way.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.280]   I don't know, maybe it's because I'm turning 30 these days.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:51.160]   Certainly I am responsible for my own life, but I am thankful for the help of other people
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   more than I ever was.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   Absolutely.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.040]   I'm so thankful my parents are so kind and they're always willing to step in.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.720]   Especially being a woman, you're like, "I don't need anybody's help.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.160]   I'm a strong, independent, Beyonce type."
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.000]   They helped me out, we finally got it settled.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.680]   I racked up more credit card debt, finishing the renovation and overages.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.600]   The $60,000 wasn't enough to cover it.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.080]   You turned that into a story.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   Tell me the story of paying off that credit card debt.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.120]   You've done your homework.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.160]   You read my blog, I appreciate that.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.800]   I had about $8,000 of credit card debt at the start of 2014.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.120]   I didn't pay it off like I should have.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.040]   I was exhausted emotionally from the broken engagement and the runaway renovation.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.280]   I just ignored it for all of 2014.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.560]   I was very ashamed to be a personal finance blogger telling everyone what they needed
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.600]   to do with their money and I still had this debt that I hadn't really told anyone about.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:56.040]   At the start of 2015, my New Year's resolution was that I was going to pay off all of my
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.680]   credit card debt and I was going to do it in 90 days.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.720]   I did and it's gotten a lot of attention.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.000]   It was republished on Business Insider and a little bit of it's going to be in Women's
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.640]   Day magazine in the fall.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.000]   It was very exciting.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.160]   Why was it such a big deal to you to share that you had credit card debt?
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.760]   Why was it so tough for you?
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   Because it's a mistake I've made before and you'd like to think that you know better
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.120]   or that especially reading and writing about money all day every day that you'd make
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   better decisions.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.440]   But one good thing that came out of it was and how kind and supportive everyone was once
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.880]   it came clean was that I realized that especially with everything but especially with money,
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.400]   you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.200]   The way I look at it now is I'm going to be dealing with money for the rest of my
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.480]   life and I can't really say what's going to happen.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.760]   And so it's completely impossible for me to think that I may never be in credit card
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.580]   debt again.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:08.280]   What matters is how I rise from those kind of setbacks.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:14.840]   But do you feel that it was a mistake for you to get into credit card debt again?
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:22.960]   No, looking back on it now, I had stuff I had to do and I had no money and so credit
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.240]   cards were the way to do it.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.640]   The mistake wasn't using it to sort of finish the project and move on with my life.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:33.760]   The mistake was in letting it hang out for a year and accrue interest and not kind of
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.120]   stick my head in the sand and not pay attention to it.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:44.160]   I guess what I'm getting at is I'm driving at the point in effort to expose it because
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:52.600]   there's a real challenge that we face in the personal finance world in that some people
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.840]   have an outsized focus on no debt ever.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.960]   And yet my experience has been that many people have used debt to establish themselves and
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.760]   have used debt to establish business.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.880]   Most business owners with whom I've interacted, especially in the beginning, they have gotten
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.000]   themselves into a position of many of them deeply in debt, some of them a little bit
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   in debt.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.200]   A lot of times your credit cards just simply become the way that you get things going while
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.400]   you're building your idea and while you're working your way through.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:30.200]   For me, what I understand, at least from your writing, was that that credit card debt was
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.960]   primarily incurred as a result of finishing the renovations on this house.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   Was that accurate?
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   That is accurate, yes.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.880]   And I agree with your position on that.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.680]   I'm not one of those bloggers that says no debt ever, that you should only pay for things
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.400]   if you have the cash to funnel them.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   I mean, I'm a freelancer now and as I said, I don't always get paid so regularly.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.920]   So credit cards are how I fill in those gaps and then I pay it off at the end of the month
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.040]   or whenever the check I'm waiting for comes in.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.440]   So I see your point.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.240]   Yeah, and there's a big difference and here's where I think we need to do a better job,
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.080]   especially those of us in the personal finance discussion side of things.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.640]   But there's a big difference between your going out as, or my going out and putting
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.800]   chicken wings on a credit card or you're going out and putting whatever your drug of
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.960]   choice was on the credit card.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.320]   There's a big difference between consumption spending versus investment spending.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.960]   And if you say, "I put $8,000 of credit card debt to finish renovating this house,"
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:33.440]   and in essence, let's say if you were in local rents to rent an attic apartment like you
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.000]   were having a one bedroom apartment in your market, what would that cost you?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   In Atlanta?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Yeah, in Atlanta.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   About $900-ish?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Yeah, about.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.600]   They're in a nicer neighborhood than the one I live in.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.480]   Okay, so a little bit less.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.440]   You said on the blog that you were spending something like $900 on rent before that.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:57.400]   So if we were just to use $900 a month and then on an annual basis, that means that that's
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:06.160]   $10,800 of cost that you're saving for having the house renovated plus $4,000 of net profit
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.240]   basically in addition to your personal living expenses.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.200]   That's $15,000 per year of imputed income and actual income based upon that situation.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:22.320]   $8,000 of credit card debt to get $15,000 per year in place is really not – I mean
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.240]   that's not such an out of whack scenario.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:31.120]   $8,000 of credit card debt on the latest Manolo Blahnik or whatever your shoot of choice,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   that's going to sink you.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.920]   But $8,000 on a house that's going to cash flow at the end of the day is not going to
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   sink you.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.520]   It could if it were $80,000 and it could if the market turned and if you hadn't covered
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.400]   your downside.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:51.040]   But I just don't like the I guess emotional baggage that comes down to credit cards and
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.400]   I'd like to differentiate a little bit between investment debt and consumption debt and whether
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.000]   or not you take – in my mind, if you take consumption debt and you put it down and you
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.320]   put it on a home equity line of credit and it's all consumption, you're destroying
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   yourself.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.880]   If you take investment debt and you put it all on a credit card as you're starting
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.920]   a business and getting things going, that's probably – if it all works out well, that's
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.320]   probably going to have a net positive gain on your future.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:23.080]   So I don't like necessarily the fact that oftentimes we feel this emotional pressure
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:28.340]   not to talk about things because what can happen is especially in the personal finance
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.320]   business is we can present an image that is not in line with reality.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.960]   Most business people that I've interacted with have borrowed money to get things going
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.240]   and then when we find ourselves in a situation of needing to do the same thing, then we're
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.320]   somehow more critical because well, we're not those who do that.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   Rebekah: Right.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.000]   I'm going to call you the next time my finances go south.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.440]   I'm going to call you to get a little ego boost and tell me that everything is going
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   to be OK.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   I think it's brilliant.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.820]   I was reading your blog and you're talking about, yeah, I made all these decisions.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.620]   But look, I mean you've got this big house that's been renovated.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.840]   You got favorable terms.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.020]   You took advantage of your mortgage credits.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.540]   You had the mortgage credit certificate program.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.060]   You took advantage of these special incentive programs and yeah, it was a ton of work.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.260]   But you've got yourself in a situation where you can now make a transition from full-time
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.580]   employment to freelance employment and that from a lifestyle perspective will open up
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.420]   to you a lot of amazing possibilities.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.780]   So in my mind, yeah, perhaps you would go back and do things differently but there are
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.180]   a lot of benefits to it.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.180]   Absolutely.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.180]   I agree.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.380]   Question regarding this new YouTube series that you're doing.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.380]   Why?
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.460]   Awkward Money Chat.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.820]   So it's not 100% new.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.260]   I actually started it last year.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:52.380]   And I've been blogging for three years and I kind of wanted to do something a little
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.860]   different and I have a theater background.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.340]   I love being on camera.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.940]   I'm not afraid to say it.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:04.580]   So I thought let's do a video component as part of the blog where people come in and
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.780]   – because sometimes I feel like the blog is very much me and my story but I love hearing
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.260]   about other people's stories and the choices they've made with their finances.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.900]   And so I wanted to sort of put together a show that highlighted that, that was both
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.500]   educational and entertaining.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.740]   My friend Kyle Bumpus said that it was like the Funny or Die series between two ferns
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.700]   but with Zach Galifianakis but for finance, which I thought was so perfect because that's
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.700]   what I wanted to do.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:38.260]   Unfortunately, I have no idea what he's referring to but it sounds really funny.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:43.860]   He's interviewed Justin Bieber and Barack Obama and all of his castmates from The Hangover.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.860]   It's really funny.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.860]   You should look at it.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.260]   I'm the worst pop culture consumer of all time.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.220]   I consume zero pop culture.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:57.380]   Sorry to display my ignorance.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:02.580]   Usually I'm online with things that are online but in this case I guess I'm out
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.020]   of the bar.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.060]   Two last things that I'd like to cover unless you've got other ideas.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:15.420]   I want to talk about your article of the 30 financial milestones before age 30.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.340]   Whose idea was that originally?
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:22.300]   It was Bridget from a fantastic site called Money After Graduation.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.700]   She's from Canada but it was actually her original post and a lot of other bloggers
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.100]   did it and then I thought, "Hey, my birthday is coming up.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.100]   I'm turning 28.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.620]   It'd be a fun thing to do."
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:40.340]   Do you feel like these are important milestones for people to consider reaching?
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.540]   I think some of them are really great.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.900]   I think she got it from an article that she read but she was the first one to kind of
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.420]   put pen to paper and sort of track her progress.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.500]   Some of the ones like you should merge your finances with a significant other by 30, I'm
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   like, "Ugh, that's bullshit."
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.540]   What if you're not married by 30?
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.220]   What if you don't want to merge your finances with someone that you're living with?
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   I've done that.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.820]   It didn't work out and it was terrible extricating our finances from one another's.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.980]   So now when anyone asks me I say, "Do not join your bank accounts until you are legally
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.980]   married."
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.620]   Have you purchased your house with your fiancé?
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.620]   No.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.620]   No.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:27.060]   I bought it myself because I was the primary breadwinner but then also with our combined
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:33.500]   incomes we probably wouldn't have qualified for some of the programs that I participated
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   in.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.500]   So I bought under my income.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:43.180]   But we did have a joint checking account and we'd paid for a lot of wedding stuff together.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.420]   So why was it a disaster to have finances joined?
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:55.860]   Because after we split we had some problems with direct deposit, getting that separated
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.620]   because it was one of the things where a certain portion of both our checks because it was
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.440]   our bill pay account.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.380]   And then having to call someone up and say, "Hey, $700 of mine is in the checking account
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.180]   that you're still in charge of.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.180]   I need to see you.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.180]   I need that back."
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:15.700]   So having to be broken up and have this big emotional split is not fun.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.100]   I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.420]   Why did you originally join finances?
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.260]   Well, we thought we were getting married and we thought we were moving in together.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.980]   It just kind of seemed like the thing to do.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.980]   But that taught me.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.820]   I don't know if I just being a financial blogger and I've been in charge of my finances for
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.020]   myself for so long now.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.820]   I don't know if I could do it when I get married.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.620]   I imagine it's probably a big deal.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:46.260]   It's one of the people who are very strongly opinionated about it from multiple perspectives.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.860]   Some people are very strongly opinionated at why you should never merge financial accounts.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.860]   Some people are very strongly opinionated about why you should always merge financial
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.860]   accounts.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.980]   It's one of those extremely hot button issues in finance that if you want to make people
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:06.060]   upset just start telling them how they should manage their finance.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:10.220]   I've got my own perspectives on it.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:15.460]   But I'm drawing you out just because it's something that very few people seem to talk
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:22.820]   about and I hate seeing couples merge their finances prior to marriage.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.580]   It's almost always a disaster in my mind.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.160]   But there are people who anecdotally will share that it's not.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.820]   So you have to look at that and recognize the impact.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.140]   Yeah, no, completely.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.420]   Because when you're married you're going to be separating a lot of things legally anyway
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.060]   so a bank account is just another thing.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.340]   But when you're not married and then you have this bank account together it's like, "Ugh,
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.760]   why can't we just split and be done with this?"
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:55.140]   So it feels more like a divorce in that way even though we were just engaged or if you're
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.140]   just with somebody.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.340]   That's what happens even within the context of marriage.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:04.540]   Marriage just becomes a very difficult breakup of a financial partnership.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:09.980]   It's extremely, extremely challenging.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.900]   Other benefits of the blog and this was kind of the last perspective.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:22.780]   What stands out to me about your experience is it demonstrates you went to school for
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:29.260]   – I mean you had a desire to pursue acting and no desire to pursue writing and yet you've
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:34.860]   come up in a perspective where you're creating this web series and in a way that's utilizing
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:40.220]   some of your acting ability and you've built a new lifestyle for yourself.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.900]   Was any of that accidental?
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.880]   Was any of it intentional?
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.300]   What combination of accidental and intentionality was there in that?
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.460]   That's a toughie.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:42:03.120]   I would say that it started out accidentally for sure, probably like 95% accidentally.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   Maybe there was a glint in my brain that maybe this could be something.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:14.740]   But mostly it was just me starting a blog, throwing stuff at the wall, seeing what stuck
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.020]   and then when I finally took a step back and said, "Okay, here's what sticks and here's
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.660]   what doesn't," then I became more intentional with it over time, creating more of a structure
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.860]   to content, getting more targeted with what I was writing.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:31.700]   It's been a process over time finding out what my audience likes, what it doesn't, but
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:38.580]   then more so than just creating content, it's been 80% promoting myself through podcasts
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.820]   like yours, through press mentions, through guest posting, through SEO.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:47.780]   I mean it's a constant battle to increase traffic.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.740]   But the great part is that the more successful I've been with branding myself and growing
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.700]   my own personal brand, it has demonstrated to my employers that I am very good at marketing
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.700]   and branding other things.
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.180]   And now I do that for my freelance clients.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.540]   So it started off accidental and then became more intentional over time, if that makes
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.540]   sense.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.540]   Was it difficult for you to promote yourself?
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:17.060]   No, but I had kind of a crash course in that being an actor.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.500]   It's all about promoting yourself.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.140]   You're auditioning, you're constantly putting yourself out there.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.260]   A lot of my blog coaching clients have a hard time with getting comfortable with the idea
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:31.580]   of promoting themselves to friends and family, which ideally those are your first blog readers
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:37.180]   and the people who are going to go on and spread the word about what you're doing first
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.860]   before you get mentioned by big name sites or really get your name out there.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:46.820]   I'm going to invite you to come and speak to a group of high school graduates gathered
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.820]   together.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:52.780]   And they're coming together and I'm inviting you to come and speak about finance.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.060]   What would you share with them for a few minutes?
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.940]   I would say definitely don't shop your feelings.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.940]   That's bad.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.980]   And second of all, just live within your means.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:11.300]   I mean, it's hard, but it's actually so simple.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.940]   And it's easier to live within your means before you kind of get into your later 20s
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.780]   with this lifestyle inflation and you're making more money and you want to enjoy it because
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.140]   you work so hard.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.220]   I think a lot of my troubles just came from me expecting a certain type of lifestyle or
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:33.180]   perhaps the lifestyle my parents gave me rather than the one I could actually afford.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.500]   And I see this all the time even with some of the people I know in my real life just
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.260]   not living within their means.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.660]   Lauren, I appreciate your coming on the show.
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.540]   Plug your website and share anything else that you'd like to share as we go.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.740]   So I'm Lauren.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.580]   My website is lbenthemoneytree.com.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.740]   That's L-B-E-E like bumblebee and the moneytree.com.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.580]   I have a YouTube series called Awkward Money Chat, which is also on the site.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.420]   And if you sign up for my email newsletter, you can get your Grow Your Money Tree Toolkit
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.820]   for free, which includes tips on how to start a side hustle and grow a personal brand of
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   your own.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.020]   And I forgot to say you are an award winning blogger, a Plutus award winning.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.780]   Yeah, for Awkward Money Chat.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.060]   Yeah, I won last year.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.060]   It was very exciting.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.060]   It was a big day.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.500]   You'll be in Charlotte this year for FinCon?
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.500]   We'll have to meet up.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   For sure.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.940]   If anyone else wants to come out and meet you, FinCon is the place to be as far as if
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.180]   you want to meet Lauren and many other personal finance bloggers.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.340]   Lauren, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.340]   I really appreciate it.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.340]   Thank you.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.260]   I hope you all enjoyed that.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.500]   I always love personally hearing different people's stories and hearing all of the twists
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   and turns through which they've gotten, which have brought them through to where they are
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   today.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   And I think it's interesting.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.300]   I especially just love hearing people's financial journeys, especially when they chronicle them
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.340]   written down in the finance blog.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:46:00.060]   And then I'm always interested to hear the twists and turns in the path of their career,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:05.660]   just listening and understanding how their career changes because of their various activities.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.260]   So I hope you all benefited from that.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.500]   I hope you learned something and enjoyed, maybe found a few good ideas for yourself.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.500]   Check out Lauren's site, lbandthemoneytree.com.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.780]   Lbandthemoneytree.com, I think you'll enjoy some of her writing.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.440]   She does an excellent job there.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.820]   And also make sure to check out her Awkward Money Chats program on YouTube.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.060]   You can find that on her site or just search YouTube for Awkward Money Chats.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:32.780]   Oh, in addition to that, FinCon 2015 that we mentioned right at the very end in Charlotte,
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.620]   North Carolina, that will be coming up this September.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.620]   I will be there.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   Lauren will be there.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.020]   I will be hosting a listener meetup while I am there.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.300]   Details on that one, I figured them out myself.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.060]   But I will be there for that event.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:51.360]   June 30 is the ending of, I think there's a rate increase on the tickets at June 30.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.620]   So if you've been thinking about going and you've kind of been sitting on the fence,
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.900]   buy your tickets by June 30, 2015.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.900]   Otherwise there will be a rate increase.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:03.860]   And I think also June 30 is when the block of rooms that are reserved for FinCon attendees
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   is being released.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:11.180]   I'm going to buy actually my hotel room before I get that done tonight, get that squared
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.180]   away.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:16.860]   So if you want details on FinCon, go to FinConExpo.com, link in the show notes.

[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:50.420]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment, but
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.820]   your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.460]   about you.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:03.020]   Please develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:08.420]   trustworthy and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.260]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:19.140]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.740]   and I make mistakes.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.880]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment so
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.100]   we can all learn together.
