[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.880]   comment, discuss anything you want. That's what we do here on live Q&A shows.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:22.480]   We go to an open phone line here today.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   I've got three callers waiting on the line, and we will go and see what we have going on. First up today,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.160]   we've got Daniel in Texas. Daniel,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.200]   welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:43.240]   I am about to leave my current job, and I'm fully vested in my 401k.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   I've got about $20,000 in it at this point.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   It's currently
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.560]   in about, I think it's like a 55-year retirement plan. Standard, I'll be
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.200]   30 here in a couple years. So,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.760]   kind of standard plan on that. I am curious if you have any thoughts on
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.520]   what I should maybe transition that to, if I should just kind of leave it there and not mess with it, or if there's
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.720]   some other way I should
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.200]   transition that as I leave this current job. Are you going to another job?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.720]   Yes, I'm going to another job. Does the other job have a 401k?
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.920]   They do have a 401k. There is no matching with it at this point. They are a younger company.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160]   They're about 10 years old, so they offer a 401k,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.400]   but there's no matching. My plan is that I'll be taking a pay cut for the first year, and then hopefully
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.840]   make more money in my second year.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.000]   But unless they institute that matching, my thought would be more than likely. Anyway,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.160]   anything I do put into some sort of retirement fund, I'll probably put into a Roth
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.640]   IRA so that I do have access to those original funds if I need them for some reason.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.120]   And is the plan at this existing job a good one? Is there low fees, good investment options, etc.?
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.520]   Sorry, say that again? The funds that are currently held at your existing job,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   are they held in a plan that is a strong and good plan? Does the plan have good investment options?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.960]   Does it have low fees? What's the quality of the 401k plan where you are right now?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.400]   It seems decent. From what I can tell, it's got relatively low fees.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.680]   I don't remember that. I looked about a year ago, and I don't remember. From what I could tell, it had fairly low fees.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.000]   Investment options were decent. It does have a money market option. It does have a few different options in there.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So, I don't really mess with it a ton, and I haven't because it's not something I've put a ton of thought into.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.640]   So I've been happy with it. I haven't had any issues with it so far, at least.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.600]   And are you a resident and citizen of the state of Texas?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.760]   Yes. Okay. Well,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.840]   in general, the way that you look at it is, are there benefits to staying put
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.800]   when you have investment dollars? You say, are there benefits to keeping those investment dollars where they are?
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.600]   And are there benefits to rolling those investment dollars out to another location?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.880]   Usually, you'll have a better option of
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.720]   investments, fees, etc. in the open market when you're not just doing business with your company's 401k plan provider.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.880]   So usually, it's better to roll the money out.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.160]   Because with your 401k plan provider,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.120]   your employer has contracted with a third-party administrator to manage that plan.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.280]   They've selected a menu of investment options.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.800]   And the key to that menu of investment options is to offer a broad enough array of investments
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.600]   so that the plan fiduciaries won't be suable in court for not providing good investments.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.120]   But to offer, keep those plan options boring enough that the fiduciaries won't be sued in court for providing
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.000]   risky and bad investment options. And so most 401k's, you're going to have access to just the general vanilla
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.320]   mutual fund options. And they'll develop a menu of 20, 30, 40, 50, whatever is available in your plan.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.840]   Now those can work fine. And some companies have great plans, low fees, low expenses, etc.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.840]   But many times, if you take it out to the open market, you can have access to a much broader array of
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.400]   investments and a much broader array of
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.160]   options. Usually in the open market, if you just custodian an IRA with a low-cost provider,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.400]   especially if you're holding mutual funds, you may be able to have it
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.080]   just simply less expensive, cheaper in terms of the overall fees.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.040]   You can also do many more interesting things with it.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.760]   You can do interesting things from a financial planning perspective, like you're talking about, where you
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   roll the money over into a Roth IRA or pursue something else.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.720]   You can also do interesting things with regard to the investment choices.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.240]   You can invest IRA assets in all kinds of interesting things if you're into that.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.480]   So usually it's best to roll it out. Now the only, the strongest reasons to not roll it out
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.600]   involve asset protection. So both bankruptcy and
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.400]   somebody suing you. And
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.440]   the reason is your 401k is extremely safe. The money in a 401k is protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.520]   It's exempt under the federal bankruptcy regulations. My understanding in the state of Texas,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.720]   IRAs and Roth IRAs are also protected, but not being an expert on Texas law,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.480]   I don't know if that protection is codified.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.400]   I don't know to what extent that protection is applied to IRAs and Roth IRAs.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.120]   If you were facing some kind of legal problem or you are aware of something, I would move very carefully and I wouldn't take that risk.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.040]   But in absence of any circumstances that you're aware of why you would have some unique risk,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.760]   yeah, I think I would roll it out and try to save money and get better investments. I don't see any reason not to.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.520]   Okay, thank you. Yeah, as from when your show when you're talking about IRAs, I went look,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.920]   far as I can tell, obviously I would need to talk to a lawyer to know for sure, but deeper,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.760]   but it looked like there is
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.640]   code that says IRAs are both Roth and regular are fully protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   Which do you think it would be? I'm in a, I mean,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.040]   because I have my children and I have three kids, so with the child tax credit and where I fall,
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.480]   especially this coming year since I'll be making less money than I even think now,
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:46.440]   doing it would potentially be worthwhile to, if it's possible, to roll out my 401k into a Roth IRA so I have
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.040]   those funds and pay the penalties or would I just have to do the math on it?
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   Well, I would try to pay the penalties from, I would try to pay any necessary penalties from my other savings and not use IRA dollars
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.960]   first, if at all possible. And the reason is since you only have a limited,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.680]   since you have a limitation on how much money you can actually get into an account,
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   you want to keep as much money in there as possible.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.600]   And since you have the choice of paying taxes elsewhere,
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.000]   use the money in your savings or your checking account or whatever in your other financial
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.360]   resources to pay the taxes so that you can keep the maximum amount of money working in that growth deferred
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.120]   account. It would be foolish to try to roll it over to a Roth IRA and
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.840]   use the investment dollars in the IRA to pay the taxes unless you were absolutely certain that
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.120]   tax brackets or your tax rates are going up and you're gonna go up into a higher bracket.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   So use money that's in your account to do that.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   Yes, if your income is down,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.240]   you should go ahead and do the IRA if you have the money from other
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.920]   resources to go ahead and pay the tax. And that is a good plan and I do think it is, it's a good move.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:02.560]   What you'll do is you'll roll the money out of the 401k into a traditional IRA with your custodian of choice and
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.200]   then with that custodian you'll go ahead and make the conversion there.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.680]   So that way the 401k provider doesn't withhold any taxes from you
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.920]   and so you can actually just put it directly into a traditional IRA and then do the conversion. On the asset protection
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.640]   standpoint, good for you for researching the state of Texas.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.640]   In general, unless you can, and again, I would defer here to an attorney,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.960]   but here's my non-attorney understanding of the law, unless you can prove that the state of
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.080]   the state that's the jurisdiction that you're dealing with the law in is
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:47.680]   absolutely makes IRAs and Roth IRAs sacrosanct and unless you were confident that you weren't actually going to be moving states,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.760]   you would still rather, if you were facing a creditor situation or
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.640]   potential legal risk of some kind, you would still rather have it in a 401k. And let me explain why.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.000]   The reason why a 401k is protected from the claims of creditors is
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.480]   because all of the money is mingled and it's
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.760]   designed to be for the protection of the person. So a 401k account is protected from the claims of the company's creditors.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.320]   It's held in a separate trust for the claim and so it's insulated from the claims of a company's creditors, your employer's creditors, and
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.180]   then because it's a fairly normal pension account that's covered by the ERISA law,
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.960]   then it has the most ironclad protection. The challenge with
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.760]   an IRA is it's a much easier legal argument to make to somebody to say, "Hey, listen,
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.480]   we're gonna invade this account and it's only gonna hurt this person."
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.640]   And then you run the risk of what if you move from the state of Texas to the state of, you know,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.840]   whatever, that doesn't have that same protection. So I agree with you. I don't think it's
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.400]   necessary to be that paranoid if you are happy being a Texas resident,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.880]   but I just want to point out that if you thought something were going to change, then the 401k is superior.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.800]   Any follow-up questions, Daniel, or should I go on to the next caller? Is that enough for now?
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   Choose based upon your investment strategy.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.120]   So if you are going to invest in index funds,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.320]   well, pick whoever offers the cheapest index funds because you're dealing with an index fund. If you want to invest in
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.560]   you know,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.160]   tax tax liens, then you're gonna need a checkbook LLC by somebody who does that. If you want to buy gold coins,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.200]   then you'll need somebody who will help you to arrange that. If you're gonna do offshore real estate, if you're gonna trade stocks,
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:44.000]   you know, if you're gonna trade individual stocks, then you should custodian your account with somebody who is providing the
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.520]   platform on which you can make your trades. So think through your investment plans and then based upon your investment plans, choose your custodian.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:59.720]   Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. My pleasure. We go now to the state of Minnesota. Welcome to the call. Tell me your name, please.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.840]   Corey. Corey, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, Corey?
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.640]   Yeah, hi, yeah, I wanted to thank you for all your great content.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.560]   I'm helping my parents in kind of the initial stages of their
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:22.640]   estate planning and I went back and listened to your shows like 260, I think about
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.480]   trust and
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.280]   some of the documents that are helpful and
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   just trying to get kind of a sense of their plan to meet with the
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.880]   estate planner in the coming
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.200]   weeks or months here and they wanted me to try and do some research and trying to get a better understanding of what are the
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.160]   different options out there.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.420]   Just from a little bit of financial background, my
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.420]   parents, I think their assets, you know,
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:58.000]   combination of real assets and equities and things, probably around two or three million and
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:07.240]   my grandfather, who was also successful in business, set up some form of trust in the state that
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.360]   my parents have described to me that sort of
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.000]   passes the income to the grandchildren, but gives the income to the parents to use during their lifetime.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.320]   So there's some of those assets out there as well.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.040]   We're just trying to hear any thoughts or recommendations on how to kind of approach the
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.760]   overall estate planning process, things to maybe think about to ask at the
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.560]   visit with an estate planner or any other recommendations you might have.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.640]   What type of assets do they primarily hold? Mutual funds, IRAs, real estate, etc.?
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.200]   Yeah, probably primarily real estate and
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.300]   mutual funds and maybe individual equities as well.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.720]   So with estate planning, obviously it's an extremely broad question.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.480]   So let me give you just a couple of specific
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:01.000]   suggestions, which are about all I can do in this context, and then a couple of broader comments that might help you.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.240]   The best thing that you can do for them to have a productive meeting with their estate planner,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.520]   are they going to an estate planning attorney? Is that who their meeting is with?
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.840]   I'm not entirely sure. It's an estate planning attorney or
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.360]   it's probably part of a larger firm that has those services. They're the same firm that kind of worked with
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.640]   my father, my grandfather. Okay, so it's likely a law firm and they're meeting with an estate planning attorney.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:34.480]   The most useful thing in preparing for the meeting with the attorney is to have a complete balance sheet prepared
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.800]   that has the information on each particular asset class.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.280]   So they'll get the best bang for their legal buck if they don't have to waste a lot of the attorney's time coming up with
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.360]   the details. So if they are owning, let's say real estate,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.200]   they should come in with a balance sheet, a net worth statement, that says a list of the properties.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.080]   So if they're individual properties, I would have on that list of paper,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.600]   I would say one, two, three, Maple Street. On that you need to have the value of the property.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   This one is worth two hundred thousand dollars.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.960]   Put the tax basis or an estimate of the tax basis. The tax basis in this property is
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.620]   $100,000 and then make sure any ownership information is listed on that property.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.680]   So if it's individually owned, if it's held in an LLC,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.320]   whatever the ownership information is listed. And then any of course indebtedness as well should be associated with that.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.800]   So if they can come in with a complete list of all assets owned, all
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.200]   investment accounts, any investment account that is a retirement account,
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:42.680]   it should be listed there. That investment account listed beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries, a list of any
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.200]   same thing with stocks, if they own stocks or mutual funds that are outside of retirement accounts,
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.120]   they should list those accounts and make sure to list their estimate of the tax basis in those stocks.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.280]   And they should make a complete list of all of their property. If they have physical property that's significant, personal property,
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.760]   they should make something of a list of that and
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:07.200]   just come in with a complete balance sheet. If you come in with a complete balance sheet, that will help the estate planning attorney
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.400]   to have the data that they need to talk through any recommended strategies.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.720]   Additionally, they should think and talk about what they would like to have happen. What's important to them?
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.960]   Is it important to them to provide money to their children and to their grandchildren? Is it important to them to provide
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.600]   education accounts? Is it important to them to fund a certain charity?
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:35.120]   What's in etc. And then if they have information from their financial advisor and/or if they can prepare themselves,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.680]   they should come in with some kind of an estimate of what their assets,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.160]   what's expected to happen with their assets during their retirement years. If they are, how old are your parents?
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:54.160]   Mid-60s. Okay, so if they're in their mid-60s and they're planning to retire and they're going in to sit with the estate planning attorney and
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.560]   their financial projections for retirement show that they've got two or three million bucks,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.360]   but this is probably going to be drained down to nothing by the time they die at 95 years old,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.200]   then that's one direction of the planning to go.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.800]   If on the other hand they're living on the income from their parents trust and they've got two or three million dollars set aside here
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.480]   and that two or three million dollars is just going to be invested purely for the long-term benefit of the children,
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.720]   that's a very different scenario because if they aren't spending
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.360]   two million dollars, they're just starting with two million dollars.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.040]   If they've got a 30-year investment time horizon and let's say they could earn 8% on their money,
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:34.080]   then very conceivably that investment could, that two million dollars over the next 30 years could grow into 20 million dollars.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.160]   And so the numbers in estate planning can get very big very quickly.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.480]   So they need to have an estimate of where things, sorry, a balance sheet, an estimate or some kind of projection
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.440]   from their financial plan in terms of their retirement distribution plans and an idea of what they would like to happen with the money.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.560]   Then in the conversation with the estate planning attorney, they'll walk through
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.960]   those things and then they'll recommend
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.240]   appropriate strategies based upon what your parents are trying to do.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.280]   So that's probably just a simple answer that of what you can do and what they can do to prepare for the meeting.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   Is that good enough?
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:18.000]   That's great, thank you very much. My pleasure. We go on now to Daniel in Florida. Daniel, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.680]   Hey, Joshua, thank you for taking my call. My pleasure.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:28.000]   I've got a question for you with no answer, which is a tricky one.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.720]   What I'm looking for
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.360]   is I'm trying to get an idea of what your particular paradigm might be for
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   luxury purchases as opposed to investing.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:47.040]   So I'm getting a little bit of a late start and recently re-listened to your episode on catch-up investing.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.000]   It was the
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.840]   doubling penny episode.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.160]   And I'm trying to figure out how I structure my
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.200]   investment plan going forward with luxury purchases in the
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.280]   current day.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.000]   So what's a useful paradigm to think about?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.880]   You know, should I buy this new car or should I route this money into retirement and
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.440]   you know, make do with my current car for another five years, that sort of thing.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.120]   So I know that the answer to that is, well, you know, it depends on
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:26.080]   you as a specific individual, but do you have a particular paradigm that you would be comfortable sharing?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:34.280]   Sure. How you think about that? Sure. The first thing I think it's important to look at is the actual situation and circumstances
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.880]   of your life.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.840]   For example,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.240]   let's talk about a luxury like a house, right? A house can be a luxury expense.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:49.120]   But it's also there's a measure of that house that is just necessary. You need to live in a certain place.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.960]   But it's, in my opinion, undeniable that there's a component of a house that is a luxury
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.120]   expense. Usually when most of us go and start looking at real estate, we start looking around and we like the places that are nicer.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.800]   In my opinion,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   it's not wrong to buy something that's luxury if it's not going to cause many other
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:18.680]   harm, many other problems or harms to your, you know, something important and/or it's going to make a major benefit. So
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.120]   in my situation,
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.720]   my wife is
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.000]   just caring for all our children, right? She's at home all day every day.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.400]   I think it's entirely appropriate for us to have a more luxurious place for her to be
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.160]   with the children so that she has adequate space, so that she has adequate amenities,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.240]   things like that that are going to be helpful for her because that'll make a dramatic difference in her
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.280]   experience of life.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.800]   And so I think it's important to prioritize that because it helps something that's very important to us,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.000]   the integrity of our family.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.360]   I would view that very differently if it were just me and I'm talking about, you know,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.440]   is it wise for me to buy a luxury house that's just going to sit empty while I'm away every day?
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   And the reason what I'm driving at here is who's going to benefit?
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.320]   It's very nice for me to have as a single man,
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.340]   it's very nice for me to have a hot tub, a big pool right on the intercoastal, a nice boat to park behind that.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.560]   But I think it's really foolish because if I'm working,
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.040]   I'm going to spend most of my time working and it just doesn't seem smart to me to do that when I can just rent
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   a five-star hotel on Miami Beach whenever I want to go and do that and I can rent a boat whenever I need to do
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.200]   that and I'll rent the captain with it.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.360]   So the luxury of a larger house is at this stage of my life a more helpful thing because it's fitting something
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:44.800]   that's actually really important. And yes, I could, you know, we could stay living in a tiny little travel trailer.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.000]   We could do it if we had to but I'm not willing to do that.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.760]   I have enough money that I can afford the luxury. So practically speaking, I would say what benefit am I going to get from this?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.360]   So now to your car example.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.800]   Let's say I have a perfectly adequate intelligent car.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   It's a perfectly reasonable car and I've decided that I'm going to,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.080]   I'm thinking about upgrading it. Well, I would say why am I thinking about upgrading it?
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:16.480]   What benefit am I going to get for having a newer car? If the older car is pretty safe and pretty reliable and pretty functional,
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.680]   but I just want a newer one because I'm tired of this one, to me that doesn't seem particularly useful.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.640]   But if there's some other benefit of the car, perhaps it's going to be,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   it's going to be better for our children. We're going to have space. Perhaps it's going to be safer.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.760]   Perhaps there's a safety feature on the car and I have the money. I think that's appropriate.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.160]   I had a family member recently who just bought a new car.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   They bought a new Prius and one of the reasons they bought it was, of course, Prius is the second,
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.680]   the smartest choice for anybody that can't get away with a minivan.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:53.360]   A vehicle. But one of the reasons they bought it was because of the upgraded and improved safety features, the anti-collision features and things like that.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   And because his family member was getting older, they thought that that was a useful thing.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.280]   They had the money. Is it kind of a luxury purchase? Kind of. But there's a benefit there.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.840]   That's a really legitimate benefit in terms of those advanced safety features, the anti-collision features.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:13.560]   That's very helpful to an older person. So I look at it and say, is there actually a benefit? Now, it's your money.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:20.720]   So if there's, you weigh the benefits based on their own basis, because in life, maximization of net worth is not the ultimate goal.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.520]   The winner is not the one who dies with the biggest trust.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.080]   There's other components to life. And so even if you just say, I want to get another luxury expense because I just want it,
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.160]   I'm okay with that, as long as you can afford it and you're thinking about it.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   And there my tool is to say, what does this mean for me in the future in terms of the alternative use of the dollar?
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:47.680]   Let's say today I go and make a $50,000 expenditure. Well, if I don't make that $50,000 expenditure,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.480]   what else would I do with the money? Would I invest it?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.640]   And if so, how much would that $50,000 be worth to me in the future?
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.760]   And here, I think, is how we bring things into a matter of timing. When you're 20 years old
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.640]   and you're thinking about going and buying a luxury sports car, let me just do some quick math here.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.920]   Let's say you're saying, I have the money. I'm gonna buy a $100,000
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.840]   luxury sports car at 20 years old. So we'll start with that. And fast forward,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.560]   you can imagine yourself being 65 years old. So you've got a 45-year investment time horizon.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   Let's say you're investing your money at 8%.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   Well, that $100,000, if you could invest the $100,000 today instead of buying the luxury sports car,
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.880]   that's $3,192,000 that you could expect to have at the age of 65.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.320]   Now, in this situation, that's probably a really compelling
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.920]   feature. And it's really good for that 20-year-old to say, I'm gonna wait on this sports car until later,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:50.400]   and I'm gonna build towards that $3.1 million. Now, fast forward to the same person at 60 years old.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.000]   They have $3.1 million. Then that $3.1 million is gonna grow.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.200]   They have a business that they're doing fine at. Now, they do exactly the same calculation and say, well,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.280]   how much would this $100,000 be worth at retirement?
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.360]   Well, the answer now is that $100,000 would be worth $146,000.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:17.040]   And now they look at it and say, would I rather have this $100,000 luxury car or $146,000 in five years?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.760]   And there's a decent chance that they're gonna say, I'll go ahead and get the car.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.840]   So you have to bring in the time value of money, and you have to bring in the opportunity cost.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.720]   What are you giving up by having the opportunity cost, and what are you getting in the time value of money?
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.560]   You should think carefully about the opportunity cost and consider the costs for other people.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.240]   For example, I've bought lots of nice things. I've bought lots of fancy things.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.800]   What I have learned about myself is that my number one priority is financial freedom in terms of money.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:51.680]   I don't ever want to be in a position where I have to make a decision I don't want to make because of money.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.800]   So I don't want to live somewhere that I have to live because of money.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.200]   I don't want to say something or not say something that I want to say because of money.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.080]   I want to be in a situation where at any point in time I can do what I want to do.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.800]   I can live how I want to live, and I can say what I want to say without worrying about money.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.080]   And for me, the magic key to that is frugality.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.120]   Back to a long time ago, I did a show where it was talking about lentils.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.040]   And I can't, it was a short little one that I did.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.800]   Basically, the parable where one philosopher said to another, you know, if you...
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.080]   I'm gonna mess it up.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.480]   He said, you know, if you would say nicer things to the king, you wouldn't have to eat lentils.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.840]   And then the other one replied, I eat lentils.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.720]   So I can...
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:43.040]   The point is, by having frugal, by being able to eat lentils in that case of the silly story,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.600]   the philosopher didn't have to suck up to the king.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.640]   And so for me, I'm gonna weigh a luxury purchase and say,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.880]   does this mean I'm gonna have to suck up to the king?
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.120]   Does this mean that I'm gonna have to pretend that I think something I don't think?
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.720]   And if so, I'm gonna walk away from it.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.840]   Now, other people don't have that.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.480]   So I think with that time value of money, are there actually benefits?
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.720]   And in terms of your own opportunity cost, what would you be giving up by making the luxury purchase?
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.800]   When you weigh it that way, then you can wind up at a fairly rational
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.760]   analysis to decide if that luxury purchase is right for you or not.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.120]   Okay, that makes a great deal of sense.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.440]   And I do have a quick follow-up question if you have a second.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:23.680]   Go ahead.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.400]   It may be a way of restating the previous question.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.840]   But given the history of what you talked about on the show,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.360]   I guess you probably wouldn't be offended by being described as an economic
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.080]   doom and gloomer in the long run.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.200]   And I am 100% there with you.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.760]   Does that inform your investment decisions with regard to current luxury purchases?
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:52.560]   My investment plans have always involved the presupposition of a 7% real return.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.880]   And over the years, I've become very, very, very uncomfortable with that presupposition.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.880]   And it would drastically change my investment life going forward if I were to adjust that to,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.640]   you know, say a 3% or a 4%.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:12.560]   At what point do you, whether in your personal life or whether, you know,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.680]   giving me advice, at what point do you say, "Hey, enough is enough"?
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.480]   Where do you draw the line at, "Let's be reasonable"?
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   I don't know if that's a question that makes any sense to you.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:24.880]   It does.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.560]   Or if that's just a restatement of the previous.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.600]   So I'll answer it.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.160]   Before that, while you were speaking, I looked up the lentils anecdote that I butchered,
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.120]   and here it is.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.040]   The philosopher Diogenes was eating bread and lentils for supper.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.680]   He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus, who lived comfortably by flattering the king.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.080]   Said Aristippus, "If you would learn to be subservient to the king,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.320]   you would not have to live on lentils."
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:54.160]   Said Diogenes, "Learn to live on lentils, and you will not have to be subservient to the king."
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.680]   And that particular version of the old parable is from The Song of the Bird by Anthony DeMello.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   Episode 525 was dedicated to that particular parable.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.440]   And so that is what I was grasping for in my previous answer.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.640]   So first, to correct the record, I don't see myself as a doom and gloomer.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.960]   I'm not somebody who, in fact, I'm extremely optimistic.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:22.240]   But what I try to do is I try to temper that kind of optimism with realism, so to speak.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:29.520]   To me, it seems irrational to be pessimistic, to always see things as worse than they are.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.200]   But it's also irrational to basically screw up your courage and say,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.400]   "Well, it's always going to be great."
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.200]   Because the answer is no, it's not always great.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.840]   This always bothered me when I was a professional financial advisor, when I managed money.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.400]   Because there is a component of that business where you always have to say,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.320]   "It's always going to be great."
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.240]   And you do that because you're trying to influence your customers in a certain direction.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.200]   But you also do it sometimes because you're trying to influence
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.320]   them to purchase something that you have.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.080]   And so you always say, "Oh, it's going to be great."
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.440]   And this always bothered me because I could defend that to some degree rationally.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.640]   But I think there is a point in which you say, "No, it's a good chance things aren't
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.840]   going to be great or they're not going to be great for this particular time."
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.680]   So I am deeply optimistic about my life, etc.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.880]   But I look around at circumstances and I say,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.720]   "The things of the past are not always going to continue as they are."
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.840]   So the United States, for example, is not going to always be great just because it's
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.880]   the United States of America.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.680]   This is a perspective that many US Americans hold.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.320]   "We're the best."
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.760]   Well, first of all, you're not the best.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.880]   You have to look and say, "Well, are we the best in anything?
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.320]   What is the basis?"
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.440]   Because there are lots of countries that are better than us on almost anything.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.560]   And then you have to look and say, "Well, what caused somebody to be in that situation?
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.600]   And what was it that they did that led them there?"
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.560]   And that's to me what I say, especially when I look at the United States.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.880]   I do have a whole lot of doom and gloom in the future of the United States because as
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:04.800]   far as I'm concerned, the things that caused the United States to be great in many areas
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   are no longer the case.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.960]   So just a slight correction.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.560]   Now, to your point about interest rates and rates of return.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:22.800]   First, it is impossible that on the whole of everything, real interest rates on investment
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.080]   classes could be 7% or 8% forever.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.600]   It's not possible.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.200]   And the reason is because if you look at the time value of money and the compounding of
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:39.520]   money, once that interest starts going forever, once that snowball just keeps picking up and
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.280]   picking up, eventually it consumes the whole world.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:49.440]   Compound interest calculations become absurd because if they're at a high rate, you basically
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   consume all the resources of the world.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.200]   You can do an example and you can say, "Let's start with a molecule of air."
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.520]   And you start doubling that molecule of air or giving it a 7% return or whatever.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   And very quickly, you get to the point where every molecule of air in the entire universe
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.560]   is consumed.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.320]   And so the same thing can happen with investment predictions.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:16.080]   So can you have an invest at real rates of return across the entire economy at 7% into
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.040]   perpetuity?
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.800]   My answer is no, you can't because of the compounding of that.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.280]   So it just can't work.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.520]   And it hasn't worked throughout all of human history.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.600]   But does that mean that you can't get 7%?
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.160]   I'm more skeptical there because in every market, there are going to be winners, there
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.320]   are going to be losers, there are going to be different markets.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.040]   And I think you as an individual could manage your money in such a way that you would be
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   able to find yourself that real rate of return that you need.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   And so the key is not to look at markets in general, but to say, "How can I do it?"
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   There is a paradox in investing.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:58.400]   Your highest rate of return of your personal activities can come at your earliest, smallest
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.680]   stages of wealth.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:05.760]   It's very easy for a poor person or someone with low income to invest at a much higher
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   rate of return than 7%.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.680]   Very, very easy.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.440]   And so if you are at that stage of wealth, you can invest at 7%.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.840]   We can bring anybody up and just through simple frugality, I'll give you an example.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.640]   One of the things I noticed a lot, and I'll include this when I do more shows on what
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.360]   I learned RVing, but I was bemused to see how much money I could save on fuel by planning
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.120]   ahead with my fuel purchases.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   What I do is when traveling, I use GasBuddy to find out where the cheapest fuel is.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.360]   And I would try, when I knew where I was going, I would try to time out my fuel stops with
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.480]   the range of my truck in order to save money on fuel.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.160]   Because I could save very frequently through using GasBuddy.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.440]   I could very frequently save in excess of 50 cents a gallon.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:57.520]   Now, 50 cents a gallon savings doesn't sound like much until you put it out over a 37-gallon
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.640]   fuel tank and over 10 miles per gallon, and all of a sudden, 50 cents a gallon can add
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.600]   up quickly.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.640]   So just simple frugality of knowing what station in your town has the cheapest fuel can be
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.360]   very powerful.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.920]   I'm amazed when I see people sitting at the expensive gas stations that aren't particularly
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.440]   convenient filling up their vehicles.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.400]   I think, don't you know that two miles over and one mile to the side, you can save 50
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.120]   cents a gallon if you just use GasBuddy and get there.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:31.200]   A poor person who's living week to week and just has just enough money, that $15 savings
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.720]   can be a big, big deal and gives them a massive rate of return.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.680]   But to a rich person, that 50 cents per gallon issue is meaningless.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:45.200]   So what I say is, go for the highest rate of return you can, recognize that at the beginning
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.280]   of life, you can get a much higher rate of return by redirecting your energy and attention,
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.800]   and then keep yourself nimble.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.000]   And so this is one of the reasons why I've basically walked away from large publicly
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.440]   traded securities markets.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.480]   I don't see any reason why I should put my lot in with everybody else when I can go and
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.200]   invest at higher rates of return on my own.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.440]   They exist, the markets exist, I can find the inefficiencies, I've worked hard at it,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.520]   I'm going to continue to work hard at it, but I can do a whole lot better than 3%, I
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.720]   can do a whole lot better than 7% if I put in the work.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.480]   Now if I'm a multi-billionaire, it'll be tough for me to be involved in those markets, but
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.840]   I'm not a multi-billionaire, so I can get a higher return.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.240]   So not doom and gloomer, I just say, focus on what does work and invest where you can
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.800]   make the higher rate of return.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.600]   And unless you're super rich and managing a really large portfolio, which is tough,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.960]   I think you can, for yourself, make those higher returns.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.640]   And in the aggregate, in the macro economy, in time things will shake out.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.920]   There's always going to be an interesting corner that you can go and pursue if you keep
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.840]   yourself nimble in your investment approach.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.240]   Awesome, that makes a great deal of sense.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.760]   Thank you.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.960]   Play where you can, don't compete with people you can't compete with, compete where you
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.680]   can compete well.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.520]   If you're big, don't go be a jockey.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.040]   If you're little, don't go play football.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.880]   All right, we go now to the state of Oregon.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.880]   Welcome to the show.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:11.040]   Tell me your name and how I can serve you today, please.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   Go ahead.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   Oh, hello, this is Grant.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   Grant, welcome.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040]   How can I serve you, Grant?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.200]   Yeah, I just had a question about, so my wife and I have recently been married.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.120]   We are just married a little bit.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.520]   We're also married in like seven, eight months.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.920]   And I was just wondering, our age gap, though, is pretty big.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.280]   Like there's about an eight-year gap between us.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:41.160]   And I was just wondering what you had on advice for maybe like rental properties or maybe
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.560]   what type of insurance products you would recommend in case I die before planned, so
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   to speak.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.160]   How old are you and how old is she?
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.480]   I'm 31 and she is 23.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:59.880]   Well, at that age, there's not going to be a lot in this way.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:06.000]   So there are two major issues, I think, that come into play when doing financial planning
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.520]   for a married couple.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:14.040]   The first issue is going to be more philosophical with regard to having children.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.360]   So given that she is younger, if you guys desire to have children, that will be a better
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:27.560]   solution because a 23-year-old is far more able to have children easily, safely, comfortably,
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.420]   et cetera, than is a 43-year-old.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:35.400]   And so in your financial planning, if you desire to have children, she has a good number
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.440]   of years where she can still have children.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.120]   And so in that case, things are really good.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:45.960]   And even financially, anything that's of interest regarding to children is going to be cheaper
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.960]   at this point in time.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.160]   They actually use a term in motherhood, they call it geriatric.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   They used to do this.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.040]   I don't think they came up with a euphemism for it, but they would call it a geriatric
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.880]   pregnancy if a woman, I think, is in her middle to late 30s.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:04.120]   So one component would be think about the phase when, if you guys desire to have children,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.960]   when you desire to have children, et cetera, and recognize that earlier is better.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   From her perspective, she is in the time of her life now where it will be the easiest
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.820]   in her life physically to have children and the energy, et cetera, to have children.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.640]   Now the conflict there is with society because in general, the US American society doesn't
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.120]   look kindly on young people having children.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.560]   And so there's an argument there with biology versus society that you and she would be well
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.000]   suited to discuss.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.360]   But it's in her, your best interest as a couple if you want to have children to have children
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.600]   now at a young age versus waiting till later.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.160]   That may mean that you may need to reorient your finances around that.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:51.440]   So if you need to adjust your living circumstances so that you can afford to live on your income
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.160]   while you have young children, that would be important, but that should fit into your
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   financial plan.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.080]   The good news is with your being older, in many ways, it is an ideal situation where
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.400]   at this point, you probably are more established in your career.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.160]   You're in a place of being more established in your personal maturity.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.320]   And so you have enough income, enough maturity where you can support the household and have
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.580]   children at a young age.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.920]   That's different than many people who are younger and get married younger and they're
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.960]   scrapping around at low wages and not being established in their career.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.760]   So that's one thing to talk through and to consider.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.040]   The second thing then involves the end of life planning.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.440]   So statistically, you will die before she does just simply because you are a male and
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.880]   she is a female.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.620]   So that's always important to plan for.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:42.400]   And because she is nine years your junior, eight years your junior, then there's a good
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.960]   chance that that will play out even longer.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.320]   So there's a good chance that she will be a widow for a longer period of time.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.960]   Now, of course, you could die middle age, she could remarry, but if you live and grow
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.580]   old together and then you die at an expected time for a male and she dies at an expected
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:04.360]   time for a female, there's a very good chance that she will be a widow for an extended period
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.400]   of time.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.140]   And so you want to make sure that you plan ahead for that and make sure that she is prepared
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   for that.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.200]   So making sure that you have plenty of assets, making sure that you have plenty of life insurance
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.640]   money at this stage.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.080]   As your assets grow, you have to plan for her to have a long life as a widow and then
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.940]   make sure that she develops the financial skills and has enough good financial advisors
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.220]   around her where if she is left as a widow for an extended period of time that she knows
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.760]   how to handle the money.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.620]   One of the major challenges in many relationships is most often the husband is drawn to managing
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:42.140]   the money and if the husband dies and leaves behind his wife a widow, but she's not prepared
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.460]   to handle money, to understand what the family's investment plans are, to understand all of
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.540]   those details, then that can be very difficult where she's caught unprepared.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.740]   And so make sure that she's prepared for that circumstance.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:58.220]   Is that helpful at all?
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.220]   Any other follow up questions?
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   Is that kind of what you're thinking?
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.060]   You know, I mean right now we, my wife is pregnant and so yeah.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.060]   Congratulations.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.060]   That's good.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.060]   Congratulations.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.060]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:14.540]   You know, so we are definitely talking about that and you know, I just didn't know if you
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.980]   recommended say like whole life insurance, you know, as a result of our age gap.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.820]   Right now I have a 20 year policy with, for a million dollars, but I just thought because
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.500]   of our age gap, like you said, she could be widowed for a significant period of time.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.060]   Does it make sense for that?
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.500]   Maybe I mean part of my financial plan is to kind of pursue rental real estate as you
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.980]   know, a way to kind of help carry her over for that period of the time that she could
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.500]   be, you know, widowed for a long period.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.620]   I just didn't know if there was one that you said, Oh, that, that seems like a better fit
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   maybe.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.420]   Not necessarily at this point.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.740]   And let me ask you, tell me about just very briefly about your career, how much money
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.580]   you have and how much money you're earning.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:42:02.420]   So I am an accountant and I have our, we are currently debt free and we have probably I
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.180]   think $27,000 in net assets and I make $78,000 a year.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.180]   Great.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.580]   So to answer your question about insurance, the only change that I would suggest that
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:19.020]   you consider is in addition to your 20 year level term insurance, I'd love to see you
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.100]   with some annual renewable term insurance.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:28.540]   And the reason I say that if your wife is 23, then if her body functions according to
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:33.020]   the normal pattern, it's conceivable that you guys could have children anywhere along
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.100]   the lines over the next 17 years.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:41.340]   And so up until about age 40 would be the normal age at which you would, you would stop
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.380]   conceiving children naturally.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:50.100]   So that would be the normal process in terms of biology.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.460]   Fast forward and also in terms of you would have to consider, you know, do you want children,
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.100]   how many children, et cetera, all those things.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:04.060]   But if you fast forward 10 years down the road, if your wife is now 33, you'd be perfectly
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:09.060]   reasonable for you to have more children in her early to mid 30s.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.140]   There would not be any kind of, you know, difficult thing medically.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.620]   If you're in good health, she's in good health, that could be very normal.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.540]   Now in your 20 year life insurance policy, that means that 10 years from now, you would
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.320]   only have 10 years left on that policy.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.700]   And if 10 years from now you have another child or 15 years from now you have another
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:31.220]   child, then now you only have five or 10 years left on your 20 year term policy, which means
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.740]   that unless you are financially independent and able to self-insure because of your assets,
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.940]   now you're going to be, you might have a problem.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.960]   Now most likely everything would be fine.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.740]   You would just go ahead and apply for another 20 year term policy.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.980]   You're healthy, nothing's happened.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.980]   You could just get it.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.400]   That's what happens for most people.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.900]   But I don't like those risks.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.220]   So what I'd rather you do is have an annual renewable term policy that you can keep for
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.220]   a very long time.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.820]   There are companies in the market that sell it.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.140]   You can keep it as term life insurance up until you're 60, 70, 80, depending on the
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.740]   company, and the premiums are adjusted to your age and they just go up a little bit
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.100]   each year.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.340]   All of the term life insurance that I own for myself being in a similar situation as
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.820]   you is all term life insurance.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.220]   Sorry, annual renewable term life insurance.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:24.540]   I don't anticipate keeping those policies as annual renewable term life insurance until
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.460]   my policies can be enforced until the age of 80.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:33.580]   Technically, the premiums are miserable when you start to get into your 60s and 70s, but
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.460]   technically I could keep them until I was 80.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.380]   I don't intend to keep them that long.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:42.900]   But what I will do is I will have them until our situation starts to be more apparent,
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.500]   our financial situation 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now, and the progress of our
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.360]   family and our children.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.300]   So if things have happened that my wife and I have had children, we're not going to have
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:58.060]   any more children, our youngest is three or four years old, at that point in time I'd
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:03.900]   be happy to go ahead and drop my annual renewable term after having replaced it with a level
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   term.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.180]   But at this stage of life where you're not quite sure about any of those details, I'd
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.640]   much rather you have annual renewable term insurance.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.580]   That also gives you possibilities if over the long term you want to be in a situation
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.580]   where you might want whole life insurance.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:23.060]   So all of my term life insurance policies can be converted to whole life insurance until
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.460]   the age of 60.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:29.700]   Now I'm not planning to convert the majority of my policies to whole life insurance policies.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.380]   That would be too much if I converted all my term.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:36.460]   That would be too much whole life insurance for me to have in terms of the usefulness
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.100]   of whole life insurance.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.900]   But I like having it available as an option so that if I get sick, get hurt, get fat,
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.900]   you know, start racing cars, flying airplanes, scuba diving every other weekend, and jumping
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.980]   out of planes too so I can't get insurance anymore, I like having all that stuff locked
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   up.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.380]   So if we are extremely financially successful, I'll just go ahead and I'll move my term life
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.740]   insurance policy into a life insurance trust.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.500]   I'll have the trust convert the policy to a whole life policy, and then we'll keep the
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.700]   policies there.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.420]   And so the annual renewable term is a far superior planning mechanism to give you all
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.420]   of those options.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.380]   To answer your question though, I don't think any significant amount of whole life insurance
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.700]   at this point in time would be appropriate.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.220]   Be fine to get a little bit if you want some because you're younger, but at this point
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.180]   you need to build wealth.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.260]   And whole life insurance is not a good primary plan for building wealth.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.820]   It's better for you to invest into something that's going to have a higher rate of return,
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.900]   and then just use whole life insurance as a place for some of your longer term safer
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.860]   dollars that you're not going to invest into more aggressive pursuits.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.140]   And I think it would be inappropriate at this point in time for you to pursue much of anything.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   Fine if you want to have some $25,000 policies, $50,000 policies, put a couple percent of
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:51.820]   your income into that, but I'd much rather have you get higher rates of return by investing
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.260]   aggressively if you want to do real estate or investing in your business, buying multiple
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:59.020]   practices, building up your tax business, selling more products, etc.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:04.700]   Getting your income from $78,000 a year to $178,000 to $278,000 to $578,000 to $1,000,000.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.380]   That's what I would like to see you do.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:11.700]   And then as your income rises, then feel free to revisit the whole life policy discussion
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.700]   down the road.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.780]   However, your job is to leave assets behind for her.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   You can do that.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.060]   She can spend the money perfectly well if it comes in as a life insurance settlement
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:27.060]   or if it comes in as a giant real estate portfolio that she just steps in and takes over the
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.740]   trusteeship of.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.740]   That's no problem.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.780]   And I think it's premature for you to worry about that at this stage.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.780]   That's perfect.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.780]   I really appreciate the advice.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:37.780]   Congratulations on the baby.
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:45.900]   I hope that you enjoy the process and don't forget that it's a very special time.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.700]   My encouragement to you, Grant, is this your first baby?
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.700]   Is that right?
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   Yes, it is.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.700]   Okay.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.700]   Yes.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:58.920]   So spend the money and enjoy however many months remain until the birth of the baby.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:05.380]   Spend the money and enjoy some of the special things together as a couple that are hard
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.380]   to do when you have young children.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.220]   Young children are great.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.220]   They also are going to dramatically change your lifestyle.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:19.060]   So if there's anything on your list, on her list, if you want to go snow skiing or if
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.100]   you want to do anything that is crazy, go ahead and do those things now and spend the
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.340]   money now.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.460]   You can always make up that money later, but I think you and she both will appreciate that
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.460]   going down the road.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.460]   We go now to Texas.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.220]   Austin, Texas, welcome to the show.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.020]   Tell me your name and how I can serve you today, please.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.420]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:44.060]   My name is Coulter and I am looking to sell my business in a couple of years and looking
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:50.940]   for your perspectives on whether it would be more financially wise to try to lean out
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:56.260]   expenses over the course of the next two years to show a higher net income, which is ultimately
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:03.700]   a function of what the business is going to be worth, or if I should focus on driving
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:09.860]   sales higher, which hopefully would lead to a higher profit margin.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.660]   Is there a reason why you wouldn't do both of those simultaneously?
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.500]   Did I lose you?
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.140]   I'm still here.
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.140]   Sorry about that, Coulter.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.140]   Yeah, sorry about that, Coulter.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.140]   I muted one of my mics.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.420]   I need a cough switch on my recording setup.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:36.500]   Is there a reason why you wouldn't do both of those things simultaneously?
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.780]   Not necessarily.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:44.500]   They don't have to be mutually exclusive.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.380]   I just thought a little bit more detail.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:51.780]   It's a roll-off dumpster business, so it's going to be a pretty asset-heavy business.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:58.980]   We're currently doing about, I don't know, $700,000 in sales.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.180]   Net income last year was about $180,000.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:09.860]   So obviously, the more dumpsters that I purchase, provided that I can get them rented out, it's
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.940]   going to drive sales higher.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:16.940]   I've been a little debt-heavy.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:23.180]   I've got about a $300,000 business loan over the course of the next couple of years.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:27.540]   I anticipate getting that down probably to $150,000, $200,000.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:35.860]   Just curious if you had any thoughts in regard to this whole situation.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.980]   I do.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:42.060]   It's an interesting area of consultancy, and I'm not qualified to give you a proper answer
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.060]   to the question.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:51.700]   But I had a friend of mine who I used to refer clients to, and I'd be happy to refer you
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.100]   to him separately for a conversation.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.460]   I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.180]   I think he's still in the business.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.180]   But I have a friend of mine who exclusively did this consulting.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:06.500]   He exclusively would consult with people who were thinking about selling their businesses
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.420]   in order to enhance them, in order to enhance the value.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.020]   It always interested me to study.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:16.940]   I have a couple of books saved in my library that I haven't read yet on the subject.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.780]   I've always thought this would be something that I would really enjoy practicing in.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:25.300]   It's one of my backup consultancy business types of things that would appeal to me in
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.860]   terms of a niche to operate in.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:33.580]   There is a huge cornucopia of options available to you to enhance that business.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.380]   As you are rightly identifying, it's a big, big deal.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.540]   It's a big deal how you ... Whatever you do here is a big deal.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.860]   It can make a big difference in terms of your savings.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:49.300]   I don't know what the specifics are for your business.
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.180]   Here's how I would approach solving the problem.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.060]   First, I would look for any books that are on the subject.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.620]   I can't remember off the top of my head what those books are that are in my library.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.860]   I will try to look for them.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:10.700]   I would go online and search for ... Start at Amazon, of course, and search for business
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.460]   valuation, search for selling my business.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.540]   I would look for any search terms related to that.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.340]   As you go through the process of searching those search terms, see what books come up,
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:26.460]   read the reviews and the categories and try to figure out what the process is as far as
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.020]   what terms are going to be used.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.180]   Amazon's recommendation engine is so good that that'll be your best place.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.900]   They'll provide a couple of books for you, but go ahead and order a couple of books on
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.900]   it.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.540]   Also, then go to the business press, companies like Nolo, see if they have anything.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.940]   You should be able to find their titles in the Amazon search, but go to Nolo.com and
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:54.580]   search for business valuation there and see what they offer in terms of selling a business.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.540]   Start by ordering half a dozen or a dozen books on the subject and then work your way
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.540]   through them, the way that I handle things like that.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.540]   Buy the books.
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.620]   It'll be less than a dozen.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.140]   I don't know if it's a dozen, but it'll be less than a dozen that will have good ratings,
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.660]   be current, et cetera.
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.540]   Order those half a dozen books and just go through them.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.860]   At least get an idea of what the issues are.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.860]   Read the relevant sections.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.100]   You don't need to read them all cover to cover, but read the relevant sections so that you
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.120]   understand what those books talk about.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.420]   Then I would use those books as a way of referring myself to the people who are writing them
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:31.980]   because those experts who've written the books are probably decent people for you to reach
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.500]   out to for a consultation and get their specific advice.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:40.180]   Also importantly, I want to say more importantly, but I don't know if it's more or just simply
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:45.340]   also importantly, you want to do some research in your personal industry.
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:50.180]   If you know anybody who has sold the business or if you know anybody in your industry or
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:55.620]   anybody who's bought a business, call them up and ask them for any information on that
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.280]   process.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.900]   If you know somebody that sold a business, I would go and see them.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.720]   It's probably your best bet.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.140]   You can call them and talk to them on the phone, but probably what I would do is I would
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.140]   go see them.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:13.700]   Just book a plane ticket and go sit down and buy them lunch or if they'll give you the
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:19.640]   time and go see them and ask them questions about what worked well for them and get their
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:25.700]   information of what worked well, who did they sell to, how did that process go, were there
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:31.440]   brokers involved, what did they wish that they knew and interview them for the specifics
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.200]   of your business.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.700]   If they refer you to a business broker, somebody who is selling businesses that are in your
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.700]   industry, I would go see that business broker or have them come see you or at least talk
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:47.820]   to them and develop a relationship and get their input and information on how to actually
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   position your business.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.980]   So they'll be the ones who can answer the specific question of should you invest in
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.780]   what's going to make the biggest difference in the negotiations.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.980]   Would it be helpful to you to have more dumpsters out and more contracts or will it be helpful
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:06.660]   for you to have a higher net profit because your financing is eliminated, etc.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.980]   Those are the people who will answer that question for you and then follow their advice
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:16.500]   and then my only other comment is work to see if you can groom your own buyer.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:22.740]   One of the mistakes that people make is they just take whatever buyer comes along and usually
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.580]   if you can groom your own buyer, you'll be in a better situation.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:32.820]   So if you think the ideal buyer is a big corporation, start making the contacts at that corporation.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.020]   Start connecting with them, start meeting the people, do your research before your industry
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.060]   conference, whatever industry conference you go to, research who are the representatives
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.620]   of that industry who are going to be there, make personal friends with them, get the inside
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:49.980]   track so that those corporations, the large people that you've got the connections there.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.940]   If you think the best buyer for your business is a small local buyer, start looking around
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.260]   and seeing can you groom somebody, can you groom a team, can you groom an employee, etc.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:04.420]   Because if you'll groom your own buyer, then you'll be able to profit from it in the, you're
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:07.140]   going to get the highest valuation that way.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.500]   And then finally I would say analyze the structure of the business to see if you can separate
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:17.420]   the component parts in some way that will help you in your overall long term financial
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.420]   plans.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   For example, if your business owns, and I don't know how this applies to yours, I just
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.660]   want to use it as an example.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:30.020]   Let's say that I am a physician and I own an office building that I do my practice in
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.220]   or any business really.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:37.380]   The real estate is going to be separately valued from the business.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:40.100]   And so of course you would own the real estate and the business separately because you would
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.420]   do good planning there.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:46.060]   But the point is for you as an individual, you're going to sell the actual business based
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.860]   upon the business valuation and you'll sell the real estate based upon the real estate
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.100]   valuation.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:55.300]   But in your own planning, if you can separate the component parts, try to make it easy for
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.360]   yourself to sell the business but not the real estate.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.880]   And so in your personal business, if you haven't already separated the component parts, separate
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.420]   the component parts so that the business can be valued, so that the assets can be valued,
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:12.180]   and then you might want to hold the assets and lease them out or you might sell them,
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.180]   it's up to you.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.980]   But think about how you can structure all the components of everything you own so that
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.180]   it works best in terms of your long-term financial plan.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:23.620]   Because if you can keep the assets and lease them back to the company, whether it's a real
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:29.380]   estate asset or the physical assets, maybe you own all the dumpsters outside of the operating
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.100]   entity and you say, "Well, I'm going to keep the dumpsters and I'll just lease them," or
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:38.420]   whatever it is, however you structure it, then if you can profit on each of the components
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.940]   the best, I think that's also something worth considering.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.620]   So that's the best advice I got for you.
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.540]   I don't know a specific question, but that's how I would go about researching it.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.180]   And that's how you find the people who will answer those questions appropriately for you.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.180]   Perfect.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.020]   No, that's great.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.260]   I really like the idea about grooming the buyer.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.900]   That's very sage advice.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.860]   If you can do that, it's going to be your best win.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:04.620]   Now, businesses, the individual business might be outside of one individual's ability to
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:10.460]   buy, but if you can bring in the buyer that you've developed, you might hold a note for
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.700]   that buyer or something like that, that'll be your best because you'll have a confidence
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:18.460]   in their ability to run the business, you can help somebody else and still profit really
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.460]   well from it.
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.660]   So those are my recommendations.
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:23.660]   That's it for today's show.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.220]   I hope you enjoyed the Q&A show and I will be back with you very soon.
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.940]   Stay tuned and thank you for subscribing.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.900]   I guess the last thing I'll pitch here at the end, I'd love more reviews.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.580]   Last time I checked, we were at 985 reviews for the show on iTunes.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.940]   I would be thrilled to get that number over 1,000.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.260]   So if you'd do me a favor, if you've enjoyed today's show, grab whatever you're listening
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:47.380]   to me on, tune in, Spotify, iTunes, Google Podcasts, whatever you're listening to me
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:52.420]   on, grab your phone if that's where you're listening to me, click review, rate, and leave
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.420]   a comment.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.500]   10 words, one sentence, two sentences, perfect.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.220]   And that would be super, super helpful to me.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.580]   So thank you for doing that today.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.340]   Be back with you soon.
