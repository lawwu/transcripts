[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   In the fall of 2012, Bethlehem Baptist Church hosted a very powerful and memorable conference
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.980]   on disability.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.700]   It was titled "The Works of God Conference â€“ God's Good Design in Disability."
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.500]   The entire event was God-centered and inspiring and faith-building.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.640]   I encourage you to watch it all.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.140]   But in that conference, there was one particular bit from John Piper's contribution that
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.620]   really stood out to a podcast listener who sent us the clip to feature here on APJ.
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.120]   And here in this section, Pastor John is applying the testimony of the Apostle Paul when Paul
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.740]   says of his life that he was "sorrowful, yet always rejoicing."
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.340]   2 Corinthians 6.10.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340]   Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.380]   It's a paradox and a miracle and a mystery, and it needs to be applied to our lives as
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.340]   Pastor John does here.
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.540]   I've got a concluding statement and five brief applications.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.380]   The conclusion goes like this.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.980]   God is so sovereign over the disasters and the disappointments of our lives that he is
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.900]   able to make every one of them serve our everlasting joy.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.940]   He is so sovereign over all the disasters, all the disappointments of our lives, that
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.700]   he is able to take all of them and make all of them serve our everlasting joy.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.420]   This sovereign grace is the ground of your joy in sorrows.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.300]   Not after sorrows, but in the sorrows of deep disappointment.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.360]   So the Christian hedonist does not merely pursue joy after sorrow.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   He pursues joy in sorrow, in disappointment.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.420]   So the watchword of your life then becomes sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.820]   Here are five implications or applications of this.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.980]   And it really is quite profound what happens in a church when this takes hold and what
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.580]   happens in you, your family.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.580]   But I'll give you five.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.580]   Here we go.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.340]   Number one, if you experience this paradox of emotions, sorrowful, yet always rejoicing,
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.060]   you will never have to pretend again.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.780]   Your sorrow will be real.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.920]   Your joy will be real.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:40.380]   You won't ever have to be ashamed of saying, "I am very sad," because your sadness will
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.740]   not contradict or exclude being very glad.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.940]   That's number one.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.100]   Number two, if you experience this paradox of emotions, sorrowful, yet always rejoicing,
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:05.260]   you will be able to bear the weight of sorrow that is inevitable in this world of sin and
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.860]   brokenness.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.700]   The joy you know in the very moment of heavy sorrow will keep the sorrow from crushing
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.700]   you.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.540]   It doesn't make the sorrow less weighty.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.760]   By strength, it makes the sorrow less destructive.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.500]   So the second one is, this experience, without minimizing the sorrow, prevents it from destroying
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   you.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.820]   Number three, if you experience this paradox of emotions, sorrowful, yet always rejoicing,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:00.180]   your sorrow will not ruin the joy of others, and your joy will not offend the sorrow of
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.180]   others.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.740]   This is delicate.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.980]   This is the way we want to be, right?
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.580]   You want to walk through life in and out of relationships that are either sorrowing or
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.860]   rejoicing, and you don't want to ruin them.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.260]   You don't want to hurt anyone.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.900]   You don't want to offend the sorrow.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.880]   You don't want to rain on the party.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:29.820]   Your joy will be deep with its roots in the springs of God's grace, the very same grace
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.660]   that sorrowing souls need.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.820]   Your joy will be rooted down in grace, and it will understand grace as what people need,
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.140]   and you'll have discernment as to how to bless them.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.660]   Your sorrow will not be morose, gloomy, self-pitying.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.820]   I'm speaking to myself mainly here.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.500]   This is my battle.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.620]   I am defending sorrow in this message.
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.940]   I'm not defending moroseness.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.900]   I'm not defending gloominess.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.660]   I'm not defending self-pity.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.820]   I'm hating those in myself.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.220]   This sorrow that you have will have real love in it, and love cares for the good of others
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.580]   so that you don't ruin their party.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.160]   You may feel, see, I just think there's a huge amount of selfishness in sorrow that
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.220]   walks into a happy room and says, "You all wouldn't be happy if you knew what I knew
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.020]   about me."
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.060]   And you just ruin it.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.940]   You just spread your gloominess everywhere.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.460]   You're like, "What, you're the center of the universe here?
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.180]   Get a life."
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.200]   They don't need to know you.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.780]   You don't have to ruin this party.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.700]   Jesus can sustain you for an hour tonight.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.020]   He can put a smile on your face.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.020]   He can have you play some of the games, and you can go home and cry some more.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.100]   You think that's not hypocrisy?
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.900]   That's love.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.060]   Because it's different.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.820]   The sorrow that is being sustained by interpenetrated, simultaneous joy is of a different kind than
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.500]   worldly sorrow.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.780]   Worldly sorrow has so much self in it, so much selfishness in it.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.140]   And godly sorrow is real sorrow, but it's just been changed, profoundly changed by this
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:28.580]   underpinning of peace and contentment and satisfaction and joy and a sovereign God,
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.100]   so that when you walk in each situation, you walk into a broken situation, and your sorrow
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.220]   enables you to sweetly empathize, and you walk into a happy situation, and your joy
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.700]   rises to enable you to be a part of it.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.580]   People will watch over the long haul.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.540]   They won't miss your pain if you're real.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.980]   If you're walking in a church's life, and you're just living a normal life, week in
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.980]   and week out, they'll know your situation, and they will love you for not raining on
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.540]   the party and not being glib and silly at the funeral.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.860]   Number four, if you experience this paradox of emotions, sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:21.780]   the ministries of your church, from the worship service to the youth group to the ministry
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:30.580]   of disability, will be free from silliness and trifling, and will have the aroma of Christ
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:40.180]   with his wonderful paradoxes, the aroma of Christ who wept over Jerusalem like this.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:49.380]   Would that you knew the day of peace, but now it is hidden from your eyes, Luke 19,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:56.620]   verse 1, and yet rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.780]   and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.820]   them to little children."
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:12.460]   He wept, and he rejoiced over the same city because of the same condition.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.100]   Strange Savior.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.480]   We need people like that in the world who are inexplicable in worldly categories.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.140]   We need church services that people walk into and there is joy here, but it's quite serious,
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.580]   but the serious is not heavy.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.700]   It's that, "I can't figure this out here.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.700]   This is different."
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.580]   And many, many thousands of our churches are throwing this away in the name of being cute
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.620]   or clever or slapstick or like the latest TV or show some movies or anything to make
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.380]   it feel something that the people already know.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.460]   You don't want them to know.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.460]   You want them to be stunned.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:57.260]   And so God had showed up from another world and created something new on planet earth,
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:03.180]   not the latest movie or the latest comedy or the latest talk show host.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.660]   Why would you want to have the people feel at home with that?
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.460]   You want them to taste something so stunningly strange.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.620]   So that's what I'm trying to do is just talk about the strangeness of Christian life.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.780]   Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.500]   What does that feel like on Sunday morning?
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.180]   What's a youth ministry feel like?
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.020]   What does a disability ministry feel like?
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:38.140]   That paradox, that strange miracle has taken hold.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:44.980]   The spirit that will pervade your church will be joyful seriousness and serious joyfulness.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.300]   It won't be morose.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.580]   It won't be miserable.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.620]   It won't be self-pitying.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.980]   It will have a profound gladness about it.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.460]   I don't do money welcomes anymore because my present transition, but I used to stand
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.780]   right here in downtown, welcome the people every Sunday.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.940]   I loved it.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.900]   I love to have that little informal moment because I'm in the pulpit, I'm Mr. Authority.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:18.540]   And down here, I'm daddy in the living room.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.440]   And I was so profoundly aware I'm going to welcome these people in such a way that those
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:32.180]   who are coming out of the funeral and out of the wedding feel good about this moment.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.180]   That's impossible.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.380]   To have an impossible job.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.380]   You know what it makes you do?
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.380]   Pray.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.380]   Makes you desperate.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.620]   Makes you want miracles to happen.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:51.780]   Let me have a demeanor down here so that the hurting can say he knows and the ecstatic
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.020]   can say he knows, he gets it.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.780]   And everybody has a daddy who gets it.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:05.740]   It will affect, if you catch the paradox of these emotions, it will affect your whole
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.740]   church.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:14.680]   And the last one is, if you experience this paradox of emotion, sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:23.020]   the beauty and the worth of Christ will be exalted because he is most glorified in you
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.300]   when you are most satisfied in him.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:30.540]   And if you're always rejoicing, there's always some flavor of his excellency in your life,
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.020]   some flavor of his worth and his value, his beauty.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.620]   There's something about you that means you're loving Jesus.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.460]   You're valuing Jesus.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.300]   He's precious to you right now with all the tears flowing down.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.700]   And on the other hand, the tears that are flowing and the genuineness and the authenticity
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:57.100]   of your sadness shows you're not out of touch with the ugliness of sin in this world and
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.840]   the horrors of its effects in human life.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   You're not out of touch.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   You're not glib.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   You're not silly.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   You're not superficial.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   You're not blind.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.220]   You're not naive.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:13.780]   And when you get that in one person, the joy reflecting the infinite worth of Jesus and
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:19.380]   the sorrow reflecting the ugliness and the horrors of sin, you meet somebody more like
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.860]   Jesus and you want to be like him.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:30.060]   So we end, sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.860]   May the Lord work this paradox, this miracle.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.980]   And I speak, please don't over read this man.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:48.340]   I speak as one trying to understand and do this as a dad, as a husband, as a pastor right
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.500]   now, trying because I'm speaking over my head.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.340]   I'm saying words that I wish were more true here.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.660]   Don't walk out of here saying, "Well, I guess some people got that wrapped up."
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.820]   Nobody's got this wrapped.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:09.460]   I'm lifting up a possibility that we're all looking at and saying, "Really, Lord?
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.460]   Really?"
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.100]   Sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:19.020]   Oh, show me, show me what that would be like in my life.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.500]   Such a mystery and a bold point wrapped in an honest confession.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.020]   That was from John Piper's conference message titled, "When Jesus Meets Disability, How
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.260]   a Christian Hedonist Handles Deep Disappointment," preached on November 8th, 2012.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.100]   The clip was sent in to us by Hannah in Athens, Georgia.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.580]   She writes in to say this, "This sermon encouraged and challenged me in a time of deep disappointment
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:47.140]   to realize the gospel's ability to make sorrowful but always rejoicing a reality in my life."
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.140]   Amen.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.140]   Hannah, thank you for sending it in.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.620]   And thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.180]   All of our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.820]   You tell us what bits of Piper sermons changed your life and met you in your need.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.340]   We share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.860]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.580]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and the timestamp of where the clip happens
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.620]   in the audio and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:15.580]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.380]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.260]   Next time we're going to talk about podcasting, particularly the six dangers of listening
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.980]   to podcasts, podcasts like this one.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.900]   There are dangers and we're going to talk about them.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.900]   I'm your host Tony Renke and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John when we return
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.900]   on Friday.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.620]   We'll see you then.
