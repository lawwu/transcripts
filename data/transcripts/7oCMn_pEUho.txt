[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.400]   - Welcome back, Ask the Compound.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.720]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.600]   We love all the questions.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.020]   We love everyone in the live chats.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.440]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs again.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.680]   Birddogs.com/atc for Ask the Compound, obviously.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.880]   Promo code ATC to get a free Tumblr.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.960]   This week, Michael and I took a trip to Florida
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.080]   for a conference.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.840]   Everyone there is in their stuffy suits and dresses
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240]   and business attire.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   Michael and I are in Hawaiian shirts and bird dog shorts.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.320]   I'm wearing a pair of bird dogs right now.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.160]   Can you see these, Duncan?
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.040]   Look at, eh, eh.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   - Yeah, looks good. - The white ones.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.120]   I don't know if I can pull off the word fresh anymore
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.960]   since I'm an early '40s dad,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.040]   but that's the only-- - They're looking fresh.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.080]   - They're very fresh.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.900]   They're white.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.320]   I love 'em.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.080]   So the great thing about wearing these in Florida
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.440]   is it was like 88 degrees.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440]   It was very hot, and they're comfortable.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.280]   So Michael and I had them at the beachside restaurant,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.000]   you know, having a nice little drink,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.200]   having a little lunch.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   - Miami Vice.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.680]   - Yeah, walking around the beach.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.560]   They're versatile.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560]   You can wear them anywhere.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.980]   I wore mine in the pool.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.820]   It's great.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.360]   They're comfortable, they're stylish, they're versatile.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.000]   Go to, remember, birddogs.com/atc
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.960]   and get that free Tumblr if you want
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.240]   for putting the promo code ATC.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.300]   - Can I just throw in a quick,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.660]   it's kind of almost a complaint about bird dogs,
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.820]   is I feel like they make me look too cool.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.100]   I'm like, can I pull these off?
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.460]   I don't know if I can pull these.
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.100]   Like joggers, like I've never worn joggers.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.940]   They look really cool. - You can't be a hipster
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.180]   anymore if you look too cool, right?
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.020]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.860]   It's hard. - I think it's--
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.940]   - It's a struggle. - It's okay.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.500]   You moved out of Brooklyn to Connecticut.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.780]   I think we're gonna allow it.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.900]   - Yeah, okay, yeah, it makes sense.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.600]   - All right, lots of questions this week again.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.900]   I think our inbox each week
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.540]   is getting a little bit fuller and fuller.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.900]   We're not getting exponential growth yet,
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.620]   but we got a ton to get to, so let's do it.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.780]   - Okay, up first today we have,
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.180]   Ben showed the positive returns
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180]   for U.S. equities over the long term,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.400]   but how does the data look for global ex-U.S. performance?
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.660]   - Fair question. - Do you think,
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.480]   is this a gotcha?
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.780]   Are they trying to get you?
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.600]   Or are they just curious? - Maybe, well,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.440]   I don't know if it, I don't know,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.140]   that could just be, I hope it's curiosity.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.620]   So I love to show the win probability of the stock market,
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.540]   depending on your time horizon.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.380]   John, throw this chart up.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.940]   I did this going back to 1926,
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.420]   and it just shows one month, one year,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.080]   three, five, seven, 10, 15, 20 years.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.460]   What's your probability of seeing a gain?
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.160]   Okay, so since 1926,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.860]   the U.S. stock market has experienced positive returns
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.900]   56% of the time on a daily basis.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.640]   That's not that great, right?
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.540]   63% of the time on a monthly basis.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.380]   Go out to five years,
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.920]   and we're talking 88% of returns are positive.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.220]   10 years, it's more like 95%.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.640]   And then 100% if you go out to a 20-year basis.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.820]   Obviously, the usual caveats apply here.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.580]   We're not taking into account taxes or fees or inflation,
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.440]   but still, that's a pretty darn good track record, right?
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.640]   There's never been a rolling 20-year period
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.240]   where U.S. stocks have been down.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.600]   So my least favorite description of the stock market
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.000]   is that it's a casino.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   I hate this.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.660]   I hate when people say that.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.600]   Usually they say it when they lose money or it's down,
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.920]   or a stock goes down a lot.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.760]   Not even close.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.360]   The longer you play in a casino,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.520]   the worse your odds are because the house has an edge.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.360]   So the longer you,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.460]   I have a pretty good blackjack system,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.600]   but still, if I stay and play 72 hours straight,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.440]   eventually I'm going to lose,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.000]   and the house is probably going to win unless I get lucky.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.200]   The stock market is completely different.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.440]   It's the opposite of a casino.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.520]   The longer you stay in the stock market,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.720]   the better your odds are of walking away with a gain.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.480]   Now, this doesn't guarantee the magnitude of a gain, right?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.360]   And I can't guarantee that these exact figures
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.200]   will work going forward,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.520]   but that's pretty good, right?
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.480]   I worked with plenty of huge institutional investors
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.360]   over the years,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.640]   and they are obsessed with quarterly returns.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.200]   What's our quarterly return against the benchmark,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.320]   against our peers?
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.120]   And some of these endowments and foundations
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.480]   have perpetual time horizons.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.960]   They, it's basically endless,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.160]   and they care about quarterly returns,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.000]   which never made sense to me.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.560]   So I think the ability to think and act for the longterm
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.800]   for individual investors,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.600]   that's your huge equalizer, right?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200]   Patience is the biggest equalizer in all of finance.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.480]   So back to our original question here.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.840]   Is this just a US phenomenon?
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.440]   Does this work internationally as well?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.160]   Well, my original chart goes back to 1926.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.280]   We only have good data going back to 1970
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.480]   for international stocks.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.680]   So I have the MSCI World XUS.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.160]   50 plus years, that's good enough for me.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.560]   So John, throw up my table.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.480]   This is the World XUS Index versus the S&P.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.180]   Again, monthly, one year, five, 10, 15, 20 years,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.760]   and it shows the win probabilities.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.400]   Now, over monthly and one year returns,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.960]   the S&P is a little better, right?
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.760]   63% versus 60% for monthly.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.320]   One year, S&P since 1970 is up 80% of the time.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.920]   World XUS is up 70% of the time.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.300]   But look at five, 10, 15, 20 years.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.240]   The 15 and 20 years are both 100 for each.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.320]   They've never had a down period
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.040]   over 15 or 20 years since 1970.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.200]   10 year returns, you actually have a better win percentage
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   for World XUS than S&P.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.780]   S&P is up 95% of the time over 10 year periods since 1970.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.180]   The World XUS is up nearly 100%.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.100]   It barely happened, 99.6%.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.300]   Also a little higher for five years.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.180]   So I think some people might be surprised to hear this
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.860]   just because of the fact that U.S. stocks
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.380]   have done so much better over the past 15 years or so.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.720]   Obviously, again, probability versus magnitude,
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.920]   that's a different thing.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.060]   A lot of people ask me about
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.420]   the international versus U.S. thing.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.580]   And is international diversification worth it?
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.300]   U.S. stocks make up 60% of global market cap.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.260]   We get 40% of our revenue from the S&P overseas.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.560]   Why do I need international stocks?
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.600]   That's fair.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.820]   And the annual returns for each
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.500]   have been better for the U.S. going back to 1970.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.260]   U.S. stocks are up 10.5% per year in that time.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.380]   International stocks, more like 9%.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.380]   But most of that outperformance has come since 2013,
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.300]   basically, so I looked at this for a blog post recently.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.140]   From 1970 to 2012, annual returns were 9.7% per year
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.260]   for U.S. stocks, 9.6% for international stocks.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.440]   Basically identical.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.620]   U.S. stocks have done so much better,
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.880]   so all their outperformance has come since then.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.300]   I did do a blog post about this,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.140]   so John, throw up my next table.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.940]   I kind of looked at the cyclicality of this.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.380]   Which one wins when?
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.740]   And I cherry-picked the dates here,
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.380]   but you can see U.S. or international stocks
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.860]   outperformed pretty handily in the 1970s.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.060]   Early 1980s, U.S. took the baton.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.100]   Late 1980s, there was a massive outperformance
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.380]   for international stocks, thank you, Japan.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.700]   '90s, the U.S. took it back,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.180]   and then we've gone back and forth since,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.260]   and then the latest period was just a really long cycle
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.120]   of outperformance for U.S., which is 2008 to 2021.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.360]   So I understand why some U.S.-based investors
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.900]   are only comfortable holding U.S. stocks.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.740]   And I think if you do that,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.620]   you're probably gonna be fine over the long term.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.140]   You feel safer, but I don't know.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.900]   Here's one of my favorite all-time charts
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.620]   from Credit Suisse, their year-end returns yearbook,
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.500]   of the relative sizes of world stock markets
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.180]   from 1900 to 2023.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.660]   And I've used this one plenty before,
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.500]   but U.S. was 15% of global stock market in 1900.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.260]   Now they've eaten the rest of the world like Pac-Man,
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.940]   and they're close to 60%.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.100]   The winners write the history book,
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.100]   so it makes sense that we focus so much of our time
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.380]   and energy on U.S. stocks.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.700]   But I don't know, can you guarantee me
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.860]   that the U.S. is gonna do this again?
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.700]   Probably not.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.060]   I don't think they're gonna become 120% of global market cap.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.660]   I don't think it works like that.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.500]   Check my math on that,
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.780]   but I don't think that's how it works.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.820]   But what's to say another country or countries
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.700]   couldn't close this gap this century?
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.180]   I would almost be shocked if they didn't,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.340]   right, if the U.S. didn't become a little smaller
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.260]   and these other countries didn't come up a little more.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.580]   I mean, Great Britain was 24% in 1900.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.820]   They were, you know, like the fall of the Roman Empire here.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.520]   It wouldn't shock me if some other country came up.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.260]   So I think that's the whole point of diversification.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.580]   It's not perfect, but I think spreading your bets
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.860]   between other geographies around the world
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.100]   is sort of more of a risk management tool,
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.700]   even if it doesn't boost returns all that much.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.460]   - Well, and we get this question sometimes
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.620]   from people who are not based in the U.S.,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.620]   not to brag, but we have a pretty big audience,
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.860]   you know, that's international.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.680]   - It's true.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.860]   - We have a listener named Rob
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.260]   who stopped by a while back from Australia,
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.260]   and I was talking to him,
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.300]   and one of the things we were talking about
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.100]   is like what his portfolio looked like versus like mine,
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.420]   right, and he had quite a lot of U.S. exposure, actually,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.300]   but not as much, you know, and yeah,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.860]   he had companies and things that I'd never even heard of
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.700]   or thought about.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.640]   So that's something that's kind of interesting.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.140]   - 2.2%, that's the thing.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.020]   Most other countries have the same home bias that we have,
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.240]   and their stocks, their whole stock market
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.880]   is like the size of Apple, basically.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.340]   So imagine taking your whole portfolio
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.740]   and putting it in Apple and hoping for the best.
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.360]   I think that's the point of spreading your bets globally
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.100]   is that I think it's more of a risk reducer than anything.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.340]   - Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.100]   - All right, do another one.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.840]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Jeff.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.180]   Should I quit using my bank that pays 0.1% interest
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.460]   for my banking and emergency fund
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.860]   and start using a money market fund that earns 4.5%?
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.740]   My wife and I have good job security and higher education
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.780]   and usually invest extra cash or spend it on our young kids
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.380]   rather than sit on a bloated emergency fund earning nothing.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.700]   However, 4.5% is a lot more attractive than 0.1%
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.220]   while money hangs out between paydays
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.700]   and billing cycles, et cetera.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.180]   Appreciate any thoughts.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.540]   - This is a pretty drastic spread here.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.060]   - Yeah, and this is an easy one.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.700]   No one, and I mean, no one should be earning 0.1%
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.540]   on their savings account right now, right?
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.700]   This should be illegal for banks to pay this little.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.000]   Anything under 4% right now is pretty terrible.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.340]   You should be earning somewhere in the four to 5% range,
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.180]   low fives probably at the high end for emergency savings.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.340]   So anything, online savings account, money market,
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.460]   T-bills, CDs, short-term bonds,
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.700]   anything like that is paying four to 5% right now
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.420]   'cause the Fed has jacked up short-term rates.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.260]   Easy decision.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.540]   If a bank is ripping you off and for whatever reason
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.620]   you haven't moved your money,
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.800]   open a new account somewhere else.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.940]   Money will actually earn some income.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.900]   To be fair, I understand why some people
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.940]   maybe are still a little confused
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.100]   about the short-term yield situation
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.580]   if you haven't been paying attention.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.900]   Not everyone pays attention to this stuff
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.740]   every day like we do.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.260]   So John, do a chart on of the three-month T-bills.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.180]   So this is since the start of the turn of the century.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.800]   This is three-month T-bills are a good proxy
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.740]   for what you can earn on your cash
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.420]   and things like savings accounts or money markets.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.100]   Rates were really high in the 1990s,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.540]   five to 6% at the end of the decade there.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.140]   The tech bust happened and rates fell off a cliff,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.940]   getting back down to like 1% for a few years.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.620]   And rates slowly but surely work themselves
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.960]   back up to 5% or so by 2007, 2008.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.060]   2008 financial crisis, we go to zero
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.060]   and are there for like seven years, right?
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.220]   Then we slowly but surely go back up a little bit,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.500]   just over 2% until 2018.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.420]   They go back down a little
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.680]   and then you can see another cliff drop,
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.900]   Wile E. Coyote style in 2020 for the pandemic.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.700]   So we've had this huge roller coaster
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.980]   that goes from up down,
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.020]   but then we sort of level off for a while at zero.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.700]   So I think it makes sense why some people
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.300]   might still think that that 0%
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.020]   is the way that things work,
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.780]   but definitely get your cash yields off the floor.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.340]   Find an account that pays four to 5%.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.580]   But once you get off the zero bound,
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.620]   then don't go chasing yield all the time.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.300]   Like, you know, I'm earning 4.75%,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.240]   but I could be earning five.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.580]   I think just getting off the 0% is the biggest thing there.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.420]   And then probably it's more trouble than it's worth.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.660]   But yes, you have to get off of 0%.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.120]   That's a layup right now.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.540]   - Yeah, I attained five,
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.820]   but I wasn't happy with the process to get me there.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.340]   And it involved a bank collapsing in the process.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.500]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.420]   So make sure your bank's been around
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.460]   for more than like three months, unlike Duncan's,
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.180]   and has a name that doesn't sound like
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.420]   it was made up by Bernie Madoff.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.420]   - Right, yeah, probably good advice.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.260]   - Then you're good.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.460]   But yeah, get off of zero.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.340]   This is the easiest question we'll get today.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.260]   - Cool, yeah, I like that. - Next one.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.220]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Connor.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.860]   I'm finishing my residency training
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.540]   after doing med school and residency
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.020]   for the past seven years.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   So I have about $230,000 in student loan debt.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.420]   However, I'm pursuing public student loan forgiveness,
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.860]   which will forgive my loans in about 6.5 years.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.820]   - You knew that one.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.420]   - I know that one because I've read a lot about that.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.300]   We're in the process of purchasing our first home
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.540]   after being pre-approved for a $600,000 mortgage.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.060]   We only have about $35,000 in cash,
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.540]   but I'm about to start my new job
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.780]   that pays about four times my current income.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.340]   I've heard that physician mortgages,
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.740]   which that's new terminology to me,
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.900]   are great given that they don't require a down payment.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.600]   However, is there any consequence
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.500]   of putting even a little money down
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.500]   towards the down payment,
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.540]   or should I just try to pay extra on the mortgage
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.240]   once I start making more money?
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.340]   We plan to live in this house for five to seven years
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.540]   before we would consider a move.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.940]   All right, 230K, sounds kinda like a lot.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.140]   John, do a chart on here of student loan debt.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.740]   I'm gonna bust some myths here.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.380]   This is from the Brookings Institute.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.460]   2% of all borrowers owe $200,000 or more,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.940]   but they make up 14% of the balance of all student loans.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.820]   Now, if you go to 100K, 6% of borrowers owe 100K or more,
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.620]   but that makes up 1/3 of the entire debt load.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.260]   So obviously, student loans are not,
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.220]   like, it is an issue,
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.700]   but you see these stories about people who went into debt
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.420]   and owe six figures,
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.220]   and maybe they got, like, a philosophy degree
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.380]   that they can't do anything with.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.700]   Most of those people went to med school or law school
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.820]   or getting their master's,
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.500]   and if you were a person who didn't
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.500]   and you got that much debt,
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.940]   then you got some really bad advice, unfortunately.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.580]   - Or they got an MFA that they really didn't need.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.140]   - There you go, yeah, something you didn't need.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.400]   So, obviously, sounds like a lot of money,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.780]   but for a doctor, considering the high income potential,
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.700]   like, you're coming out of residency,
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.500]   this is a good investment.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.820]   It sounds like you're not gonna be paying it anyway, right?
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.660]   So what do you say, Duncan?
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.900]   Public service loan forgiveness?
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.500]   - Oh, yeah. - This is basically,
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.940]   the idea is if you work for some sort of non-profit
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.300]   or the government has to kind of sign off on the place
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.660]   you work, you make 120 consecutive payments,
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.100]   and then your student loans will be forgiven.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.940]   So that's not a bad deal for that high of a debt load.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.700]   So that sounds like you've got that figured out,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.340]   so you're willing to do non-profit work.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.940]   Physician loan, also not a bad deal.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.140]   So the way this works, Duncan,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.020]   is banks know doctors will have a high income,
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.220]   but coming out of residency,
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.420]   they not a high amount of saved money
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.400]   because they were in residency and not earning very much,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.900]   and they have huge debt loads.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.780]   So banks know that this is probably money good,
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.500]   and they're willing to offer this low down payment
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.860]   or no down payment mortgage.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.860]   And so that's not a bad deal,
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.860]   'cause they know they're working with someone
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.260]   who's gonna have a high income, right?
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.700]   So I did some spreadsheeting based
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.860]   on the numbers kind of provided.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.540]   So $600,000 mortgage,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.580]   let's say they go all the way up there
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.420]   since that's what they were pre-approved for.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.140]   I mean, you get a pre-approval range.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.580]   Let's be honest, everyone goes to the high end of the range.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.340]   No one's gonna go to the low end of the range.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.340]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.180]   No money down at 7% mortgage rates,
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.260]   which is what we hit this week,
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.440]   which is ouch, ouch, ouch, 7% mortgage rates.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.160]   That's a monthly payment of around $3,900 and change, right?
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.920]   Almost close to 4,000.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.260]   If you put your full 35,000 in savings as a down payment,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.220]   now we're looking at monthly payments of more like 3,750.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.680]   So you'd say like $240 a month, something like that.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.980]   I don't think the down payment makes sense here.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.500]   It would only be like a 5% or 6% down payment anyway
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.980]   with that much money if you're going to 600K.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.380]   Doesn't really provide you much relief
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.260]   in terms of monthly payments.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.460]   Plus you're gonna have a ton of costs
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.300]   in the moving process,
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.500]   closing costs and moving costs and inspection fees
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.640]   and all this stuff.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.580]   I would hang on to that money for the flexibility of it.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.460]   And if you don't pay it down
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.300]   and you wanna put it back into the mortgage at some point,
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.700]   you can still do that and do a principal payment.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.580]   I guess the biggest consequence of not putting much down
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.340]   is that if the price goes down
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.920]   and you wanna sell or move out,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.180]   then you're gonna have to eat that loss probably.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.660]   But even if, and then 6% in equity
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.020]   gets wiped out fairly quickly if prices fall as well.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.200]   So I prefer the flexibility of that savings on hand
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.580]   as opposed to putting it down,
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.540]   especially if it's such a small down payment.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.700]   If you can just borrow and not have to pay,
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.860]   you can always pay it, like you said,
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.900]   pay it down later once your income gets a little higher.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.020]   My only other comment here is be careful on the temptation
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.380]   to go crazy on lifestyle creep.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.380]   Obviously you've been living like a resident for a while now
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.860]   and four times in your income
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.860]   is gonna feel pretty darn nice.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.220]   But I just say, make sure you don't go
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.380]   completely nuts right away.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.860]   - Can they go like two times their standard of living?
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.820]   - Just build in a decent savings rate once,
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.860]   just because you're used to living like a resident, right?
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.300]   You don't wanna completely just change.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.820]   I would build in like slowly, but surely work into it
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.620]   as opposed to just going nuts right away.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.020]   I also highly recommend the book,
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.620]   "The White Coat Investor" by Jim Dolley.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.880]   He has a podcast by the same name.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.820]   Actually, I was on a few months ago
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.060]   if you wanna try to go find that.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.580]   It's written by a doctor for a doctor.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.380]   It's all about the finances surrounding young doctors
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.540]   and how to build wealth.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.300]   Highly recommended for someone in your situation
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.660]   understand student loans and investing and personal finance
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.660]   and the intricacies of being a doctor and dealing with that.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.780]   And also congrats.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.780]   I cannot imagine the amount of hard work that is involved
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.900]   in going through med school and getting a residency
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.820]   and all that stuff.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.000]   So good for you.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.660]   - I can because I watch "Scrubs."
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.660]   I feel like I have a decent idea.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.860]   - I love that show.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.320]   That is a highly underrated.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.180]   Oh, it was so good.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.680]   I pretend like the last season didn't happen,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.860]   but that is a great show.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.180]   - Yeah, and Zach Braff was on the "Rich Roll" podcast
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.140]   recently, it was great.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.980]   It was good.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.900]   - They don't make 'em like that anymore.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.420]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.940]   - All right, up next we have a question.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.060]   Is this one, is this from Chris?
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.380]   Yep, this one is from Chris.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.820]   "Not to brag, my wife and I--"
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.420]   - So not to brag of the week, big time.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.820]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.140]   "Not to brag, my wife and I acquired a $1 million,
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.540]   "1,000 square foot condo in the Boston area
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.420]   "when rates were less than 3% with 20% down
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.260]   "due to an unexpected liquidity event."
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.780]   That sounds like an early 2000s band.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.040]   I don't know, but.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.660]   "Due to an unexpected liquidity event,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.440]   "we can afford to pay off the mortgage in full.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.180]   "However, this seems foolish to do

[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.720]   "We have discussed the possibility of starting a family
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.420]   "in the next five years and would need to increase

[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.860]   - All right, yeah, easily wins the order for not to brag.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.220]   Let's bring in someone who has experience
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   in both financial planning and the Boston real estate market.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.380]   Benny Markets, AKA Ben Coulthard.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.660]   - Benjamin C. Markets.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.120]   - So Ben, I was in Boston, I guess last year,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.680]   and visited you, and you kind of mentioned
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.800]   the real estate market or the rental market there
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.120]   is a little pricey, so I want to hear your thoughts.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.160]   John, first throw up the Case-Shiller of Boston.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.400]   I want to ask for your thoughts on this.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.180]   So this is the last 10 years,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.720]   Case-Shiller National Home Price Index
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.240]   versus Boston Home Price Index.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.560]   Boston has fallen behind nationally in the last few years.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.200]   That actually surprises me.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.680]   I'm sure there are neighborhoods that have done much better,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.320]   but what do you think about this being a Boston guy?
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.680]   - Yeah, it's fallen behind, but it is still not great, Bob.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.420]   I chose this question for a few reasons.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.380]   So yeah, number one, he starts with not to brag.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.060]   Chris, I know you're a real one.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.380]   I see you, and frankly, if anyone is not aware
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.900]   of that reference, they should subscribe
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.640]   to Animal Spirits Pod.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.620]   Number two, yes, Boston guy.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.220]   I'm in the town right now, Charlestown,
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.740]   for those who don't know.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.020]   My friend's cousin is Ben Affleck's sister's brother-in-law.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.540]   That's actually not true, but my fellow Bostonians
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.480]   go to the front of the line.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.720]   The last reason, this is the easiest damn question
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.960]   out of the 150 in the Q bank, all right?
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.280]   You basically answered it yourself,
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.480]   and I do respect that he's asking it
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.080]   because it's a huge decision, right?
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.800]   Like, even if you're 95% sure,
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.400]   it's still good to bounce it off an objective third party.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.240]   - Wait, wait, wait, hang on.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.200]   I don't think it's as easy as you think.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.400]   So you think, so what is your answer?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.240]   Let's hear it.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.680]   I don't think it's as easy as you think.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.920]   - For one, yeah, I'm in a similar boat as Chris.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.360]   So like me and my soonish-to-be fiancee, not to brag,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.440]   at least I think, we rent this charming trash heap
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.240]   and are half looking to buy a place.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.200]   But because interest rates have doubled
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.080]   since our man Chris locked in
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.720]   that beautiful 3% interest rate,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.880]   not only can I not afford to buy in Charlestown or Cambridge,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.360]   I can barely afford a piece of dog shit
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.640]   stuck to the bottom of my shoe in Medford, all right?
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.520]   I want Chris to view this sub-3% mortgage,
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.200]   which I assume is locked in for the long run,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.340]   as the best freaking investment he has ever made in his life.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.460]   Like it's literally like more traffic.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.060]   - How much is he gonna, to break even
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.800]   on a thousand square foot apartment at a million dollars,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.200]   he's gonna have to get like what, $4,500 a month,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.280]   $5,000 a month?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.760]   Is that doable?
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.240]   - Well, yeah, I was gonna get to the rental,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.280]   I was gonna get to the rental thing,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.920]   but like going back to the investment,
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.500]   like this asset on this mortgage rate
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.200]   is literally more beneficial to him
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.720]   than if he put 20K in NVIDIA in 2009.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.120]   Like I wouldn't-- - I agree, hang onto it.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.160]   - I would challenge Chris to a duel to the death
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   for a chance to take his mortgage.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.400]   And he's gotta cherish it-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.440]   Yeah, come on, man. - To quote the great
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.540]   Billy Madison. - Whoa, aggressive.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.120]   - Obviously, these people are as late 20s, early 30s,
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.000]   they're in an unbelievable spot.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.480]   I don't know if it was an inheritance or stock options
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.120]   or what, how they got the money,
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.580]   but the fact that they could,
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.440]   they have the ability to either pay down this mortgage,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.160]   which was what, 800 grand,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.060]   or use it on something else in Cambridge,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.800]   which I guess is a nice spot to,
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.680]   either way, they're probably going to be fine.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.200]   My only concern would be,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.960]   you hold on to the other one as a rental
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.140]   and you buy this new one,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.080]   are you overextending yourself in Massachusetts real estate
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.440]   in terms of concentration?
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.720]   - Right, so there's that and like, yeah,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.920]   if we don't know the dollar amounts
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.640]   and like what exactly is going on
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.460]   in the overall financial plan,
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.880]   that's why plans are important,
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.520]   it's hard to like say definitely.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.160]   So I noticed one thing, it says that,
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.280]   it sounds like the vision for the starting a family
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.600]   is still a few years away.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.500]   Like, you know, interest rates have doubled,
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.560]   the home prices have hardly budged.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.000]   I'm not a market timer guy,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.540]   but like probably not the most glorious time
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.960]   to take on a big mortgage
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.800]   if you don't absolutely have to.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.720]   - That I agree with it.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.420]   Yeah, they have some time to wait things out.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.260]   They're not in a,
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.280]   they don't have to be in a hurry to move
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.420]   and they can put this money into T-bills
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.940]   or something while they wait.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.980]   - Right, and the rental thing too,
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.140]   like, yeah, it'd be great to rent that other one out
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.380]   and ship it on the new monthly payments,
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.500]   but like being a landlord isn't zero work.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.540]   Like, you'll probably have to deal
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.860]   with some 23-year-old punk
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.020]   who's like spilling natty lights on your hardwood floor
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.860]   and like flicking boogers on the walls.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.260]   10 months later, you're gonna have to find another one
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.340]   of those 23-year-old punks.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.340]   Like, it's not like as easy as passive income, you know?
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.340]   - Yes, I agree.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.180]   So--
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.620]   - I just learned in the chat too
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.600]   that Cambridge is actually a town.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.700]   I've been there, I've been to Harvard's campus before.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.280]   I thought that that was just like a neighborhood of Boston.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.560]   - Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.380]   It's where I would want to raise a family, frankly.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.980]   But yeah, like back to the like living situation,
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.860]   like despite the liquidity, like if I were him,
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.940]   I would just, I would enjoy the city,
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.220]   particularly enjoy that sub 3% mortgage,
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.620]   and then, you know, park the liquidity in a T-bill,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.340]   like maybe half, you know,
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.900]   the amount to lock in a five-handle
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.860]   and then, you know, put the rest in like a money market
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.500]   or a high yield with a four-handle.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.860]   Clip thousands in yields, you know--
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.700]   - Taking time.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.820]   - You're doing nothing until you're ready
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.700]   for that big purchase.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.340]   - Either way, they're in a pretty good position,
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.160]   but you're right.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.540]   Laying down the 3% mortgage early
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.980]   is especially when you can get five in a T-bill.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.420]   There's no reason for that right now.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.580]   It makes no sense.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.120]   - Exactly.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.960]   - Perfect.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.780]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.020]   - Cool.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.860]   Okay.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.700]   By the way--
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.680]   - You're not bitter about the Boston real estate market,
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.520]   right?
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.340]   Just making sure.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.580]   - Yeah, I am not bullish on the Boston.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.900]   Well, I just think like, yeah, as you would say,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.740]   you could drive a truck through the bid-ask spread.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.460]   Everyone's hanging out in their 3% mortgages
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.140]   and like people like myself's affordability
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:23.980]   got cut in half.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.220]   So it's just, yeah, it's a stalemate right now.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.060]   - All right.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.820]   All right, last but not least,
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.320]   let's do a question from Owen.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.300]   Is it a good idea to start children
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.240]   off with a financial planner or advisor
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.000]   so they develop good financial habits
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.740]   and understand the power of investing?
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.620]   What about when they turn 18?
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.200]   Also on this, this is like a very nubile question,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.960]   but maybe just explain the difference
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.040]   in a financial planner and advisor
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.920]   if there is one for our young viewers
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.760]   who might not know that.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.280]   - That's basically the same thing.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.040]   - Yeah, tomato, tomato there.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.060]   - You see people always kind of like say one or the other,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:00.900]   so I was just curious.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.240]   - And some people spell advisor with an E,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.080]   some do it with an O.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.120]   I don't know why.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.680]   - I know, I'm an O guy, big time.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.560]   - I'm a big advisor guy.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.720]   - Yeah, I'm an advisor.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.520]   - I mean, my gut response is no,
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.280]   I don't think there's any reason as an 18 year old
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.120]   that you need a financial advisor,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.040]   but maybe you can talk about like how to better your life
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.840]   as a young person financially.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.260]   I mean, almost like a financial life coach,
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.080]   but there's just, yeah, financial advisor, no.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   - Yeah, that's my answer too.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.700]   Like, even if his teenage daughter
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.440]   already had two commas in her account,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.000]   I'd say that she really just needs like a few ETFs
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.400]   and maybe a good CPA, but I get this one a lot,
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.960]   and I wanna start like broadly.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.800]   - In terms of like clients ask you,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.100]   do my kids need an advisor basically?
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.400]   - Yeah, I mean, there's 35 year olds
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.520]   who don't need an advisor,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.280]   and there's 85 year olds who don't need an advisor.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.100]   It's not like, I think of it as like
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.880]   when your brain is starting to cry uncle,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.120]   and crying uncle comes in different forms.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.200]   It's, oh my God, we just had a baby.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.020]   Like, I don't even have time to deal with this anymore.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.340]   It's, I got a promotion and had a baby.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.200]   I don't even know how I'm gonna deal with all this,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.600]   or it's exiting a small business,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.400]   starting a small business, equity comp payday,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.720]   inheritance, like really any kind of like OMFG moment.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.800]   - It's a life event or your financial situation
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.720]   becomes so complex,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.600]   or you just don't have the time to deal with it
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.360]   that you need to outsource to someone else.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.440]   - Correct, correct.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.800]   It's, yeah, you said it, outsource your brain power,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.920]   your time, and or your anxiety to a third party.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.960]   Like that's the time.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.040]   So this does vary for everyone.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.060]   It's just, it's not a dollar or like an age threshold.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.140]   It is a time or complexity threshold.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.000]   So back to Owen's daughter,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.640]   maybe if she was a freshman at Harvard
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.360]   writing algorithms on her dorm room window,
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.840]   and about to drop out to become the founder
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.760]   of the social network,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.340]   then she might be at a complexity threshold
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.880]   that would warrant an advisory service.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.480]   By the way, Jesse Eisenberg is more Mark Zuckerberg to me
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.320]   than Zuck himself.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.440]   Like Jesse is Mark.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.120]   - He's a much better Mark, yeah.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.400]   - So he's so much better than Mark.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.680]   But I think like Owen's question
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.820]   was more about like giving his daughter wisdom
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.080]   and setting her on the right path.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.320]   And for that, I do have a few ideas.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.240]   Option one, if you, Owen, have an advisor
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.480]   and they aren't willing to spend
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   like the occasional 30 minutes with her,
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.520]   like I do with my clients' children,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.920]   then might I suggest firing they ass.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.280]   Like if they can't fit that in,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.520]   then either your family isn't enough of a priority
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.400]   or they don't have any capacity, which both aren't great.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   Option two, there are hybrid human robo advisors that exist.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.840]   One of which is ours, it's called Liftoff.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.360]   This type of service is great for someone
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.200]   who doesn't really know where to start.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.760]   Like maybe they need to talk to someone once in a while,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.680]   certainly be better off
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.360]   without a Robin Hood type portfolio.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   And if she wants to start with a hundred bucks,
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   myself, one of the other four advisors
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.660]   who oversee that platform would be happy to chat with her.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.760]   My last idea, I actually kind of got this
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.960]   from TCAF last week, from Chris Davis,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.360]   who does this with his nieces and nephews.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.040]   I think incentivizing her to read
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.000]   a great beginner investment book is where I'd start.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.360]   Like I wouldn't expect her to crack open
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.840]   the intelligent investor on her own just for fun.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.560]   But maybe be like, "Hey, money is really important in life.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.600]   "I'll reward you with a hundred bucks
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.440]   "if you read this book
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.360]   "and tell me three things that you learned."
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.760]   Like that might light the spark
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.640]   and maybe she even chooses to invest a hundred bucks.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.480]   You never know.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.240]   - Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.660]   Get 'em on the right path.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.720]   And the thing is, as a parent,
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.920]   that's almost your job at that point, at 18.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.760]   - Right. - Right?
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.680]   Unless they have a complex financial situation
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.160]   and you're talking to them about a trust
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.000]   they're gonna inherit someday,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.240]   or they have a job right away
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.680]   that's gonna pay them a lot of money,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   it's probably just trying to instill in them
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.240]   some good habits if they haven't gotten them yet.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.040]   But that's, yeah, as a parent,
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.520]   that's probably your job at that point.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.480]   - Yeah, another good option, have 'em watch "The Compound."
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.200]   You know, get 'em started young.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.000]   More like toddlers watching "The Compound."
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.920]   - Send us a, yeah, send us your address.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.480]   I'll send you a couple of copies of my book.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.320]   - I don't even expect,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.800]   I was gonna ask you, smarter Ben,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.680]   like what do you think is the best beginner book
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.520]   to start with?
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.960]   Like I think of Morgan Housel's "The Psychology of Money."
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.840]   I think maybe "Money Game" by Adam Smith.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.320]   And frankly, like I think like you and Majuli's books
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.400]   are maybe like closer to 201 instead of 101, you know?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.720]   - Yeah, that's when you're like in the working world.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.560]   And yeah, 'cause 18,
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.320]   you still have a lot of this stuff ahead of you.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.720]   But yeah, that's the cool thing is these days,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   I'm guessing most kids don't even like books anymore.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.400]   They want podcasts, or they want, you know, blog posts,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.320]   or they probably want something that's easier to digest.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.120]   So maybe that's the way to get 'em is, you know,
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.480]   listen to a couple of finance podcasts
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.240]   and figure out the kind of thing
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.080]   that works for you in that.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.960]   And just get interested.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.920]   I think that's the point,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.080]   is just getting interested in this stuff from a young age
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.940]   to kind of understand that someday this money stuff
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.360]   is going to be important for me.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.760]   - I think Michael Lewis books are great
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.640]   for just general interest in like business
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.120]   and tangential kind of investing stuff.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.200]   - Don't read "The Big Short."
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.940]   No, do not read "The Big Short."
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.760]   - I'm already thinking "Flash Boys."
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.120]   "Flash Boys" is one of my favorite.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.920]   That one made it like really fun.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.720]   - I think "The Big Short" probably lost more money
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.940]   than people lost in the housing market in 2008
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.340]   because people thought they could short stuff
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.920]   and predict the end of the world.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.320]   But no, but you're right.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.240]   He's good, Doug.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.080]   But yeah, I agree.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.360]   Just getting the interest in them is,
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.120]   and maybe you could do it together, right?
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.280]   And better understand and put on animal spirits
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.840]   every Wednesday morning when you're driving them to school.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.200]   - Yeah, and pay her a hundred bucks to do it too.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.560]   It'll be better money spent than, you know,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.140]   whatever else.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.820]   - Yes, but yeah, not easy.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.760]   Great question.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.240]   - Lots of good ones today.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.760]   - Yes, Ben, last time I saw you,
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   you were looking through your DraftKings profile,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.160]   betting on every NBA game.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.420]   I just wanna make sure we're right-sizing those positions
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.760]   and we're not using a future down payment
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.000]   on a Boston 300 square foot, right?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.880]   - Yes, yes, we're not.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.600]   I would say overall, things are going weak to quite weak.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.560]   I mean, my performance is correlated to Boston sports,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.660]   which used to be a great thing,
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.400]   but now we're overvalued.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   - So you have a home country bias in your gambling?
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.040]   - Massive home country bias.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.080]   And I mean, the Celtics, they just can't get it done.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.240]   They've peaked.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.640]   Like the second that Grant Williams
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.160]   got in Jimmy Butler's face in game two,
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.360]   I could see the $50 series bet that I had on them
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.960]   just evaporate before my eyes.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.160]   - At least you're right-sizing your positions though.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.400]   $50 is fine. - Right, exactly.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.920]   I do have a few more nuggets of wisdom.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.040]   So even if you pick a winner,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.600]   and this goes for investments too,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.760]   you'll never be satisfied.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.180]   You'll wish you had put more.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.040]   I took Jon Rahm to win the Masters at plus 850,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.340]   meaning if you put a hundred bucks, you get paid out 850.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.400]   Too bad I only put $5 on it.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   Like you're just never gonna be satisfied.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.040]   You get overconfident, you bet more,
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.760]   and then you get whacked.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.400]   - That's why you don't put your whole paychecks
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.680]   into sports gambling, right?
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.520]   - Exactly.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.960]   I stand by that it's a great reminder.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.240]   It's a great distraction
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.120]   from the actual bulk of your investments.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.460]   75% of my net worth is in index funds.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.360]   15 is in BIL for a down payment.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   Maybe 9% is in individual stocks like Nvidia,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.440]   which again, I put a thousand into Nvidia in 2017.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.100]   I can't even enjoy the 12X
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.140]   'cause I'm just pissed about how little I put into it.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.780]   Like even if you win, you're still upset.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.760]   So whatever, I just drive myself insane
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.500]   with a tiny portion. - Not to brag.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.940]   - And you know, let the rest is gravy.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.900]   - Give yourself a back-headed compliment.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.900]   - Yeah, I love it.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.720]   - That's right.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.560]   And guess what?
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.740]   I will say I'm taking the nuggets to win the championship.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.100]   Jokic doing this stuff from Three Point Line.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.380]   Yeah, they're probably gonna sell it a premium,
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.500]   but I'm taking them.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.140]   - All right, don't quit your day job.
