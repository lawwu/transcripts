[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.000]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in chapter 8, reading from verse 14 to verse 17.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.120]   From verse 14 to verse 17, in the eighth chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.880]   This as most of you will realize and remember comes as a kind of sequel to what we are told
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.680]   in the earlier part of the chapter.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.200]   And there, as we have been seeing on a number of Sunday nights, we have been given an account
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.840]   of how the Gospel first began to spread from Jerusalem down to Samaria and amongst the
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840]   Samaritans.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.160]   A very important turning point in the history of the Christian Church.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.680]   The history of the Church shows a number of great turning points.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.760]   And this was the first great turning point in many ways, when the Gospel ceased to be
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.240]   something only for Jews and for Jerusalem in particular, but began to spread amongst
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.240]   the Samaritans, other countries, other parts of the world, and eventually throughout the
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.240]   whole world.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.880]   Well now, we have been considering that.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.840]   And the record tells us how it was very largely as the result of the preaching of this one
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.240]   man, Philip, who was an evangelist and a deacon in the Church.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.360]   He had preached Christ, he had preached the Kingdom of God to them, and they had believed
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.480]   Philip preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.900]   and were baptized, both men and women.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.440]   And as we were seeing last Sunday night, the result of this was that there was great joy
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.040]   in that city.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   But still, you see, it is not the end of the story.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.240]   Something further happened to them, and that is the thing which is described to us in these
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.000]   verses 14 to 17.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.720]   Here we are told that when the apostles, who as we have been told earlier, were left in
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.920]   Jerusalem, when most of the common people, the Christians, were scattered abroad because
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.720]   of the persecution, when these apostles remaining in Jerusalem had heard this astounding thing
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.240]   that the Gospel had been preached and received amongst the people in Samaria, they sent down
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.360]   Peter and John to see what had happened to confirm the work.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.640]   But having arrived, we are told this further thing, that they prayed for these people who
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.380]   had already believed the Gospel and had become Christians.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.360]   They prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost, and having prayed, they laid
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.080]   their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.520]   Now, this is the most important statement.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.600]   Here is a statement, here is a text, if you like, which raises for us what in many ways
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   is the most fundamental of all questions facing the human race.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.960]   What is that question?
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.320]   Well, I would say that the ultimate question that we have all got to consider and face
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.600]   is this, is there anything apart from this world?
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.680]   Is this the only world?
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.880]   Is there a supernatural realm?
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.560]   Is there a world of the Spirit, which we don't see?
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.440]   Now, this, I say, is the great and fundamental question.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.980]   There are many other questions, and it is right that we should consider them.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.960]   But I do feel that a great deal of time is often being wasted at the present time over
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.040]   this whole question of the Christian faith.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   You hear these discussions and debates, and it seems to me that it is mostly and chiefly
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.680]   a waste of time for this reason, that they haven't faced the first fundamental question.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.920]   And this is the first fundamental question.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:11.900]   Is there such a thing as a supernatural realm, greater, above, and beyond this world?
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.660]   Now, the whole message of the Bible is to say that there is.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.900]   The whole message of the Bible is really this, is to say that God is over all, that it is
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   this God who has existed from all eternity, who made and created this world in which we
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.220]   live, and man, and that he has not only created the world, but that he sustains it and orders
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.420]   it, and that you cannot understand what has happened in the world except in terms of him.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.860]   Now, that is the great case of the Bible.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.580]   Of course, it puts it in endless ways and forms.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.780]   But our trouble so often is that we miss the wood because of the trees, and people get
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.340]   bogged down with different details.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:07.020]   Here is the big thing that the Bible asserts, that this visible world of ours is the result
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.740]   of the invisible, and that it is the invisible that matters primarily, and that you'll rarely
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.220]   only understand the visible when you know something about the invisible.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.540]   Now, I think you'll agree with me that this is the great question.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.380]   So I use having particular arguments about our Lord's person and miracles and various
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.260]   other things if you already deny entirely and in total the whole of the supernatural
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.700]   realm.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.380]   So I say this is the first great fundamental question, and it's raised for us in an acute
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:50.020]   manner by this story of what happened in Samaria when these two apostles, Peter and John, went
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.820]   down and laid their hands on these people after having prayed for them, and they received
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.820]   the Holy Ghost.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.820]   Now, let's look at this together.
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.620]   Here, you see, is a great assertion of the supernatural.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.540]   Now this is the thing that is being questioned, and it's being questioned in two main ways.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.820]   The first is by what is called humanism, this thing about which we are hearing so much at
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.820]   the present time.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   They're trying to advertise it.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.500]   They're deliberately going in for an advertising campaign, and the authorities in the papers
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.820]   and on the television and radio are very glad, of course, to help them, as usual.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.540]   They're doing their best to try and get the thing going.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.580]   Now, what does humanism tell us?
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.940]   Well, humanism is a teaching which says that there is nothing outside and beyond this present
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:51.140]   world, and that man is the greatest being in the universe, and that there is nothing
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:58.540]   outside him, that man is the center of the universe and the greatest power in the universe.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.580]   Recently, we've been told that the whole trouble is that man doesn't realize that.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.820]   He should realize that he is a god and that he can control life.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.860]   He's a bit reluctant, says this great authority, to realize his own innate powers, but man
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.180]   is able, we are told, to create and to do anything he likes if he only realized it.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.460]   Man is the center of everything, and we are told that nothing is to be believed which
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.660]   man's reason cannot understand and accept.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:37.540]   Nothing is to be believed unless it can be checked and proved and verified by scientific
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540]   experimentation.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.580]   Now, that is the position of what is called humanism.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.660]   It denies the supernatural realm altogether.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.180]   There is no god, there never has been.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.580]   There is no such thing as miracle.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:01.380]   There is no intervention from the outside in the affairs of this world.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:07.220]   It is all this world, and it is all in the control of man.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.820]   And they say the tragedy of the ages has been that man hasn't realized this, but in his
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.500]   fear and in his ignorance, he has believed in some unseen powers and forces.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.460]   The sooner the better he forgets all that and takes charge of the world which belongs
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.780]   to him and exercises these tremendous powers that he's already got within him.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.020]   That is what is called humanism.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.860]   Well, I don't want to spend our evening on this, but I've got to mention this, because
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.220]   you see, this is the reason why so many people are not Christians.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.060]   They reject the whole of the teaching.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.560]   Indeed, they reject the whole of the Bible.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.500]   They just say that they don't accept its facts.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.540]   Or they try to explain them away in terms of psychology.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:58.220]   Now, let me for a moment just look at this contention before I show you the answer that
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.700]   is given here and in the Bible itself.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.140]   There are many answers that can be given to this humanism, this modern teaching, which
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.420]   of course ultimately is not modern at all.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.940]   You read the 14th Psalm, and there you'll find the first verse is this, "The fool hath
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.500]   said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   That was a humanist, a way back probably ten centuries before the birth of the Lord
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   Jesus Christ.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.140]   It isn't new, of course, at all, but you get these fashions and vogues and phases.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.140]   But there it is.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.140]   What's the answer?
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.940]   Well, there are so many answers, but one answer which I feel is almost sufficient in itself
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.940]   is this.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.760]   Here is a most arrogant teaching that tells us that the greatest minds that the centuries
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.140]   have ever known have all been wrong and have all been deluded fools.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:53.660]   Here is a teaching which tells us that all these mighty teachers, not only in the church,
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.700]   but those who didn't have office in the church, men who have been Christian men, I've
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.740]   often given you their names from this pulpit, starting, if you like, with the great Apostle
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.740]   Paul and the great Saint Augustine, coming down the centuries to the great reformers
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.700]   and others, some of the greatest statesmen and others.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.160]   All these men who believed in God and in Christ and in the supernatural.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.620]   Here we are told they were all fools, in spite of their great ability and the great benefactions
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.860]   which they have given to the world.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.280]   But not only that.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.580]   This teaching which tells us that nothing is to be believed except that which can be
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:38.360]   proved by scientific experimentation is so patently wrong.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.780]   Probably the greatest and the most important things in life are things that are not subject
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.340]   to scientific proof.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.740]   Have you ever been in love?
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.660]   Can you test it by scientific experiment?
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.980]   Can you give reasons why you love one person and not another?
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.020]   Of course you can't.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.620]   You see, these great things, the highest experiences of mankind, forgetting the gospel for the
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:08.640]   moment, all our highest and deepest experiences are outside the realm of scientific investigation.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.600]   And so it seems to me that that argument is totally inadequate even at that point.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.680]   No, no, we need to say to this modern generation, there are more things in heaven and earth
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.080]   for racial than are dreamt of in your philosophies.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.560]   Stop for a moment and think, and you'll see how utterly inadequate human reason is
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.640]   to explain some of the profoundest experiences in life.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.240]   But not only that.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:42.800]   This is a teaching which gives us no explanation whatsoever of the origin of this world.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   It has no explanation.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   But you see, evolution explains it, evolution does not explain it.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:57.000]   Because the theory of evolution has to start by supposing that there was something in existence,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   but it doesn't tell you where that came from.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.080]   Quite apart from the fact that its explanation of what happened to that origin or whatever
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.440]   it was, if it were mere gases or anything else, it doesn't explain how it's happened.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.360]   But it doesn't explain the origin, it doesn't know.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.200]   It can put forward theories, it can't prove them.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.080]   It breaks down at its own evaluation.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:23.000]   The theory of evolution is not subject to scientific experimentation.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.480]   You just can't do it, because you always start with matter.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.080]   So here you are with the primary question of where has the world come from, where has
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   man come from, and you've got nothing but a theory which cannot be subject to experimentation.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.240]   You can't go back to the beginning.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.120]   Nobody was there, nobody knows, so they're having to rest on a theory.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.340]   But according to their own argument, you shouldn't do that.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.640]   You should only believe and accept that which you can prove.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:04.080]   Now there's another one, but you see, on this idea even man himself can't be explained.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:10.760]   Take the study of mankind, take what is called anthropology.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:21.280]   Its evidence is that mankind everywhere has a belief in a supreme being, a supreme God.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.720]   The sense of God is universal in mankind, everywhere, throughout the world.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   It's there.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.560]   When man is born with it, he has to fight against it, he has to try to prove it's wrong.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   It asserts itself.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.240]   Why does it do so?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:42.520]   Why this notion, this idea of an ultimate supreme being?
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.280]   This humanism doesn't begin to explain that, not only that.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   Look at civilization.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:55.880]   Civilization is really man's attempt to deal with his world and with his problems apart
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.160]   from God.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   Look at it as it applies itself in terms of education and all these things.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.240]   And look at its obvious failure.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.520]   You see, the world has been grappling with itself and its problem for so long.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.360]   They turn to us and they say, "Look at your Christianity, it's been preached for two
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.200]   thousand years, why doesn't it put the world right?"
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.280]   Our answer is, of course, is that it's never claimed that it would do that.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.840]   It's not come to do that, except in its way.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.160]   But let me take the argument and put it back.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.920]   What are the achievements of civilization?
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.600]   What are the achievements of this twentieth century civilization?
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.680]   Look round and about you and you get your answer.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.240]   There is man trusting to himself.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.760]   He's been doing it especially for the last hundred years, and look what he's produced.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.560]   But you see, it doesn't begin to explain that.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.160]   Is man merely an intellect?
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.200]   No, no.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.840]   Man is complex.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.960]   The problem of man is this extraordinary contradiction that is in him.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.920]   There is so much that is noble and good and excellent in him, but there is so much that
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.800]   is low and vile and cruel and ugly.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.000]   Man is a great contradiction.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.880]   He advances in the realm of his mind and its mental achievements, and at the same time
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.500]   he is re-progressing in the realm of his morals.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.980]   Look at this present civilization of ours.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.880]   You see it generally on the front page of your popular newspapers, some astounding scientific
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.320]   discovery and then some account of some of these people who want to go back to the jungle
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:44.000]   and are imitating primitive dances and howling and shouting as if they were primitive savages.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.120]   At the same time, educated people doing that and doing the various other things that we
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.040]   were considering when we were taking the case of Simon Magus and his influence upon these
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.760]   Samaritans a few Sunday nights ago.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.400]   Now, I say that you have got to explain this astounding contradiction in men, the high
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:11.160]   and the low, the advance and the re-progression, and in terms of just having men as the judge
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.920]   of all things, you have no adequate explanation.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.960]   So there are some obvious reasons why we don't accept this humanistic teaching, but above
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:29.680]   and beyond all that I say, there is this message of this book which we call the Bible, which
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:37.360]   as I want to show you, simply cannot be explained at all if man is the biggest being in the
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   universe.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:44.400]   Now there is one of these oppositions to the great case of the Bible which tells us that
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.000]   God is there and that God is intervening in the affairs of men, and that it is God's
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.400]   intervention in the world of men that gives men any hope at all in the world at the present
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.000]   time.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   But I must just mention the second way in which this objection to this teaching comes
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.320]   in, and this is what is called deism.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:12.880]   I've got to mention it because this is often misunderstood for Christianity.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.040]   You know there are people who say, "I'm not a humanist, I believe in God.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.440]   I believe in a creator."
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.920]   But they tell us that they believe that God created the world and that afterwards he just
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.700]   left it to himself.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.300]   You know the famous illustration.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.720]   They say God is like a watchmaker.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.520]   The watchmaker makes the watch, he then winds it up and he puts it down and it goes on,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.480]   he doesn't interfere with it any further.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   That is their view of God's relationship to this universe.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.720]   They agree that God is and that God has made the universe, but they say, having set it
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.340]   on its course, he doesn't interfere with it at all.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:59.680]   They deny the miraculous, they deny the incarnation of the Son of God, they believe that men should
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.400]   be religious, that God having made him, he should try to live to the glory of God and
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.800]   obey God, but there is no intervention on the part of God.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.480]   God doesn't come in and do things.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.680]   God has made men, it is now for men to do everything and he's left to himself to do
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.440]   everything, to save himself or to fail to do so.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.840]   Now you notice that though there is that one difference about belief in God, in reality
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.400]   the two positions virtually come to the same thing, and this is the thing that I'm concerned
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.840]   about.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.680]   Is there a God?
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.960]   Does God intervene in the life of this world?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.120]   Are we left to ourselves solely, utterly, and completely?
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.960]   Is there any point in prayer?
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.640]   Is there anything that I can look forward to as salvation coming into this world?
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:01.040]   Now these are the great questions, and this, as I say, is the great case that is made by
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.720]   the Bible.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   The Bible puts this before us in two forms.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:15.280]   Its teaching, but still more important in many ways, is the history that's in the Bible,
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.800]   the facts that are recorded in the Bible, and the explanation of those facts.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.700]   Now let me put it to you.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.000]   What is the teaching of the Bible?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.600]   Well, in its essence it's this.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:36.760]   It is the teaching about God, and it tells us that there are three blessed persons in
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   this Godhead.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:44.760]   God the Father, the Creator, the Almighty Creator of all things that are.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:51.320]   In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and all that in them is.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:20:00.520]   God the Creator, God the Sustainer, God who ordains and controls the affairs of the world
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.520]   and of mankind.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:08.840]   Now this is, in its essence, the great thing that is emphasized in the Old Testament.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.680]   And here it seems to me, you see, is the argument that is being so much ignored at the present
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.760]   time.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:23.480]   The great story of the Jews is in itself to me the complete answer, both to humanism and
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   to deism.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.000]   Read the story of the Old Testament.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.760]   You can confirm it by your secular history books, because the nation of the Jews is a
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.280]   fact of history.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.800]   And the history that is recorded in the Old Testament is not only the biblical history,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.080]   but it is also secular history.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.120]   How did the Jews ever come into being?
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.480]   How do you explain the story of that people?
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.880]   Everything that happened to them that is recorded in the Old Testament, indeed everything that
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.920]   has happened to them since then, how do you explain this?
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:06.240]   And I suggest to you that there is only one adequate explanation, and that is God.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.480]   That was their only explanation.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.000]   They couldn't explain themselves in any other way, and their history shows that it
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.480]   is true, because they were a small nation, and they were often a very foolish people.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.720]   And they were nothing in comparison with some of the great dynasties and empires that surrounded
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.320]   them, and they would undoubtedly have been crushed and destroyed time without number
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.040]   were it not that God had intervened.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.880]   The Bible, the Old Testament, is a record of the constant interventions of God in a
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.800]   miraculous manner for the deliverance of his people.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:45.640]   You have got to face the facts of the Jews, the nation of Israel, and all their strange
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.640]   vicissitudes.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   Now, I am putting these things very broadly this evening in order that I may give you
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.760]   a comprehensive case and argument.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:03.520]   But much more important than that is what we find here, central to the whole biblical
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:10.160]   message, the coming of God the Son into this world.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.800]   Now, we wouldn't be here tonight but for that.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   You see, in that Old Testament there is this constant prophecy about some great one who
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   is to come.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.360]   Well, then the New Testament tells us he has come.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.960]   The appearing on the field of history of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.680]   Now, here is my challenge to all who call themselves humanists or deists or anything
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.520]   else they may like to call themselves.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.680]   The phenomenon of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   Look at him.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   He belongs to history.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.440]   History, the world that doesn't believe in him has to acknowledge that.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   1967.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.720]   I have often pointed this out.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.040]   You don't begin to understand human history apart from this person.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.320]   He has controlled history.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:03.740]   As the hymn puts it, "In the cross of Christ thy glory, towering o'er the wrecks of time."
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.820]   You can't understand the history of the world apart from this person.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.380]   He has divided history.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.880]   He has controlled it.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.920]   And the most momentous things in the history of the human race have been the direct result
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.400]   of the coming of this person into this world.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.880]   So look at his person.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.320]   Look at his teaching.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.000]   Look at his death upon the cross on Galilee's Hill.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.160]   Look at his resurrection.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.560]   Look at what he said after his resurrection.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   Look at his ascension.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.600]   Now, these are sheer facts of history.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.960]   There would never have been a Christian church but for these facts.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   This isn't theory.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960]   It doesn't claim to be.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.280]   It is historical fact.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.160]   Now this book of Acts, that's why we are dealing with it, is a book of Acts.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.160]   It's a book of facts.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   It's a book of history.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.360]   And the whole case that is made by these early preachers is, "We are witnesses of these
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.360]   things."
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.680]   Peter could turn to those men on the Day of Pentecost, as you noticed in the reading.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.400]   He says, "You know these things.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.360]   You've seen them."
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.560]   He was appealing to their own senses, scientific verification.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.960]   Here it was.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.640]   They'd seen these things.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.920]   They'd seen this person.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.720]   He's not telling them a fairy tale.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.840]   He's telling them about someone whom they'd seen and had known and had heard, whose miracles
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.200]   they'd witnessed, whose death they'd witnessed.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.800]   They're witnesses.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.280]   So you see, you've got to look at these things.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.960]   God the Son, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.360]   He has a phenomenon.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.200]   You can't explain him in terms of evolution.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.680]   You can't explain him in terms of civilization.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.000]   He breaks all the rules, as Isaiah says in his 53rd chapter.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.200]   He's a root out of a dry ground.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.360]   You can't explain his origins.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.240]   You can't explain what he did, nor how he behaved.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.760]   The thing that you can't explain at all is his resurrection, his conquest of death and
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   the grave.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.560]   But here are the facts which have brought the Church into being.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:12.240]   And then the other great person, of course, is God the Holy Ghost.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.160]   And the Bible tells us about him.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.920]   You're told about him brooding over the face of the deep at the original creation.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:28.360]   You read about him coming on men in the Old Testament and giving them abilities.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.840]   But especially you come to our Lord's teaching concerning him.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.880]   He always refers to him as "he," not "it," not an influence.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.120]   But "he," when he has come, he keeps on saying.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:48.320]   And above all, I commend to you a study of our Lord's prophecies concerning the coming
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.680]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.960]   Just as he was about to leave the people, he said to them, "Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.160]   He believe in God, believe also in me."
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.200]   He goes on to say, "I'm not going to leave you comfortless.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.320]   I'm not going to leave you to yourselves.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.520]   I'm going, but I'm going to send you another teacher, another comforter, another person
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.400]   who's going to be with you and will guide you and lead you into all truth and bring
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.560]   back to your remembrance the things that I've been teaching you.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.440]   Don't be distressed," he says, "of my departure.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.480]   I'm going to send him, and when he comes, that is what he'll do for you."
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.200]   Now, there you see is the essential teaching of the Bible.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:37.360]   God in three persons, blessed Trinity, operating on this world, dealing with it, acting upon
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:45.400]   it, molding its history, bringing to pass their own great and eternal purposes and plan
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   of salvation.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:53.380]   But obviously, I have to concentrate in particular tonight, in view of my text, upon the activity
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.400]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:04.120]   And of course, it is in the realm of the activity of the Holy Spirit we see most clearly this
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:12.920]   evidence of the supernatural realm and the activity of God in the affairs of men and
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.560]   the only hope of salvation.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:23.440]   His work, I say, is the greatest proof of the supernatural realm.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.440]   What is his work?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.080]   Well, his work can be divided into two main categories.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.560]   And we see the two things demonstrated to perfection in this story of what happened
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.480]   amongst the Samaritans.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.720]   There is first of all what we may call the general work of the Spirit.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.520]   What is his general work?
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:52.080]   Well, his first general work is his work of enlightening us.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:59.280]   You see, according to this teaching, because of sin, because of the fall, our minds are
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.280]   full.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.800]   We are all in darkness.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.160]   Why doesn't man believe that he's got a soul?
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.920]   It's because he's dark.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.960]   It's because he's blind.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.320]   He doesn't understand.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.160]   Why does man say that this is the only world?
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.860]   Because he can't see the other.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.880]   Why does man not believe in God?
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.280]   The Bible has given the answer in the Old Testament, because he's a fool.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:30.040]   He as the result of sin has become dulled in his understanding, in his mind, in his
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   reasoning, and in everything.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.680]   Now, there is ample evidence of this.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.200]   I'm not going over it tonight.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.420]   I dealt with it in a sense three or four weeks ago.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.280]   But this is how the apostle Paul sums it up.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:50.840]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   unto him.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.920]   Neither can he know, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:04.720]   You see, man in sin is exactly like the sort of man who is entirely lacking, to use a random
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:12.360]   illustration, in a sense of music, and a sense of appreciation of music.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.920]   You may play to him a symphony by Beethoven or by Brahms or by anybody you like, and he'll
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   tell you to turn off that beastly noise.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   Why?
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.720]   Well, because, you see, he has no appreciation.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.880]   Because he doesn't appreciate it, he says it's noise, it's painful, it's terrible, he
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.440]   doesn't want it.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.640]   He doesn't understand this.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.080]   He's a man of science, or he's something else, and he can't follow all this.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.000]   So it's meaningless, and it's gibberish, and he doesn't want it.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   That's man in a spiritual sense.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.960]   He lacks the faculty, and he says it's all nonsense, it's all foolishness.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.600]   Man's persuading himself about the very highest things of all.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.520]   Well, what does the Spirit do?
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.360]   Well, the Spirit enlightens us.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.160]   The apostle says, you remember, that when the Lord Jesus Christ was in this world, the
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.120]   princes of this world didn't know him.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.440]   For had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.000]   He says, you know, "I hath not seen nor heard, neither hath entered the heart of men, the
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.920]   things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.040]   Even with all his scientific observation, he says, "I can't see God.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.240]   I go up in a Sputnik.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.600]   I don't see God.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.880]   I don't see Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.920]   Therefore, they're not there, because I don't see them."
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.680]   Paul has answered them before they've ever thought of their argument, "I cannot see.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.360]   He dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable, and you can go higher and higher into space.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.480]   You'll never arrive at the realm in which God dwells.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   God is Spirit."
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.080]   "I hath not seen nor heard."
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:57.040]   You're dealing with a realm which is entirely beyond the reach of men at the very acme of
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   his achievements.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.280]   But the Spirit enlightens.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.480]   But God, says Paul, "hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.160]   For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.520]   Haven't you ever thought of this?
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.040]   Take a man who may have been a humanist or a deist or anything you like for most of his
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.680]   life, and suddenly he becomes a Christian.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.560]   Look at a man like the Apostle Paul himself.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.320]   There he was, opposed to Jesus Christ, telling us, "I verily thought with myself that I ought
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.080]   to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   He hated him.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   He reviled him.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.320]   He said, "This man's a blasphemer.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.720]   He says he's equal to God.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.960]   He claims to be the Son of God.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   This is monstrous.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   I must stop it."
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.560]   And he was absolutely sincere and genuine.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.600]   And yet you think of him, don't you, as the great Apostle Paul, preaching Jesus Christ
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   of the Gospel.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   What did it?
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.400]   Oh, it was the enlightenment that the Spirit alone can give.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   What else?
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   The Spirit not only gives us the ability to understand, he convicts us.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.600]   You know, I don't understand myself.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.320]   I don't understand the whole of life apart from this.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.680]   What is it that suddenly comes to men and disturbs them?
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.960]   They've been living a certain kind of life.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.680]   They were perfectly happy in it.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.020]   Suddenly they begin to feel uncomfortable.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.120]   Something gnaws at them.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.360]   Something nags at them.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.560]   The conscience begins to disturb within them.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   They're troubled.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   They don't know what to do.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   They try to shake it off.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   They can't shake it off.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.600]   What is this?
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.680]   This is the convicting power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.120]   He alone can do it.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.080]   My dear friend, don't misunderstand me.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.720]   I know that my reasoning and argument will never convince you of anything.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.440]   But thank God I stand in this pulpit and give you these arguments because I know that the
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.840]   Holy Spirit can convict you.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.880]   And you know it.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.560]   You wish he didn't, but he does.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.960]   And he won't leave you alone.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:57.440]   And let me tell you, if he started with you, he'll keep on with you.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.480]   Be careful how you resist the Spirit.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.960]   This is part of his ordinary life.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.000]   That's what he did to the Samaritans.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.760]   What made them believe this gospel?
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.160]   Here's a stranger, Philip.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   They knew nothing about him.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   He's just an ordinary man.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   Why did they listen to him?
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.760]   Oh, it was the Spirit that was in the men.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.600]   And he was convicting and he was converting.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.280]   And he does and he changes and he regenerates and he gives us a new nature and a new life.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.720]   This is his regular work.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.480]   He did it to the Samaritans.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.600]   And he goes on doing what we call a sanctifying work.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.640]   Sanctifying brought us to realize that we've got souls and that we are guilty before God
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.400]   and that we are lost.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.080]   He reveals the truth to us about the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, as one who
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:50.560]   has taken my sins upon himself and has borne my punishment and that in him I can be forgiven.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.520]   I believe that I find peace.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.920]   I know God.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.080]   And then he comes within me and he works in me, showing me sin and evil that I've never
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:06.120]   dreamt of and imagined, giving me power and understanding, a gradual work of sanctification
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.720]   and of deliverance from the power and the pollution of sin.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.760]   That is the regular work of the Spirit.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.200]   And you know, he'd been doing all that in these Samaritans before Peter and John ever
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.400]   came down amongst them.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.480]   It was because of that work of the Spirit that they had believed the gospel and had
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.680]   been baptized, both men and women, and they were attending upon the ministry and the preaching
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.640]   of Philip and they were growing from day to day and were rejoicing in their hearts in
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.440]   this great salvation.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:47.680]   But still, it is only the ordinary work of the Spirit, his general work.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.440]   But he also has a special work.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:35:00.560]   And it is perhaps in this special work that we see most distinctly not only the reality
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:08.200]   and the existence of the supernatural realm and of God in free persons, but the mighty
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.840]   acting of this triune God in the world and in the affairs of men.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:22.320]   What is this special work of the Spirit, this final answer to all humanism and deism and
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:28.520]   all that denies the supernatural and the influence of the supernatural in this world of time?
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.280]   Well, time, of course, is inadequate for me to tell you all about this.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.560]   I'm only going to pick out some two or three things which are of vital importance.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.080]   First, the Scriptures themselves.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.600]   I believe some people are observing this day as what they call Bible Sunday.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.240]   We don't do that because every Sunday is Bible Sunday.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.440]   What they mean, of course, is they want you to contribute to the distribution of the Scriptures
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.160]   through the various Bible societies.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   Bible Sunday.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yes, but what is the Bible?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   What are these Scriptures?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.480]   Now here is my question.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.920]   How do you explain them?
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.040]   How do you explain this book?
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.200]   Can this be explained in naturalistic terms?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:23.560]   Can this be explained solely in man and his innate abilities and power and reason and
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   understanding?
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:31.480]   Well, I suggest the first honest thing to do is to ask the writers themselves.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.080]   And they're honest enough to tell you that that is not the explanation.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:42.000]   They will all tell you that what they have written is what they have received, what has
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.160]   been given to them.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.800]   They say it in the Old Testament, they say it in the New Testament.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.360]   Some of them almost complain about it.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.240]   There's a prophet called Jeremiah, and poor Jeremiah, because of his deliverance of the
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.560]   message that God had given him, he was always getting into trouble.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.240]   And he came to the solemn decision, he said, "I'll speak no more in the name of God.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.360]   I don't want to be unpopular, I don't want to be maltreated, I don't want to be unhappy.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.520]   I'm not going to say any more."
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.480]   But he had to say more.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.160]   And what he had to say was not what he'd thought out, nor what he wanted to say, but what God
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.360]   had given him to say.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:26.800]   The explanation that these men give is simply this, that they have been given a revelation.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.700]   They were able men, some of them, but some of them were quite ordinary men.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.440]   Some of these apostles were most ordinary men.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.640]   Indeed, the authorities, as we've seen in Jerusalem, have already dismissed them as
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.520]   unlearned and ignorant men.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.960]   Fishermen, they say, "What do fishermen know about these things?
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   Who are they?"
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.760]   And this is the fact, you see, and this is the question you've got to answer.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.680]   How is it that a fisherman like Peter can expound scriptures as he did in the second
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.960]   chapter of Acts?
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.360]   How can he preach as he did?
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.640]   How can he get three thousand converts as he did?
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.120]   There's only one explanation.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.120]   It isn't Peter.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.400]   It's the power of the Spirit upon him.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.600]   And it's the same with all their writings.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.760]   It's a revelation.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.240]   They haven't concocted these ideas.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.440]   They say the burden of the Lord, or the message of the Lord, came unto me.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.000]   They will tell you how they were taken up by the Spirit.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.760]   A kind of divine afflatus came upon them.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.680]   They got into a state, if you like, of semi-ecstasy.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.720]   Suddenly they were receiving messages that they'd never thought of at all, and a compulsion
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.560]   to deliver them, and an assurance that they'd be guided in the deliverance, inspiration.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:47.040]   Now that is the only adequate explanation of the scriptures.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.520]   Revelation of the material, the knowledge, the inspiration, which enabled them to write
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.040]   it and to speak it and to deliver it and to record it.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.480]   Now this is what it says itself.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.200]   These are the very statements that are made by these authorities.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.480]   The apostle Paul, for instance, he was always saying this.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.160]   He was a brilliant man himself.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.760]   Yet never for a moment does he say, "This is my understanding."
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.560]   He says, "No, I was a fool.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.720]   I was a blasphemer.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.040]   I was a persecutor.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.480]   I was a denier.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:25.000]   But he mastered me, and he gave me this dispensation, this knowledge to deliver to you."
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.040]   So he writes to Timothy and says, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.600]   God breathed, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.680]   in righteousness, that the men of God may be perfect, truly furnished, and to all good
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   works."
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.200]   Peter obviously must say the same thing, and he does.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:53.800]   He writes his second epistle, and he says this, "Knowing this first, that no prophecy
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:00.440]   of scripture is of any private interpretation, for the prophecy came not in old time by the
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:09.920]   will of men, but holy men of God spake as they were moved, born along, carried along
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.240]   by the Holy Ghost."
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   Now, I say that you cannot explain these scriptures in general, apart from revelation and inspiration,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.480]   which is the work always of the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:33.960]   But let me give you one particular proof of this, and that is what we call prophecy.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:40.560]   To me, the argument of prophecy is sufficient in and of itself, without anything else, not
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:47.320]   only to prove the being of God, but the whole of the supernatural realm.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.240]   It's all beyond man.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   What am I talking about?
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.680]   Well, I'm thinking of the prophecies that you've got in the Old Testament, the writings
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.920]   of the great prophets, and other various forms of prophecy.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   What do I find there?
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.400]   Well, I find most astounding things.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:12.360]   I find predictions in detail of things which subsequently came to pass after a long period
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   of time.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.440]   I find it in the Old Testament.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.960]   I find that there are things prophesied in the Old Testament that when the prophet said
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   this and this is going to happen, and they did happen, even in the time of Old Testament
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.160]   history.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.000]   But still more important is this.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:40.160]   Here, these great prophets wrote about 800 years before the birth of Jesus Christ, and
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.480]   they tell you about his coming.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.560]   They tell you how he's going to come.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.320]   They tell you that he's going to be born in a place called Bethlehem.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.480]   Nobody else knew that.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.560]   The prophet said it 800 years before it happened.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:00.640]   And all sorts of details about his coming, about his life, about his death, all these
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.760]   things are there, stated plainly and clearly.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.640]   And you've got to explain that.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.080]   You've got to explain how men 800 years before the time could tell you these things
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.360]   in utter detail, and how they were verified in detail.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.540]   Peter again makes this point, and he says, "You know," he's writing to these Christian
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.160]   people who are being disturbed by the humanists of their age, and who are trying to say that
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.960]   Jesus Christ was only a man and not God.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   You know, says Peter, "We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.760]   unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   his majesty.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:47.200]   For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.400]   him from the excellent glory, saying, 'This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.'"
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:43:00.380]   Now look here, says Peter, "John and James and I were with him on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.980]   We saw him change.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.160]   We were with him.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.640]   We were with him going up.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.240]   We saw what happened to him there.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.320]   He was transfigured, transformed.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.280]   He was shining with a glory such as we've never seen.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.920]   We saw it, and we heard the voice from him."
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:21.320]   But listen, says Peter, "We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.560]   well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.120]   and the day star arise in your hearts."
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   He says, "If you don't believe my testimony, go back to the prophets.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.760]   Take their word of prophecy.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.760]   Look what they've said.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.600]   Look what they predicted in detail.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.080]   See how it's happened in Jesus Christ.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.080]   There's your evidence."
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.680]   There, he says, is your assurance.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   All the prophecies in detail concerning the coming of the Son of God.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.880]   And in addition, as Peter was so careful to point out, of course, in his sermon on the
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.280]   day of Pentecost, the prophecy of joy.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.080]   This tremendous thing happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.360]   Some people said, "What is this?"
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   Some said, "These men are drunk.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   They're obviously drunk.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   Look at them.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.360]   Their faces are shining.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   They're filled with joy.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.360]   They're in ecstasy.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   They're drunk."
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   "They can't be drunk," says Peter.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   "They haven't had time to get drunk.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   It's only the third hour of the day."
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   "No, no," he says, "this isn't drunkenness.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.360]   Do you know what this is?
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   This is that which was predicted and prophesied by the prophet Joel.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:30.800]   He said centuries ago that after the coming of the Son of God, the Deliverer, the Messiah,
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.320]   God was going to pour forth his blessing upon all flesh.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   He's doing it.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   He's done it.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   This is it."
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:43.120]   And here, you see, is another tremendous fulfillment and verification of prophecy.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.280]   How do you explain that?
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.960]   How does man, so many centuries before the time, prophesy these detailed, these historical
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.600]   events in this extraordinary way and manner?
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:01.320]   And then you get the prophecy of our Lord himself.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.080]   I've already reminded you how he told the people before he left them that he was going
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.200]   to send the Spirit upon them.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.080]   In the first chapter of this book of Acts, you'll see him with his followers, and he
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.960]   says to them, "Stay where you are in Jerusalem.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Stay where you are.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.480]   Don't start preaching.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.100]   Stay where you are until I send the Holy Spirit upon you.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.760]   You shall receive power.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.880]   I'm going to send him upon you."
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.360]   Ten days later, he came upon them.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.040]   Our Lord had predicted it.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   It came to pass.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.360]   It's not the only thing he predicted.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:46.720]   Jesus Christ predicted, prophesied the destruction of the city of Jerusalem.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.760]   They didn't believe him, but it came to pass.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.040]   He was crucified, let us say, A.D. 33.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.960]   Jerusalem, as he said in detail, was destroyed in A.D. 70.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.000]   He said another thing.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.600]   And if you want a little bit of contemporary history, listen to this.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:14.440]   He said that Jerusalem should be throttled down of the Gentiles for a long period of
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   time, but that it would come to an end.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.040]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:27.480]   I'm not saying that the Arabs may not reconquer Jerusalem, but I'm asking you to face this
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   fact.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.240]   It's rather strange, isn't it, what's happened this very year.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:39.360]   Jerusalem shall be throttled down of the Gentiles until...
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.880]   Isn't it time we began to think, my friends?
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.760]   How easy it is to say there's nothing beyond men.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.360]   How can anybody predict and prophesy things like this?
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:56.840]   Not only that, as I was pointing out to you a few Sunday nights ago, there is nothing
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:02.120]   that explains the state of the world as it is tonight apart from this.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.200]   Don't forget that it was Jesus Christ who said that there would be wars and rumors of
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:13.120]   wars, that in spite of the arrogance and the pride of the civilizations of men, that men
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.440]   would continue in sin, that there would be these calamities and wars, and we are getting
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.080]   them.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.640]   It's a fulfillment of his own word.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   Now these are facts.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.960]   There's the great fact of Scripture, a final answer to all humanism.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   But there are other facts.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.560]   Look what happened at our Lord's own baptism.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.040]   Here he is at the age of thirty, extraordinary man, and yet he spent his time working as
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   a carpenter.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.920]   At the age of thirty he goes to John the Baptist and asks him to baptize him.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.040]   And John is unhappy, but he does it, and as he was coming out of the water, the Holy Spirit
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.880]   descended upon him in the form of a dove, and he filled him with power.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:05.200]   And you know, though he was the Son of God, he had laid aside all his divine powers, and
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:11.120]   he had taken on him human nature, and he was determined to live in this world as a man.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.960]   And even he could have done nothing if he had not received that baptism of the Spirit.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.880]   For he says after it, as he stands up to preach in the synagogue in Nazareth, "The Spirit
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.680]   of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, recovering
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.560]   of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   year of the Lord."
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.880]   He closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down, and he began to
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.240]   say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.440]   The Spirit came upon him and gave him the power and the ability to preach, to work his
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   miracles.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:03.120]   He had done none of this for thirty years, for three crowded years, read of his activity,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:10.040]   and it is all the result of this endowment of the power of the Spirit.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.560]   And then come on again to the day of Pentecost.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.120]   Pentecost, my friend, is a fact.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.640]   I say again, we would not be here tonight but for the day of Pentecost.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:27.280]   These apostles were utterly cast down by the crucifixion and the death of our Lord.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.720]   Certainly he helped them after the resurrection by preaching to them, but still they have
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:35.160]   not got power, they cannot witness, they have not assurance, they have not authority.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.160]   But on the day of Pentecost he sent the Spirit upon them, and they were able to speak with
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:44.960]   authority and power to do these various other things.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.240]   Pentecost.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.600]   In the fourth chapter of this book, you remember we read of how the place where they were assembled
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.680]   together was shaken in answer to their prayer.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.600]   These are facts, and look at this thing which happened to these Samaritans.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.560]   We are dealing with history here.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.760]   Here they are, they have believed the preaching of Philip, they have been baptized, they are
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.040]   Christians, the Spirit of God is in them.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:14.120]   But as I read here, "He had not yet fallen upon them, only they were baptized in the
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.880]   name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:21.480]   But then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   This is a fact, a fact of history, a fact of experience.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:32.560]   And this is something that the Spirit has been continuing to do throughout the running
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   centuries.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.880]   We have been recently celebrating the 450th anniversary of the real commencement of the
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   Protestant Reformation.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.520]   How do you explain that?
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.940]   Why did it happen then?
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.440]   Why did it happen through this man Martin Luther?
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.080]   There were many other monks, many abler monks.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   Why this man?
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080]   How was he enabled?
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.400]   Where the power, where the courage, where the insight, where the understanding?
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.720]   Ask him himself and he'll always tell you.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.360]   It wasn't he, it was God.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.840]   God the Holy Spirit acting in him and through him.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:12.520]   And this is the story also of all the great revivals of history.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:19.920]   You know, my friends, that the Church is in a bad case and condition at the present time.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:25.120]   But this isn't the first time that the Church has been weak and ineffective and cast down.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.680]   It's been like this many a time before.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.560]   How has the Church kept going?
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.200]   Is it because of men like myself?
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   Not at all.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.760]   We would have ruined it centuries ago.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.080]   There's only one explanation.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.040]   God sending revival.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.760]   When men have been despairing, when they were at the end of their tether, when they were
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:48.120]   on the verge of giving up, suddenly there is a sound of a mighty rushing wind.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:53.880]   He comes upon them, the descent of the Spirit, as he came upon these men in Samaria who were
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.920]   already Christians.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.520]   He comes upon the Church.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.880]   It's our only hope tonight.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.840]   If we are to rely upon men and their organized campaigns, good though they may be, we are
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   finished.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:13.520]   But when God sends the Spirit, finished, it'll be the world that'll be in under conviction
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.480]   and crying out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   Revivals!
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.480]   The coming of the Spirit of God!"
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.640]   Well, can you explain the origin of a revival?
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.960]   Can your humanism, your psychology, explain the origin of a revival?
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.080]   They try to, of course.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.440]   You're familiar with the book, The Battle for the Mind?
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.920]   I've answered it on this very point, and I've never received a reply to what I said.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:45.180]   You can't explain the day of Pentecost in terms of psychology.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.720]   You can't explain any revival in terms of human activity.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.800]   I can prove that to you.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.160]   You know, I've known many men who, not understanding the doctrine of Scripture, have tried to organize
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.880]   a revival.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.160]   I've seen them doing it.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.840]   They said a revival came in the past in this way.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.200]   People prayed all night, and they made open confession of sins.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.960]   And a man called Phinney said, "Every time you do that, you can get a revival whenever
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   you like."
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.600]   Well, I've known large numbers of men who've tried it with great thoroughness.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   They've never got a revival.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   Never.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   It can't be done.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:23.840]   A revival always comes unexpectedly, suddenly, in spite of men.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.000]   And there's only one explanation.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.640]   It is the activity of God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:36.600]   Now, all these, you see, are evidences of the supernatural realm, of the being of the
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:43.840]   triune God, and the result of this great activity is always what it was on the day of Pentecost,
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.760]   what it was amongst these Samaritans.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:53.600]   Activity of understanding, assurance of salvation and joy in the Lord, exceptional power of
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:54:00.440]   speech, understanding, gifts of miracles and healings, tongues maybe, any one of these
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.760]   gifts, all the things that were prophesied by John.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:11.080]   "Your sons and your daughters shall dream dreams on your servants and on your handmaidens."
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:15.680]   Not on your great philosophers only, but on your servants and your handmaidens.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.400]   This power will come.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:25.060]   And the history of the Church is but a verification of this prophecy of joy repeated by the apostles
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.240]   right through this book of Acts.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.320]   Now then, my friend, I leave you with my question.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:39.440]   Are you aware of all this?
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:46.080]   Are you aware that there is another realm, a supernatural realm?
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:51.720]   Are you aware that God is, and in three persons?
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:55:01.000]   Or do you adopt this view which says that you and you alone matter and count, that everything
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.120]   is in your hands, that it's for you to make a perfect world, it is for you to put an end
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:15.360]   to war, it is you to reconcile separated husbands and wives, it is you to put an end to theft
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.720]   and robbery and chicanery and dishonesty, it's you to do it with your teaching and
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.640]   your education and your appeals, it's all left to you?
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:30.880]   Thank God it isn't true.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.080]   The world would be utterly and completely hopeless.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.560]   You know, even men who are not Christians are beginning to say strange things today.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:47.520]   I read an interview with an industrial authority in the paper a few weeks back, and he said
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:51.920]   the need today is for changed people.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.320]   Of course it is.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:59.280]   You see, man in sin doesn't respond to your appeals.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.600]   He doesn't want to.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.760]   You can say, "But this is unreasonable."
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.680]   He says, "You can say it's unreasonable, but I'm fighting for my life.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:12.120]   That's why there's going to be trouble on the railways tomorrow."
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.600]   The Minister of Labour says, "It's daft!"
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.080]   And yet they're doing it.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.080]   What's the matter?
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.560]   Now, I'm only taking one case.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.320]   They're all daft.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.040]   What's the use of education and culture?
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   This is the 20th century.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.840]   This is the century of knowledge, the century of man, the century of humanism.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.840]   But that's your problem.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:31.840]   Human nature.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.320]   Can you change it?
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   Of course you can't.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.320]   It's impossible.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:45.640]   The need is that people be changed and that people be given power.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.840]   And there's only one way in which that can ever happen, and that is the descent of the
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.520]   Holy Ghost.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.360]   He can change.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.600]   He can give a new birth, a new heart, a new nature, a new life, a new understanding.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   He's done so.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.680]   The glorious, the greatest periods in the history of this country have always been the
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.320]   periods that have followed reformation and revival.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:14.240]   Even in science, in art, in literature, in politics, every respect, they've all followed
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:24.640]   revival, the power of the Spirit changing men who then proceed to deal with their environment.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.880]   What happened to these people in Samaria can happen to you.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:34.640]   And if it doesn't happen to you, you're left to yourself.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.520]   And you've got to die and you've got to face God in the judgment, and you can't
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.520]   do it.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.720]   You can't deal with yourself, you can't deal with your world, you can't die, you
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.760]   can't stand before God in the judgment.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.200]   What shall you do?
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   Quite right.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.480]   Until you ask that question, you're damned.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.280]   But the moment you ask the question of those men listening to Peter, "Men and brethren,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   what shall we do?"
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:03.440]   The answer comes back, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:12.000]   for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for the promises to you and
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.560]   to your children and to as many as are far off."
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:24.800]   My friend, the supernatural is around you, and you can enter into it by faith in Christ.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.480]   And eventually we shall all enter into it.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:35.480]   But it'll either be to glory with God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, or else
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:40.360]   it will be to eternal spiritual darkness.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:46.200]   May God give us grace to listen to this message of this eighth chapter of the book of the
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:59:08.680]   Acts of the Apostles and cry out unto Him for salvation and for this fullness of the
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:38.480]   Word of God.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.080]   Amen.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:51.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
