[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   I'll stick my neck out for anarcho-capitalism and say that this is really the best system
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.200]   if we can figure out a way of doing it.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.200]   So there's no government like no government.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000]   People sometimes say, "Brian, are you an anarchist?"
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   And I'll say, "Well, not the crazy kind."
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.060]   But what I mean by this, I'm not someone who thinks that if you just pressed a button and
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.360]   got rid of the government that things would be good.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.240]   I think it would be a total disaster.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.200]   Rather, what I think is that there is another equilibrium that is totally doable if people
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.640]   realize that it's totally doable.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.720]   And this equilibrium is one where we actually have competing police, competing legal systems,
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.680]   competing court systems.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.600]   It's one where if I had an hour, I could not convince anyone that disagrees, but I believe
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.440]   if you gave me an hour, I could convince you that it's not crazy, which is what I actually
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.860]   do whenever I talk about this stuff.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.760]   I say, "Look, I have a really radical idea now.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   I couldn't possibly convince a reasonable person in an hour, so I'm not going to try.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.600]   What I'm going to try to do is convince you in an hour that this view, though you still
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.280]   will think it's wrong, is not crazy.
