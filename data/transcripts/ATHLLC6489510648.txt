[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.200]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.720]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to help you upgrade your
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.680]   life, money, travel, and more.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.520]   Now, I'm sure we all have that favorite article or video that we've all read
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.320]   and we've watched a dozen times and shared to countless people.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.080]   I can't remember how I came across mine first, but for me, it's a talk
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   from David Marquet about leadership.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.360]   And when I was running my last startup, I watched it every few months and sent
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.880]   it to so many friends and colleagues in leadership roles.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.040]   So if you sense a bit of excitement in my voice, it's because I'm
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.560]   joined by David himself today.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.320]   And for those of you who don't know him, David Marquet is a distinguished
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.840]   submarine captain who, as commander of the USS Santa Fe, took the ship and
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.800]   its crew from being one of the worst performing in the Navy to the most
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.560]   combat effective ship in the squadron.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.080]   He documented that journey in an incredible bestselling book, Turn
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.720]   the Ship Around, which was listed as one of the 12 best business books
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.360]   of all time, and he followed that up in 2020 with another bestselling
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.000]   book, Leadership is Language.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.560]   In our conversation, we'll dive into the unique perspective he has on
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.920]   leadership and break down the tactics you can apply to your own lives,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.640]   whether you're at the top or bottom of your organization.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   All right, we have a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.960]   David, thank you for being here.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.480]   How are you?
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.920]   Good, Chris.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.160]   Thanks for having me on your show.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.600]   Welcome all listeners.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.640]   So I would just love to start by hearing how your definition of
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.600]   leadership has evolved since you first started thinking about it.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.480]   My definition of leadership was handed to me, like in the Navy, if they want
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.960]   you to have something, they're going to give it to you.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.040]   If they haven't given it to you, you don't need it.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.840]   So my definition of leadership started like this.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.680]   Leadership can be defined as directing the thoughts, plans, and actions of
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.000]   others so as to command their obedience, confidence, and thorough respect.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.040]   Basically something like that.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.000]   But it was about this, it was in this model of the leader is the decision
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.920]   maker, the leader is the brains of the organization, and the team is the body.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.240]   The team executes what the leader wants.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.040]   And it's a model that got the human race a long way.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.640]   It was a model that was alive during the Industrial Revolution.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.280]   It was a model that a lot of people cling to because there's psychological
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.640]   seductions in the model when you're the leader and everyone thinks you're
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.400]   important and they got to stand and wait for your word and that kind of thing.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.560]   But it's not the best model for the highest performing teams
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.840]   on the planet today, in my opinion.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.400]   I had to learn the hard way that the model didn't work when the Navy signed
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.280]   me as a submarine commander to a submarine I'd never been on before.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.120]   I'd finished this 12-month course for the submarine I was supposed to go to,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.000]   but at the last minute, through some circumstances, I ended up going to
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.400]   Santa Fe, and I'd never been on this kind of submarine, and so now it was a
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.760]   life-and-death thing, like every time I gave an order, it was an X probability
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.800]   we were going to die because it could be right, it could be wrong.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.920]   The team was going to do it anyway.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.680]   And I had to unlearn all my leadership behavior.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.920]   So leadership to me now is much more like creating the environment where
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.680]   people can be at their best just the way they are, not changing people, not
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.400]   saying, well, you need to be more proactive and you need to have more
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.960]   assertiveness, but just you want to change someone, change yourself, work on that.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.600]   So it's about, it's always about other people and it's
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.960]   about creating the environment.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   So the question is like, under what conditions are humans at our best?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.160]   Under what conditions are you at your best?
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.360]   And that's what you want to do in your company, because then
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.760]   everyone will be at their best.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.600]   They'll be at their best human, which I think means using our brains a lot.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.160]   And it'll be awesome for everybody.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.320]   I want to talk about some of those tactics, but was there a moment on the
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   Santa Fe that you said, wow, this has to change?
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.840]   Well, yeah, there was, of course I knew that I hadn't been on the submarine
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.560]   and the crew knew that I was trained for a different, I mean, because the
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.960]   captain quit before me, they got airdropped in with basically no notice.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.080]   But I was standing in the control room.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.240]   We were starting a drill.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.760]   This was our first day at sea and the submarine had a bad reputation.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.040]   So my mindset was, oh, we're going to train hard.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.440]   We're going to run all these hard drills on ourselves and we're
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.680]   going to beat performance into the ship.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.000]   And then maybe people will be happier because there was two
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   problems, horrible morale, horrible performance.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.800]   So we start the first exercises.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.160]   We shut down the reactor, it's called reactor scram and reactor scram.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.600]   And then you don't have power.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.960]   You're depleting your battery.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.120]   Guys are running around and I want to make it harder.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.720]   So I say, hey, let's speed up on the backup electric motor.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   And the officer orders it.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.000]   Well, it turns out there was only one, it was only one speed
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.160]   motor on the Santa Fe, the Navy was always moves towards simpler equipment.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.320]   So instead of a two speed motor, like having two gear, two
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.600]   gears on your car is just one.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's like a fixie for a bicyclist.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.920]   And I didn't know that.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.840]   But the scary thing is the officer who I suggested it to ordered it.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:54.320]   And then the sailor just looked stupefied and he said, there's no second gear.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:02.560]   And this is like not knowing what the color of your car is or something like
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.280]   one of the most basic things like you need to know as a submarine commander.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.640]   And I had made this horrendous mistake.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.240]   I was embarrassed and I was sad.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.640]   And I had this light bulb moment.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.280]   Number one, I didn't order it.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.680]   He did.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.880]   Number two, all my leadership training was irrelevant because all my leadership
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.280]   training was about making decisions and getting people to do it, but
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.920]   it's all predicated in being right.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.480]   And then, oh, in the unlikely event that I'm not correct, I'm going to
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.360]   harangue the team and say, oh, it's your obligation to speak up and tell me I'm
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.280]   wrong. Problem is, as long as you make it harder for people to do something,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.160]   they're going to do it less.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.280]   So step one, the first tactic is shut up.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.320]   Stop telling people what to do.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.040]   There's so many negative things that happen from telling people what to do.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.880]   You give them permission to shut your brains off.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.960]   You absolve them of responsibility for their behaviors, on and on and on.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.440]   So you just don't tell them what to do.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.280]   Say, well, you tell me, if you were me, what would you do?
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.520]   If you were the captain, what would you do?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.680]   And so we just embed this language.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.080]   And it was, for us, the magic word was intent.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.560]   I said, just stop saying, I would like permission to.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.760]   Stop saying, I hope to.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.960]   Stop saying, would you approve it for me to do this?
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.520]   Just say, this is what I intend to do.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.280]   And now the bias is the answer is yes, unless you hear no, as opposed to the
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.880]   answer is no, unless you hear yes.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.600]   And this has a huge impact.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.240]   The second thing is, it puts you in the role of evaluating decisions rather than
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.480]   making decisions, which is much more powerful.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.320]   I tried this at my company.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.200]   I just said, you know, someone's saying, Oh, what should we do here?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.000]   I said, what do you, what do you think we should do here?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.040]   And I think it went well.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.960]   It's easier, I guess, when you don't have an answer.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.400]   When you don't know the answer, you genuinely have to ask.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.280]   A lot of times people do have an answer or do have an opinion.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.320]   And it's a little harder and it takes some reinforcement.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.480]   But when you told the team, Hey, I'm not going to make any decisions.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.240]   It's on you.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.440]   Did everyone get it?
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.880]   No, I got the officers together and I was shaken because this was visceral.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.960]   This was life and death.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.320]   We know teams where the leader will make a decision.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.400]   It'll be a terrible decision, but everyone does it.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.680]   Winter corn CEO, Volkswagen.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.080]   We're going to do this thing with the diesel engines.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.120]   It's a, we, you can't.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.960]   So the team goes through all these things, cheat of a horrible reputation,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.840]   but they're absolved of the responsibility because they were told to.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.640]   Now he'll say, I didn't actually tell him that.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.080]   Yeah, but you've set up, set it up.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.480]   So that was the only way we think anyway, you know, you know, the story we got
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.040]   together, I was looking at my shoes.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.360]   They were looking at their shoes.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.520]   I said, we've got a problem.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.960]   And I hit on this idea where I'm going to be this commanding officer of the
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.840]   submarine and never give any commands.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.600]   I said, because as soon as I start telling you guys what I think there's going to,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.800]   it's just, it's not going to be binary, but it's just going to be harder for you
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.720]   to speak up and tell me what you think.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.400]   So how about this?
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.360]   You tell me what you think first, and then I'll tell you yes or no.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:59.800]   And the majority of people wanted it right away, even I, but I know no one
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.240]   really understood the implications.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.440]   You, I can't say, watch this movie and you'll get a sense of what it was like.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.120]   Every movie.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.800]   I just finished watching this thing that BBC, I don't know if it's it, but it's
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.400]   a UK thing gone vigil is whore.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.080]   It's hideous.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.640]   It's horrible.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.840]   Like the way they portray the Navy is just the worst, the most horrible,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.280]   like nonsensical, this would never happen.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.120]   But one thing that they portray, which is correct is the captain's going
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.080]   around giving all these orders.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.600]   Like he's always telling people he never wants to see someone come to the
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.320]   cab and say, captain, this is what I intended to do.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.000]   The cat, we really need to do this.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.120]   And why?
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.040]   Cause it's a drama.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.080]   The camera has to go someplace, but that's not the right way to run a company
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.400]   because it's, you just get thinking of one versus the thinking of everyone.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.000]   But one of the things we say is don't convince me, commit behaviors, not action.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.920]   So I was talking to two owners, two, two company founders for the show.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.880]   And they said, Hey, we've got a situation where one of the guys on the team, like
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.000]   it's coming up with the wrong answer for how to manage a technology product.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.040]   And they're reluctant to just tell them what to do, which I can't sense that, but
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.760]   it's okay to sometimes, sometimes do that.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.640]   They say, well, how much do we explain?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.800]   And so they said, I want to tell them this when I tell them to do it this way.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   And like everything that the person cited, if we're going to use this other
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.640]   plat, this platform, which is bigger.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:30.960]   Okay.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   If you get the person to test and you said, is this platform bigger?
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.280]   And every question would be right.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.960]   So none of those reasons are the reasons why the person's not doing it.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.320]   There's some other reason, but in the end, don't, you don't need
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.120]   to convince them they're wrong.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.640]   That's really derogatory.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.120]   So, you know what, you might be right, but we're going to do it this way.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.080]   Now you leave as much open decision space as possible.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.440]   So I'm not adverse to leaders quote, making decisions, but there's two things.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.200]   Number one, you focus that your decision should be on building ownership and
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.800]   creating the structure, not tweaking the decisions.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.720]   If you think about it like a car, let's say we're making cars.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.760]   We start a car company.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   The old way was we put an inspector at the end of the assembly line.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:22.640]   We say, Hey, car defect, refit, car, good, sell car, car, sell, sell, sell defect.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.360]   And that's how we view ourselves as leaders making decisions.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.440]   Oh, I'm going to be the guy who's the quality inspector for decisions as
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.720]   opposed to baking in an assembly line.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.440]   So the processes in my company just inherently result in better, more
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.000]   resilient, adaptive decisions.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.320]   And I can get out of the business of being that quality inspector.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.160]   But the cost is I don't get the psychological juice of everyone.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.880]   I'm bend at knee trying to understand, Oh, what's what's Jack
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.480]   Welch telling us to do today?
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.640]   If people are empowered to make the decisions, but management overrides them,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.400]   does it make it harder or how do you resolve situations where you're giving
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.840]   the team the kind of length of rope to run with it, but they're coming up with
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.160]   the wrong answer, obviously you can coach them, but, but how do you handle that?
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.600]   Almost all the decisions that we make are reversible or tweakable.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:29.200]   So we have in our heads, we have this unspoken structure that we make decisions
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.800]   for all time and they're either work or don't work and it's very binary.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.440]   And it's not, it's not like that.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.840]   In my opinion, every decision is really a hypothesis.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.880]   If we do this, then that.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.680]   And then, so what you do is say, okay, so this decision is, we are going to try
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.520]   this, whatever for a month or try it this way for a month, see what we learn.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.280]   Then we'll tweak it.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.320]   Which may possibly mean scrapping it, but generally it means like
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.480]   tweaking it and improving it.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.080]   But it puts people, number one, it's not so heavy.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.760]   We're not saying, Oh, we're having initiative from now on.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   We're going to use Slack and nothing.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.840]   Everyone goes, Oh my gosh.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.800]   So we say, Hey, we're going to, let's try this.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.080]   We're going to run Slack for a month.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   Let's see what we learn.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.080]   And then it puts people in a learning mindset, which allow, and then, then
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.440]   they also have a sense that they can control their outcome because I'm going
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.880]   to be interested in what you've learned so that we can tweak how we use Slack.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.760]   Whatever happens to be.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.320]   I mean, sometimes it, as a leader, it's, it's worth letting someone do something
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.520]   that you think might be wrong just to go through the process of learning.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.680]   I mean, I think that's depends on how I wouldn't let the engineer comes up and
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.960]   says, Hey, I have a new idea for starting the reactor.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.600]   You're like, yeah, no things that involve the laws of physics.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.000]   I would not do a lot of experimentation on if they involve humans.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.400]   Then yeah, I, I like to think how we manage vacation or who's on the project
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.760]   team or how we select a project teams or how often do they meet or what's the.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.160]   Things like that.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.120]   There's no laws of physics are going to be violated if we say, okay, everyone's
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.480]   just working at home or everyone working in the office or has people working in
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.200]   the office, fine, let's just try it.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.880]   See what happens.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.120]   It's not like deciding.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:25.320]   For example, the software on an airplane where people die, if it's wrong, for
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.560]   example, and you talk a bit in, in your first book about needing competence and
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.360]   clarity within the org.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.960]   So a couple of things that, that I took away are, are making sure everyone's
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.480]   hearing the same message, repeating the message, specifying goals, not methods.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.000]   Are there other kind of big takeaways there of things that kind of can
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.400]   reinforce a new model of control?
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.040]   So one of the things I learned was, is you're giving people the
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.320]   authority to make decisions.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.080]   They're not always going to make the right decision and there's limits to it.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.600]   There's a right and a wrong way to do it.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   For me, the two input variables, since you're a fellow mathlete, you'll get
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.640]   this, the two input variables for me were technical competence and organizational
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:06.960]   clarity.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.280]   So in other words, the function of how much control I'm going to give you is a
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.600]   function of how much technical competence you have, how much understanding of what
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.680]   we're trying to do you have.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.120]   And then plus this tiny, I call it the Z factor, which is like a growth factor plus
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.440]   Z.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   So in other words, if I can perfectly tune your decision-making authority to
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.160]   your skills, that's not what you want.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.880]   You actually want to do a little bit more because that's where the growth
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.720]   happens and you want people to be excited.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.080]   Oh, look, I'm learning new things.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.680]   Oh, look, I'm making bigger decisions.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.040]   You want that sense of progress.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.120]   Otherwise it becomes static and no one wants to play there.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.440]   Which seems a little counter to a common idea of give this person control once
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.480]   they, once they've earned it and demonstrated that they can handle it, is
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.200]   that turning it on the table and say, no, give them more control and see if they
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.800]   can handle it.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.240]   So when my daughter was growing up, for example, she wanted a later bedtime.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.600]   So her bedtime is at nine and she wants to stay up to midnight.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.640]   So I said, okay, once you demonstrate the ability to stay up to midnight, I'll then
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.120]   extend your bedtime to midnight.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.320]   And that is the stupid, this is a, well, how can I demonstrate the ability if I
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.640]   don't, but you don't also say, fine, stay up to midnight for all ever.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.960]   What, what you say to me as a parent is great.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.520]   Let's run an experiment for the next two weeks.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.640]   You can stay up to midnight.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.160]   We'll see how you do.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.800]   And then in two weeks, we're going to have a meeting and we're talking about it.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.240]   And you're going to tell me what you learn.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.080]   I'll tell you what I learned.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.480]   And we're going to tweak the experiment, which including maybe going back to nine
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.560]   o'clock, but you don't pump up a balloon inside a box.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.960]   And then when the balloons pumped up, make a bigger box.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.560]   That's not, you make a bigger box and then the balloon can grow into that bigger
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:49.920]   box.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.520]   And then you, that's, that's what you do.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.800]   You got to make the box bigger so that the person can grow into it.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.720]   And if, if you let people make decisions in an org and you're no longer the one
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.200]   making decisions, does it abdicate the leader of ever being wrong or, or what
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.840]   happens there?
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.800]   No, because you're still responsible.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.440]   You still have a chance to veto it.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.680]   So for example, someone says, cause something happened in my company recently
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.200]   where someone said, Hey, I want to try this.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.960]   Oh, this is going to, I was on travel in a faraway place and an overwater
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.880]   bungalow and a significant client wanted an event.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.120]   And we contacted the place and said, what kind of bandwidth you have?
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.160]   Oh great.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.880]   You can do all kinds of, you can do an online zoom event from wherever.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:39.560]   Bottom line was it didn't work because they didn't have the bandwidth and the
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.120]   internet was not stable enough.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.040]   Now I technically didn't make this decision.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.720]   My team said, Hey, we think you can do it.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.560]   We think it'll work.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.520]   So we tend to go forward, but I had a chance to veto it.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.680]   So I'm still wrong.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.800]   It was, it was a harebrained idea in retrospect, but what I liked was the
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.840]   team had a bias for action, the bias for doing stuff as opposed to like, Oh no,
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.640]   we can't like this.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.200]   There's just too much of that in my mind.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.760]   So I think every once in a while you got to push it.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.920]   So I didn't feel bad, but Hey, it's, it's still your fault.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.760]   I do think you should know your job, but it's like you said, it's when you know
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.120]   the decision or you quote, think, you know, that it's so hard not to tell
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.520]   people what to do because there's a sense of urgency.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.320]   So I always try and say, just tell me more, buy myself some time.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.200]   Oh, tell me more, especially when what you hear sounds wrong or odd to you.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.120]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.920]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.040]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.000]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.240]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.640]   37,000.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.160]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.520]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.080]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.400]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.800]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.600]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.320]   days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.920]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.520]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.360]   system with one source of truth.

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.560]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.480]   the companies I've run, makes everything so much better.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.720]   So right now, download NetSuite's popular KPI checklist, designed to give you
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:51.240]   consistently excellent performance, absolutely free at allthehacks.com/netsuite.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.040]   That's allthehacks.com/netsuite to get your own KPI checklist.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.480]   Allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.640]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.360]   is actually so good for you.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.120]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.880]   It has so many health benefits.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.840]   And I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume it is
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.000]   from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.480]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:28.520]   leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.400]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.640]   minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.800]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.160]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.400]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.120]   Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.880]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.280]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.200]   backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar,
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.240]   and more, and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.080]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.040]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.440]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money backed guarantee.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.640]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:34.320]   12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.880]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.240]   The next question I wanted to ask was about that sense of urgency.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.120]   And it's something I always struggled with was, you put all the responsibility
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.280]   on other people and you have these important deadlines, how do you create a
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.600]   sense of urgency within that organization when it's not already there?
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.200]   Obviously a team of more than one person can come up with more actions and more
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.760]   things and more ideas than you as one single person can keep up with.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.720]   So when you've got a team of a hundred, 150 people, a hundred thousand
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.280]   people, you can't keep up.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.880]   You don't want that.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.440]   You want them pushing on you so hard that you can't keep up.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.800]   And it happens by you leaning back.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:23.080]   Not by leaning in and controlling, like Chris, run more, lose more weight.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:23.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.360]   That, Oh shit.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.320]   Thanks.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.040]   Now I got it.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.240]   Does that ever work for anybody?
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.120]   I don't think so.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.880]   It's not about that.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.120]   Like, it's gotta come from within.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.600]   You gotta be intrinsically motivated.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.040]   Your team's gotta be intrinsic.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.680]   You tap the intrinsic motivation.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.560]   And then you get all these people that are intrinsically pushing
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.480]   you so hard, you can't even keep up.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.160]   When you're feeling that sense of discomfort, like imagine like you're
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.400]   sitting in a go-kart and you got like all these people pushing you.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.880]   It's like, ah, you guys are going too fast.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.480]   That's the feeling you want.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.800]   And so obviously the way to create that feeling is not to
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.840]   tell everyone to drive faster.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.320]   Uh, tactics I've tried in the past are things like making sure everyone
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.440]   understands why we're doing what we're doing, talking about the vision,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.760]   talking about what purpose we have, what the goals are, what's
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.840]   going on in the environment.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.440]   Are there other things that can build and create that intrinsic motivation?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.920]   Sense of agency, a sense of purpose.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   Like you're talking about a hundred percent sense of agency.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.360]   And a sense of connectedness.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.960]   So agency is, okay, I get to make decisions.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.760]   I have authority over my life.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.400]   I can control, and my decisions are linked to outcomes.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.040]   I make these decisions.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   I'm going to have this kind of, I made those other decisions,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.840]   make that kind of a life.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.120]   And a sense of connection with other human beings.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.640]   That was one that was hard for me because I tended to be
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.200]   a person who didn't need, I didn't feel like I needed a lot
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.880]   of connection as a human.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.800]   And like have this book, Blue Zones of Happiness on the shelf behind me.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.200]   So I'm reading about these people who live longer and has big network
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.120]   of community and like, you know, I don't feel that way.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.440]   I'm just perfectly happy doing my own, my own thing.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.960]   But studies show that it's true.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.080]   And there's a sense of connection.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.800]   Now, maybe the way I connect is different than the way someone else
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.680]   connects, but you want the team to connect.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.400]   One way we did that was we outlawed the word "they."
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.000]   On a submarine, you have a pretty tight team because
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.680]   everyone dies or we all live, but there's no, it's not like a company
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.880]   where three people can exit and then the rest of the company goes under.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.960]   It's not like that.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.840]   But we had a lot of they's.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.640]   We had rank, we had enlisted guys, we had officers, we had crew,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.240]   we had the engineering officer.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.440]   We had they, they, they, they.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440]   Who made this mistake?
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.280]   It was always they.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.760]   So I got pissed off one day.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.280]   I said, "There's no they on Santa Fe!"
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:45.880]   And it rhymed.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.600]   So they loved it.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.440]   They remembered it and they believed it.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:54.080]   So he said, "We ordered the wrong parts," or "We didn't set
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   the equipment up correctly," or "We misread the signals,"
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.480]   whatever it happened to be.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.840]   And then our brains rewired and it felt like a team.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.760]   The action came first.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.120]   We activated new thinking.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   So we use the word "we."
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.520]   When I go into companies, I just listen.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.000]   I say, "Hey, tell me about these guys."
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.680]   "Oh, yeah, we're the marketing team."
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.720]   "What about these guys?"
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.320]   "Oh, they're engineering."
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   "Ah, that's the team boundary."
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.000]   "Not what the org chart says."
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.160]   Or, "Who made this decision?"
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.080]   "They did, not we."
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.480]   Very clear.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.520]   So I get, I have fun when I check into hotels sometimes and I'm talking
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.800]   to the person at the front desk and there's something wrong or whatever.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.440]   And they'll say, "They, blah, blah, blah."
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.240]   I was like, "Who's they?"
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.840]   Like, "You have a Marriott jersey on."
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.680]   Not me.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.880]   Is that a simple tactic that companies can experiment with?
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.960]   And I hear the, "I intend to."
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   Obviously there's some big things, step away, resist the
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.120]   urge to jump in as a leader.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.680]   But little kind of like, I'll call them hacks because this is the show.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.200]   It's tell people to tell you what they intend to do.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.040]   To start using "we" instead of "they."
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.240]   Are there others like that, that are things that you can quickly implement
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.480]   and see if they have big effects?
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.840]   For sure.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.160]   Stop asking binary questions.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:19.960]   So when someone comes to you and says, "I want to try this," or, "Here's a new idea,"
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.920]   your instinct's going to be, "Is it safe?
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.160]   Will it work?
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.320]   Are you sure?"
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.880]   Those are all binary questions.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.560]   COVID vaccine.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.280]   Is it safe?
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.680]   Stupid question.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.640]   Meaningless question.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.560]   Doesn't, if you say yes or no, it really means you think
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.600]   you're going to get it or not.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.240]   It doesn't really tell us much about the safety of it.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.200]   How safe is it?
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.520]   So my trick is start the question with the word, "How?"
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.440]   How safe is, how sure are you?
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.960]   How likely is this assumption to come true?
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:58.040]   Now someone can say, "Ah, I'm 99% confident," or, "I'm 51%, but we should try it anyway."
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.200]   Now you're learning something.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.720]   And it all starts with the word, "How?"
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:10.000]   The second thing is, next, in meetings, pay attention to what we call share of voice.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.880]   Share of voice is, if you were to count the number of words that each person in the meeting said,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.680]   it would be that word, it would be that histogram of the distribution of words.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:27.280]   Traditionally, unless you've been thinking about this, the higher-paid people will say
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.080]   more words than the lower-paid people.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:34.680]   The more skewed that is, the more fragile your decision-making structure is.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.280]   The extreme case, the leader just tells people what to do.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.200]   Everyone shuts up and walks out the door.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.480]   So you can imagine how extreme and how fragile that is.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:50.200]   So you've got six people, you're in a decision meeting, the share of voice should be about
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.600]   a sixth per person, because then you're hearing what everyone sees, you know what
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.240]   everyone knows, and the group benefits.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.600]   And science shows that those are more resilient and adaptive teams.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.640]   So when you're, if you're leading the meeting, the point of leading the meeting is not to
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.160]   get your quote point across.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.880]   That's just coercion and with the hope of compliance.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.640]   The point of leading a meeting is to pay attention to the structure of the meeting so that you
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.760]   can even the share of voice, which means if someone's talking too much, you've got to
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   control them.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.280]   And if someone's not speaking, well, you have to make it safer than speak up.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:33.880]   And how do you do that?
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.440]   I think it's easier to know how to tell someone, hey, you've said a lot.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.440]   Chris, I think we know what you, yeah, well, first of all, it starts from the structure
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.960]   of the meeting. Most meetings are run, discuss, then vote.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.560]   Hey, we have to make a decision.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.880]   Are we going to put our new plant in Seattle or North Carolina?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.520]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:57.520]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.680]   OK, so what's everyone think?
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.640]   And then it's this binary vote, Seattle versus North Carolina.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:11.280]   So the problem with that is because the discussion is a series discussion, the initial,
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.400]   the very first people to speak have an overweighted importance in the discussion in terms
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:22.040]   of anchoring the group, which which makes the people who think differently than them less
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.360]   and less likely to contribute.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.360]   So what you want to do is vote first, then discuss.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.760]   So we would say, OK, let's take a vote on this.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.080]   We could use cards.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.200]   We could use our hands.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.960]   We say, OK, five, let's use our hands.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.280]   Five fingers means I'm one hundred percent or ninety nine percent.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.560]   We don't like to say one hundred percent because that assumes an arrogance for the future
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.200]   that you is unfounded.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.840]   But I'm ninety nine percent sure Seattle's the right place.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.040]   Zero means I'm ninety nine percent sure Raleigh's the right place or any number in between.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.320]   Two or three means you basically don't know or don't care.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.480]   Ready one, two, three, pop up your hands.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.960]   Now I'm looking for the fives and the zeros.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.280]   I'm looking for the extremes.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.440]   And then we say, OK, let's hear from.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.720]   And I got a whole bunch of fives, but not too many zeros.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.960]   So now I say, OK, great.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.040]   Let's hear from zeros.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.080]   Let's hear from the people who voted zero, not the zeros, but people voted zero.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.680]   Why? The fives are going to want to talk.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.800]   The fives, there's a majority of them.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.880]   But we already know, like if that's the majority opinion, we already know the majority
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.840]   opinion. We don't need to spend more time on it.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.160]   Let's end. And the more we talk about the majority opinion, harder it is for the minority
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.960]   opinion to say what they really think.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.760]   They may say, oh, yeah, you're right, but I was thinking something different.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.240]   But that's the kind of thing you want to do.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:46.080]   Vote first and discuss and then spotlight the dissenting and outlying opinions by letting
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.520]   those people speak.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.200]   It's always hard to get people to speak up.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.560]   Are there tactics if you notice the person who's a zero is like, well, you know, I just
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.400]   don't like is there encouraging things?
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.160]   Is it best done offline?
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.040]   Have you tried doing it asynchronously with written communication for those who don't
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.840]   love talking? Yeah, that's all good stuff.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.520]   One of the things. So it's always about safety.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.960]   People are speaking up because it's not it doesn't feel safe to speak up.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.880]   So choice and small makes it safe.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.560]   The other thing that makes it safe is the level of cognitive involvement, description,
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.800]   assessment, action.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.000]   It goes in that order.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.400]   So description is the safest thing.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   If I just said, tell me about the Riverside platform that we're using to make the show,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.120]   it's fine. You're just like, well, here it is that it costs this much, whatever.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.240]   Then I say, well, give me an assessment, like on a scale of one to nine.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.000]   How effective is it?
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.320]   OK, now. But now it requires more vulnerability.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.600]   But and then finally, if I say, give me take action.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.480]   Well, what platform should we use for our podcast show?
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.000]   Now I can be wrong. So we always invite people on this.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.960]   There's two sequences you want to follow.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:12.000]   Number one is description, assessment, action, because it it moves from safe to vulnerable.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.280]   The second one is we call it one sum all.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:22.280]   So imagine you have a group of people, five groups of you have twenty five people, five
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.800]   tables of five. If you just said to the group, hey, what does everyone think about this?
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.880]   Raise your hand. You might not get any hands.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:38.640]   So what you say is at your everyone right down on a card, three, three things about
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.600]   ABC. This let's say let's go back to the seat.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.120]   Where's the new plan going to be?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:49.840]   Write down which of the two places you want the plan to go in three reasons.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.920]   And one reason why you it might be a bad idea.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.320]   You have two minutes. And so that's the one.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   It's safe, right?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.760]   I just it's me and it's my car.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.120]   Like, why wouldn't I write anything down?
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.800]   So people write things down and they say, OK, now at your table, share what's on your
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.120]   card. Now, the key there is don't share what you could say that will share what you
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.640]   think. That would be what you might say.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.920]   But you say share what's on your card because now you sort of distance it from you.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.480]   I'm just reading what's on my card.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.680]   Yeah, of course it is like what you think, but just even these little things help a
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.600]   little bit. OK, let's just share what's on your card.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   And then as a table, you could give them another thing, OK, come up with the top five
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.880]   and bottom, whatever, something like that.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.800]   And you give them more time.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.160]   So if you give them two minutes by themselves, you might give them five minutes at a
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:46.040]   table. You say, OK, now who would like to share or does it which table has something
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.320]   that they'd like to share with the group?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.920]   Now you get a bunch of hands pop right off the bat.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.240]   So it's one sum, S-O-M-E, sum all is the progression.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.400]   And then it's description, assessment, action.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.440]   The other way to think about it is description is pause, like VCR buttons pause.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.320]   I'm just here's what it is.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.880]   Here's what I see. Assessment where that's rewind, where does it come from?
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.360]   That feels more that pause is the most certain thing.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.080]   I feel most certain about it because I'm just looking at it right here.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.040]   And then, well, how does that like what does this happen?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.880]   It's from the past, so it's knowable, but I might not have seen everything, but it
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.080]   feels relatively knowable.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.520]   Then finally, we go to the future.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.160]   So it's pause, rewind, future, pause, rewind, future.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.760]   And then when we trained our team, so the sailors would call me, the officers would
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.360]   call me in the middle of night, three in the morning.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.680]   We have a situation, the tankers bearing down on us, whatever it happens to be.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.520]   They always they always reported these things in this exact sequence, which was
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.680]   description, assessment, action.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.800]   Captain, we're on we're at this location.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.080]   We're on this course. We're heading north at five knots, 400 feet.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.640]   We have a sonar contact assessment.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.360]   I think it's a tanker coming straight at us.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   Action. I intend to turn right and go deeper, something like that.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.320]   Always in the exact same sequence.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.920]   And sometimes they wouldn't get the whole way.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.640]   They would say assessment, description, assessment.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.960]   I don't and then then action.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.120]   I have no idea what to do.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.280]   Come to the control room.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.600]   But it's OK because I move through.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.080]   But if I started with what you want to do about it, I get nothing.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.160]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.880]   And Trade Coffee is a great addition to your New Year routine.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.440]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.560]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.000]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.280]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.680]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.520]   for coffee. There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.320]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.760]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.800]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.600]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.880]   Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.440]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.920]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.000]   visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.560]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.080]   Allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:40.000]   Do you all remember Episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.120]   up your cooking at home?
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.640]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.040]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.880]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.200]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.720]   this episode. Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.640]   food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.360]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.400]   simplifies the process so much.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store and reheat all in
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.920]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer and oven safe too.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.160]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.600]   It is so good.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.400]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo collection they launched last
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.160]   year, you have to check it out.

[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.120]   You're going back to your submarine example, so I feel like I want to ask
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.640]   something that I think I mentioned in the intro, but you started this whole
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.440]   project with the Santa Fe with a pretty low team morale and low performance, and
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.760]   you took over this whole new model of control and communication.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.320]   And can you just share a little bit about the impact and the result that
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.800]   happened during your tenure?
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.040]   Yeah, I had less stress in my life.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:35.520]   Now, we set records for performance.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.080]   We set records for morale.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.240]   100% of our sailors signed up to stay in the Navy, which is a record.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.040]   Can't go higher than that.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.720]   And over the next 10 years, more officers on the Santa Fe became submarine
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.880]   commanders than any other submarine anyone has ever heard of.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.480]   10 from just that one group over that three-year period.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:04.520]   But the key is I was always, as a leader, so exhausted and nervous about being
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.040]   wrong.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.840]   I don't know how some of these command and control leaders do it.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.120]   They run around telling people what to do.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.240]   It's like, "Aren't you afraid you're going to be wrong?"
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.280]   I was like, "What am I missing?"
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.240]   And if I was wrong, people would die and companies go out of business and we
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.280]   pollute the environment, whatever it happens to be.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   And now I had this rich network, this sort of spider web safety net of people
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.640]   telling me what they thought all the time.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.480]   And we weren't always perfect, we weren't always right, but I just had so much
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.440]   less stress.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.840]   I always had felt like I'm always putting energy into the system as the leader.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.240]   I'm running around, making it happen.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.440]   I'm exhausted.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.040]   I'm checking on people.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.560]   I always see more.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.360]   I know more.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.240]   I could do it better.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.200]   I could do it faster.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.720]   It was exhausting and it all flipped on its head.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.600]   And it felt like the energy was coming to me all day long.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.160]   At the end of the day, I had more energy than when I started.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:07.480]   And I stopped going to all these silly meetings that were just theater.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.520]   We didn't need them.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.680]   We had meetings, but they were real.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.440]   And it was great.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.720]   Just to touch on the meetings, do you have any rules for how to get rid of the silly
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.600]   meetings or identify which ones are a waste of time?
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.680]   Because I think most of the people listening here would probably tell you that a good
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.120]   portion of their day is spent in meetings that seem like a waste.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.760]   So I guess the follow-up then is how do you convince people that?
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.240]   I never convince anyone of anything.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.760]   They already know it.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:43.320]   And we help people do the stuff they already believe in doing.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.360]   But I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't need a lot of convincing to say, "Hey,
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.600]   can we do it with fewer meetings?"
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.920]   I think vote first.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.800]   So they think, "Oh, this is going to take longer because I have to hear all these
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.520]   different opinions."
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:54.760]   No.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:03.000]   It actually is faster because you get to the actual issues way quicker.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.960]   And then the other thing is decisions aren't unilateral, and they're not forever.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.480]   So we always say, "Okay, a decision on this."
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.640]   Again, for some reason, this is the submarine decisions.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   We work with all kinds of businesses now.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:24.280]   But let's say we're in a submarine again, and we're arguing about turning north or
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.000]   south, we could argue about that all day long.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.320]   Or we could just pick, "Let's go north and see how it works."
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.400]   But knowing that we can turn around and go back south, it's not irreversible.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.480]   Now, we lost the time that we went north.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.600]   We could have been going south.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.520]   But we always keep a little bit in the back of our mind that we're going to revisit this
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:42.920]   decision.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.560]   We put an expiration date on the decision, like cheese, and we're going to revisit it.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:58.840]   And it minimizes the barriers to transitioning from the decision to the action.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.360]   You want to minimize the barriers from decision to action, and you want to minimize the barriers
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.400]   from action back to decision, because that will create an agility in your business where
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.680]   you say, "Think about it.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.720]   All in.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.080]   Work, work, work, work, work.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.280]   Time out.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.080]   Out.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.800]   Think broad perspective, and then commit in."
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.560]   And you want to have super focus.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.120]   You don't want to have, "Oh, we're in with just two toes and half my brain is thinking
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.720]   about, 'Is this really the right thing to do?'"
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.920]   That's not what you want.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.600]   And I love the approach of realizing that a reversible decision should be made faster.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.160]   I remember so many decisions we debated in the early days of my company where we were
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.720]   like, "What microwave should we buy in the office?"
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.840]   It's like, "We should just literally just bought the first microwave."
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.440]   You have these decisions that feel like you could get stuck in analysis paralysis.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.080]   And this constant reminder, for me, actually, was like a sticky note on my computer.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.760]   It was just like, "Is this reversible?"
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.680]   And if this is an easy, reversible decision, and it's low impact on the business, just
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.000]   make it.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.640]   It doesn't matter.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.000]   And then the other one, I haven't always adhered to vote first.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.200]   "Buy two microwaves.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.120]   Who cares?"
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.320]   And I haven't always adhered to vote first.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.720]   But sometimes, I've done kind of vote in the middle, which is you're in the middle of a
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.480]   discussion, you didn't vote at first, you haven't listened to this episode yet.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.040]   And you realize like, "Maybe we're all just on the same page."
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.160]   And we've done a...
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.280]   Hey, quick pause here.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.720]   Does anyone...
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.640]   And obviously, it needs to be a small group where people feel comfortable speaking up.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.000]   But if it's...
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.400]   Is anyone opposed to just doing this thing?
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.000]   And I can't tell you the number of meetings I've been in where people were just going
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.400]   around the room discussing something that we all agreed on.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.880]   And I think one of the other advantages of voting first,
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.560]   aside from just getting out opinions that you might not know, is that you might all
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.440]   agree.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.200]   And you could have just wasted 45 minutes on a meeting talking about why everyone thinks
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.800]   we should do something that we all agree on.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.600]   And we could just do it.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.280]   And you could end the meeting in two minutes.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:54.680]   Right.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.960]   So that's another one that...
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.600]   Another benefit that I found of voting first.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.880]   If everyone agrees, I would be still a little worried.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.720]   I would say, "Okay, great."
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.760]   It's like that scene in World War Z where they have like the 13th person has to disagree
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.480]   deal.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.240]   It's like, "Okay, now let's make up five reasons why this is not a good...
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:13.640]   We're still...
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.520]   Okay, we're going to do it.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.160]   But let's just come up with five reasons why this would go bad."
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.280]   Imagine we're sitting here in six months, and this has been a giant shit show.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.080]   What would be the top five reasons?
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.840]   And just game through that a little bit, maybe, if you want.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.080]   But yeah, you save a lot of time.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.440]   Bill Marris, who used to run Google Ventures where I worked, if ever the entire team voted
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:42.200]   yes on an investment, and we moved to blind voting so that we didn't have groups involved.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.040]   We actually built a piece of software where you could vote on deals and add feedback.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.880]   And he wouldn't tell people the results of the vote.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.360]   He would just come in and disagree vehemently if everyone...
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.880]   And you'd all be...
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.320]   Take the counter perspective.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:58.760]   And he felt like his role as a leader was to take the counter if everyone was supportive.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.280]   I think at least to discuss it and then, "Okay, great.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.240]   We're going to make the investment."
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.160]   But you want to explore that.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.600]   If this is such a no-brainer, why didn't someone else...
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.440]   Why hasn't someone else already bought the company?
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   It should be for sale.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:20.520]   So without even mentioning it, we moved from the story you first wrote in your first book
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:26.040]   about your experience on the Santa Fe to your most recent book, where you talk about
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:32.680]   six leadership plays that you've used revolving around the language of how you operate.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.560]   But what, after writing a bestselling book about leadership,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.800]   led you to feel the need to write another book on leadership?
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.200]   I don't know about other writers, but all my stuff starts with self-help.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   I just felt...
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:54.360]   Even at the end of the experience on the submarine, the very next day, the next year,
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.480]   five years later...
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.440]   And now I was running my company and we were interacting with these companies around the
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.440]   world, helping them change their cultures.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.360]   But it all started with me.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.280]   I kept feeling like my language was programmed by some other...
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.880]   Some evil thing in my head that made me say, "Right?
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.480]   We good?"
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.720]   Like these kind of things, phrases that I actually didn't want to say, but I was still
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.280]   saying them.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:26.520]   And so I was trying to analyze the structure and the patterns in the language and why they
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:36.440]   held so much sway over me and why they were so powerful and what I wanted to say instead.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:43.960]   We say we act our way to new thinking, but if you don't see the words that you can say...
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.800]   So if you don't realize that you could say, "How sure are you?"
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.480]   as opposed to, "Are you sure?"
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.240]   then you're just going to keep asking, "Are you sure?"
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:59.080]   If you don't realize that you could ask something simple like, "Just tell me more," as opposed
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.440]   to, "Well, let me explain," then you won't do that.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.280]   And so I feel like basically it's just a whole book of "don't say this, say that."
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.040]   It's a bunch of book of sentence starters, which is how it started.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.400]   But it turns out there's a very interesting structure behind why the language is the way
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:22.600]   we use it, is the way we say now, and what we've inherited, what we're programmed to
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.080]   say.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:30.600]   And I think there's a coherent structure in the solar system as we knew it, where the
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:35.400]   sun revolved around the earth, and the solar system as we want it, where the earth revolves
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.360]   around the sun.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.320]   I don't want to jump into all six leadership plays because you wrote a book and anyone
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.080]   listening can go read this book.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.000]   And I've done it and I encourage you.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.760]   But there's a couple I wanted to hit on.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.120]   So one is that my wife loves baking.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:54.920]   And I, unfortunately, also love baked goods, which is a terrible combination.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.720]   (laughs)
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.480]   We call that enabling behavior.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.840]   I know.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.800]   And my recommendation is always, "Hey, why don't you just not bake?"
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.240]   And she's like, "No, why don't you learn to not eat all the cookies in one sitting?"
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.160]   Just because I bake it doesn't mean you have to eat it.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.400]   I've heard that countless times.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:09.880]   Right.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.920]   And in 2021, I had bouts where I said, "You know what?
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.640]   I'm just not allowed to eat the cookies."
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:21.560]   And this year, thanks to reading your book, I've decided I am not the kind of person that
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.480]   overindulges on baked goods.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.080]   And I haven't put that to the test.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   We're only a few days into the year.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:32.600]   But can you talk about why that distinction is so important and why commitment can actually
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.200]   be more effective than compliance?
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.720]   This came from work where we looked at the language of teams that were fragile and made
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.200]   mistakes versus ones that were more resilient.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   And it's called "Leadership is Language."
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.600]   So here's a simple example.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.640]   You could say, let's say you have this self-talk about this baked good thing.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.480]   You could say, "I can't eat baked goods."
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.120]   You're sitting there, the baked goods are sitting on the table, you've already had a
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.880]   slice of bread, you don't want to eat more.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.080]   "Oh, I can't eat that."
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.160]   Versus, "I don't eat that."
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:05.640]   And you want to say, "I don't eat baked goods."
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.120]   For me, I don't think it's binary.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.720]   It's not like you're never going to eat a baked good.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.160]   But I don't eat a lot.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.600]   So it's just a subliminal thing.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:18.360]   But the reason why I don't eat it—studies show when people say, "I don't do something,"
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.400]   they have a higher rate of sticking with their commitment than when they say, "I can't."
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:23.640]   Why?
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.320]   Because when they say, "I can't," it's this outside force that's imposing on me
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.960]   that you can't, you shouldn't do it, you can't do it.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:36.120]   Versus when you say, "You don't do it," you're giving yourself agency over your life.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:43.480]   You're tapping into your own intrinsic desire to control your life and say, "I don't eat.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.400]   I don't go to those kind of meetings.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.360]   I don't eat baked.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.760]   I don't eat that," or that kind of thing.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.200]   Now—and no one can argue with you.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.600]   If I go to my mom and I say, "Mom, oh, I can't eat.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.800]   Oh, no, you look fine.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.240]   You're not going to—oh, just a little bit."
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.840]   Like, she's arguing with me when I say, "No, I don't eat that."
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.720]   There's nothing to say.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:12.680]   Okay, so you want to use language as much as possible that makes you powerful as opposed
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.480]   to powerless.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:19.240]   And that's why you want to say to yourself, "I don't do whatever it is that you're trying
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.920]   not to do," as opposed to, "I can't do it."
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.520]   I'm just now realizing how much more effective "don't" is in a peer pressure situation
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.680]   of, "Gosh, I just—I can't have another drink tonight.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.720]   I've been drinking this week."
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.120]   And it's like, your friends are like, "Nah, nah, you can't."
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.920]   And then if you have a friend who doesn't drink, they're at the table, they're like,
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.560]   "I don't drink."
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.160]   And no one's pushing them.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.720]   They're just sitting there totally fine with whatever.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.080]   Yeah, imagine that.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.320]   Like, the person—that's what they say.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.160]   They don't say, "Oh, I can't drink."
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.200]   They say, "I don't drink."
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.280]   And that's like, boom, shut down.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.240]   Great, I respect that.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:51.800]   You have a code.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.180]   Exactly.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.560]   I don't drink more than—or whatever it is.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.680]   I don't drink after 11.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.960]   I don't drink after two drinks.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.360]   I don't drink.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   Or I don't drink and drive—like, I don't drink and drive.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.000]   Not, "I can't drink and drive," because obviously you could drink and drive, but—
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.760]   I've had situations where I'm like, "You know what?
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.880]   I just don't want to drink tonight."
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.120]   And instead of just being more, you know, a sort of having—saying, "I don't do that,"
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.720]   I would just drive intentionally.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.920]   So I could say, "Oh, I drove here.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.480]   I can't drink."
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.320]   You know, like, "I don't drink and drive."
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:20.760]   That was my, like, out, was if I just drove, then I could absolve myself of any peer pressure.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.000]   Because it's socially—that's okay.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.760]   Like, it's, "Oh, well, you have an excuse not to drink."
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.840]   So we all respect—we understand and respect that.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.360]   Versus, "I'm not drinking tonight," or whatever it happens to be.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.080]   - Yeah.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.640]   How does this kind of play in the role of work and organizations?
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:47.400]   - So much of the language we use has subtle markers of the industrial age structure,
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.400]   where leaders made decisions and got the team to do it.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:56.120]   In the industrial age, you want people to comply and keep moving forward.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:05.160]   We want the assembly line to run as long as possible, because any stoppages are lost output.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:12.440]   When Ford was building Model T, the assembly line essentially ran—it ran for almost 15 years,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   into the '20s, by which time the country had changed.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.000]   There was a lot more wealth, and it was an old, tired thing.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.800]   And then they had to shut down for, like, three months.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.320]   And GM, at this point, was building flashier cars, which were in vogue.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.280]   And then GM—GM should have never caught up.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   They should have never—they should never be in business, if Ford had done it right.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:39.320]   But it was because of this opening, and so now it's been neck-and-neck ever since.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:47.240]   So one of the things I hear a lot are people say things—they say some version of,
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:52.280]   "Does that make sense? Are we good? We're all good here? Everyone happy?"
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.560]   Something like that.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:59.400]   And we say it more times than we even realize we were saying it.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.840]   I say it.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:06.600]   And then you say, "Well, why did we say that? Why did I say, 'Oh, so we're going to turn north,
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.320]   right? We all look good to launch the product, okay?
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:14.440]   So the product launch will happen as scheduled next Wednesday. Everybody happy?'"
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:19.080]   It's because it's a vestige of this coercion and compliance.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.920]   It just makes it a little bit harder for someone to say, "No, I'm not happy,"
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:31.640]   and to get compliance from the team, as opposed to what I'm trying—what I try to say is,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:39.160]   "How could this be wrong? Hey, next month we have this scheduled launch of this product.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.760]   This is kind of what I wish Boeing had done. Hey, how could this go wrong?
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:49.960]   How are we feeling about the project?" as opposed to this inevitability towards making it happen.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.920]   So you want to listen to those little language markers for you and remove them,
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.440]   and actually go the opposite.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:02.120]   Every time your instinct is to say, "Is that wrong? No." Or, "How could that be wrong?"
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:07.640]   Ask it in a neutral way, which invites the other opinion.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.880]   It's already hard to disagree—to be the person who disagrees with the group for the box.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.560]   That's hard. So rather than making that harder, let me make that easier.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.320]   I also want to talk about one of the other leadership plays about
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.560]   taking time to pause and reflect and fixing that into a project.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.720]   And you talk about it in saying, "Complete, not just continue."
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.440]   Why is this important? And how do you determine when to schedule those kind of completions?
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.640]   If we never complete, then you never celebrate.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:49.480]   If you never celebrate, you never reinforce fun and the reasons why we do things.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:55.800]   And it just becomes—in the Navy we say, "SSDD," which means "same stuff, different day."
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:59.000]   And everything just runs into the next day.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.600]   The problem with that is we're trying to do two different things with our brains.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:09.080]   One is we're trying to be focused on tasks.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:17.000]   I'm coding. I'm swimming. I'm bringing a SEAL team onto the submarine.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.120]   It requires focus. It requires excluding distractors.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:27.000]   The other thing we're trying to do with our brain is to make decisions.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.960]   How should we bring the SEAL team on the submarine?
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.520]   How are we going to do that? And what did we learn from the last time we did it?
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.960]   We complete this period of activity and then we want to pause and reflect.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.520]   This requires an expansive view.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.920]   It requires raising our head up, looking left and right, broadening our perspective,
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.520]   bringing in those things which otherwise we would find, quote, "distraction."
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:55.480]   In short, it's about avoiding variability and being allergic to variability when we
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.000]   want to be focused and on tasks.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.080]   And then it's about embracing variability when we're in the thinking space.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:07.320]   If you don't make it clear, are we in one side or the other,
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:12.200]   then you're always in the middle and you're neither optimized for focused work and you're
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:17.720]   not optimized for thinking work and you get muddled thinking and half-committed action.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:24.600]   So what we think is really important to make it clear, okay, we're thinking,
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.920]   we're broadening our perspective, and you have to release the pressure of the clock
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:36.680]   because it's that time pressure that shrinks our perspective and our prefrontal cortex ability to
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.800]   take in all these inputs and we just see what's in front of us.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:44.040]   And we've all done these activities where, like, the gorilla walks across the basketball
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.000]   court and you don't even see it because you're counting the number of balls, those kind of
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:47.500]   things.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.440]   So we have to release the pressure of the time.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.440]   The leader is the person who has to do that.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:58.120]   The team is going to want to commit, they're going to want to persist in their actions
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.600]   because that's what they're paid to do and deliver something.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.560]   The leader is going to say, "Time out, everyone put your pencils down, I want to make sure
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.840]   we're on track, see how everyone's doing, how do we think about what we've done, what
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.440]   we want to make decisions about the future."
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:17.320]   Now, you can do that, you can just call an audible on that, but we think it's probably
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.520]   better to schedule those.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.960]   Agile, for example, Agile software development kind of has this baked in with these sprint
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:29.320]   cycles and then allows you, also, you can celebrate, pause, reflect on what you've
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:33.400]   done, you celebrate, make commitments about the future and move on.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.440]   And are there situations where, or I guess, what is the downside of not doing this?
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:43.720]   Are there companies or projects that never took the time to pause and complete and just
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.320]   kept continuing that kind of probably regret it based on the outcomes?
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.040]   Yeah, sure.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:55.080]   Kodak kept making print film, Blockbuster kept running DVDs, as opposed to, like, there's
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:01.400]   a story Andy Grove tells in "Only the Paranoid Survived" during the Intel.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:08.120]   Now, this is after he and Gordon Moore, they'd founded this company, it was going very, very
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:15.560]   well, they were rich, and they were making storage, basically memory storage.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.760]   And memory storage, at this point, was becoming a commodity because the Japanese and Koreans
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.600]   were getting into it, and it was just becoming a commoditized product.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:33.480]   And they ran an experiment, they said, "Imagine we got fired and a new team, CEO, president,
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:34.680]   was brought in.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:40.520]   The decision they needed to make was do a shift out of storage and go to microprocessors.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.120]   What would they do?"
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.200]   And they said, "Well, that'd be easy.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.680]   We'd get out of storage and go to microprocessors."
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:53.160]   But storage is why they were rich, why they were successful, why Intel was the company
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:53.640]   it was.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:59.240]   But because they had made the decision, their psyches were connected to those decisions,
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.760]   and they had to distance themselves.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.520]   And they did it through this thought experiment, which was genius.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.680]   And they said, "Well, that's obvious."
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.320]   And then so that's when they made the shift, and they came out with the 8088, the processors,
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.640]   and that's the Intel you know today.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.280]   And is it possible to make those completions too frequent?
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.240]   We can overdrive the process.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.200]   So for example, if I say, "Hey, let's run an experiment."
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.240]   So for example, so here's what happened to my company.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.520]   Okay, we're going to redesign the website, for example.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.640]   And then we're going to make a commitment.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.800]   New design, we're going to watch it for two months, take data, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.080]   We're going to make another redesign.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.480]   Redesign the website, we launch it.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.240]   Now we're in the data.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.200]   Two weeks goes by.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.720]   I go to an event, a conference, I give a speech, but there's other speakers there.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.880]   And so I'm here sitting in the room, and one guy's talking about website design.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.600]   And I have all these ideas I write down, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.560]   I go back.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.160]   Now it's only been two weeks, but I have all these ideas.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.280]   And I start telling him, "No, no, we need to do this.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:06.840]   I can see.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.680]   Oh, no, we may have got to make this happen.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.320]   Oh, it's overdriving the process."
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:18.200]   So on the one hand, we want to deliberately inject points for changing course.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.600]   But on the other hand, we also deliberately protect against changing course while we're
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.200]   in the decision-making process.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.880]   And I'm not going to say never do it.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.080]   It might be time to change.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.800]   Don't look up.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.280]   All of a sudden, there's a comet coming to hit the earth.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.960]   Yeah, maybe we should reevaluate.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.400]   Let's not wait for the next two weeks.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.160]   But I call that the good idea, Ferry.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:48.520]   So A, you protect the team from being whipsawing, because then you never stabilize the experiment.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:55.560]   I'm a little bit allergic to the phrase "continuous improvement," because it implies
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.160]   I'm just continually tweaking the process, which I don't think is the right way to do it.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:05.000]   I think you want to do some batch tweaks, and then measure performance, and then batch
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.840]   tweaks, and measure performance.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:13.400]   And so it's "continue us," or it's incremental in that way, and it doesn't ever end.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:20.760]   So in that sense, it's continuous or continual, but we're not always tweaking things.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.560]   The last leadership play I want to touch on, and there are a few we didn't hit that you
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.000]   all should check out, was all about connecting with the team.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.280]   And it reminded me a bit of the book "Radical Candor."
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.640]   And I just want to know what role you think emotions have in decision-making and leadership.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.320]   All decisions are emotional.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.080]   If we didn't have emotion, we would be unable to make a decision.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.880]   We wouldn't make a decision.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.360]   We would do things, they might look like decisions, but they're not decisions.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.880]   So if I'm looking at an ant, and it runs three inches that way, and turns left and
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.600]   runs four inches that way, it didn't decide to do that.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.040]   It just did it through its innate programming.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:15.560]   When people have suffered brain damage, which removes their ability to feel emotions, it's
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.560]   linked with an inability to make decisions.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:27.320]   And I tell a story about a patient that Dr. Demasio, who's a neurosurgeon, had where
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.240]   they did—and this is exactly what happened.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.760]   We know that all decision-making, basically the wiring for your decision-making calculus
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.320]   in your brain passes through an emotional part of your brain.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.840]   That's why we move from description to assessment, then action, because action involves
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.800]   decision-making.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.320]   Let's say I'm trying to buy a new house.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.160]   One of the things that my wife and I like to do is watch these house-hunting shows,
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.080]   and we try and guess which house they're going to buy.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.600]   I spend more time than you—I've watched a lot of these.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.480]   Never once does someone say, "Well, I've run the numbers, and this house has this
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.560]   square footage, and this, and this, and this, and this, so it's the right house to buy."
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.760]   Okay, let's get it.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.760]   It's never like that.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:15.320]   I have 100% prediction ability because I ignore whatever the man says.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.600]   And this irritates my wife, but it's always whatever the woman says, that's what they're
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.000]   going to get.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.720]   And it's always something like, "Hey, I can see our family."
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.400]   It's an emotional thing.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.040]   So all decisions at the end of the day, because they involve the future, are emotional.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.600]   And yeah, you want data.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.560]   And so if we don't have a healthy emotional environment at work, we can't make healthy
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.200]   decisions.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.960]   And if we don't have an emotional environment at work for 80% of the people who work there,
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.280]   then 80% of the people are not going to contribute to the decision-making ability of the
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.400]   organization.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.480]   And I like to ask leaders, "What did it cost for you to make this decision?"
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.480]   Like, I hold up, "What do you make?"
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.400]   I make pens, like the one I'm holding in my hand.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.000]   "What did it cost for this, this, this, this?"
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:04:59.720]   "Oh, I can tell you.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.000]   It's a .01 penny."
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.320]   "But what did it cost for you to make the decision that you're going to make this pen?"
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.760]   "No idea."
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.360]   "That you're going to market in the following ways?"
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:10.920]   "No idea."
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.880]   "That you're selling it on Amazon, but not on whatever?"
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:19.160]   No, we don't know to orders of magnitude what it costs to make decisions in our company,
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.320]   but as a product, as an output, we should know.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.680]   And once you start thinking about it, you're like, "Well, the higher the decision is made
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.600]   in the company, the more it costs me, because I'm paying a senior vice president who makes
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:37.000]   500 grand to make a decision, whereas the guy across the street is paying the floor
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.840]   manager who makes 120 grand to make that decision.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.560]   They're going to win."
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.160]   So think about the cost of your decisions.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.360]   Get them as low as possible.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.720]   All right.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.960]   So I feel like everything else, definitely check out the book.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.280]   But I do want to say, if someone's listening and they're not in the leadership role to
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:01.480]   make a lot of these changes themselves, what can they do to help push an organization towards
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.000]   a more healthy set of languages and a more productive team?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.680]   The cool thing is you can just start doing stuff.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.480]   You just stop asking people, "Are you sure?"
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.720]   You just start asking, "Hey, how sure are you?"
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.720]   You start using probabilistic language.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.120]   You start with your team at your level.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:26.520]   Now, one of the questions I get is, "What if my boss is this way, and it's very stressful
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.600]   for me because they keep telling me what to do.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.440]   They don't really care what I think."
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:35.880]   And if I'm in a bad mood, I'll say, "Well, you should quit, because the toll on your
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.440]   life and your health is not worth whatever it is you're making from this job."
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.280]   It might feel like it is.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.440]   "Well, my kid's about to go to college."
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.680]   You'll be dead.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.680]   But a more helpful answer is it's always about safety.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.120]   Safety for you, but safety for them.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:00.840]   When you go to your boss and you say, "Hey, I have an idea about how to do this thing
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.880]   you told us to do a little bit better," or maybe not even do it at all, it becomes a
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.640]   contest of authority, which immediately provokes their defense mechanisms.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.960]   So what we would advise is to say, "Hey, this is your call.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.680]   You want us to do this?
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:15.240]   We're going to do it."
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.400]   And then what's the sequence?
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   Description, assessment, action.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.320]   Would you like to know—choice—how we see it?
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.600]   Description.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.120]   Don't jump to action, because that's too far.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.960]   That's too much vulnerability for you and them.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.760]   So we start with description, safe.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.280]   And again, remember, also one, some, all.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.720]   So it's just you and me in this room.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.000]   So you can tell me to pack sand, no one's losing face, that kind of thing.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.360]   Then, once you earn the right to be heard, then you can have influence.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.920]   And I did this wrong so many times.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.080]   That's why I'm such an expert on pissing my boss off.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:59.320]   But it sounds like the playbook for someone not in the leadership role is to just do the
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   same things from beneath.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.320]   And you mentioned earlier that it takes a lot of mental stress out of your head to be
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.160]   in a leadership role like this.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.880]   By starting to do that, maybe you can encourage someone to feel that and perpetuate it.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.080]   Yeah, but I don't want to take quitting off the table.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.600]   That's always got to be on the table.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.960]   I'm not in the Navy anymore.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.400]   At some point, it was great for me for a while, but at some point it became not a good environment
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.640]   for me, so I'm not there.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.400]   The leader's job is to create the environment where people can be at their best just the
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.280]   way they are.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.040]   It might mean putting someone in a different environment, and it might mean you.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.920]   You're not good in this environment.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.120]   Be in a different environment.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.280]   Don't say, "What do I need to do to be great here?"
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.160]   Say, "Where do I need to be so that I'll be great the way I am?"
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.680]   I agree a lot of people don't put quitting on the table.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.760]   Well, it's happening a lot more now.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.480]   This has been fantastic.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.640]   Aside from the books, where can people find out what you're working on and get in touch?
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.920]   Yeah, YouTube channel, Leadership Nudges.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.000]   I put these little one to two minute things out.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.680]   Give me your comments.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.720]   Give me your thoughts.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.480]   The little tidbits, a lot of things that we've talked about, One Sum All or Describe, Assess,
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.320]   Act, those kinds of things.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.000]   And then companies called Intempus Leadership International.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:23.880]   That's our movement.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.000]   And you can go on LinkedIn.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.960]   We have a website.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.600]   You can go on LinkedIn and let us know what you think.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.400]   Tell us your story.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.360]   I will also post a link in the show notes to the original video that I've shared dozens
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:34.760]   of times.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.880]   David, thank you for being here.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.240]   Yeah, thanks so much.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.400]   And thank you, listeners, for what you guys do.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.280]   Leadership is hard.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.520]   It's often about going against your innate wiring.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.720]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.400]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:56.360]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:02.040]   I would really appreciate it, especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.960]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.200]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.240]   That's it for this week.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.120]   I'll see you next week.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:26.040]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.880]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.440]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.760]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.040]   to save a dollar.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.200]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.320]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.160]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.040]   But recently, I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.840]   your mind.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.880]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.480]   employer's retirement plan.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.160]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.880]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.720]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.400]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.480]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.120]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.040]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
