[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.800]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.600]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to help you upgrade your life, money, travel, and more.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.080]   Now, I'm sure we all have that favorite article or video that we've all read
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.360]   and we've watched a dozen times and shared to countless people.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.520]   I can't remember how I came across mine first,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.960]   but for me, it's a talk from David Marquet about leadership.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   And when I was running my last startup, I watched it every few months
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.680]   and sent it to so many friends and colleagues in leadership roles.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.520]   So if you sense a bit of excitement in my voice, it's because I'm joined by David himself today.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.240]   And for those of you who don't know him, David Marquet is a distinguished submarine captain
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.920]   who, as commander of the USS Santa Fe, took the ship and its crew
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.640]   from being one of the worst-performing in the Navy to the most combat-effective ship in the squadron.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.760]   He documented that journey in an incredible best-selling book, Turn the Ship Around,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.400]   which was listed as one of the 12 best business books of all time.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.000]   And he followed that up in 2020 with another best-selling book, Leadership is Language.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.880]   In our conversation, we'll dive into the unique perspective he has on leadership
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.760]   and break down the tactics you can apply to your own lives,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.800]   whether you're at the top or bottom of your organization.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.480]   All right, we have a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.800]   David, thank you for being here. How are you?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.760]   Good, Chris. Thanks for having me on your show. Welcome, all listeners.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.520]   So, I would just love to start by hearing how your definition of leadership has evolved
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.600]   since you first started thinking about it.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   My definition of leadership was handed to me, like in the Navy,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.520]   if they want you to have something, they're going to give it to you.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.040]   If they haven't given it to you, you don't need it.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.640]   So, my definition of leadership started like this.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.680]   Leadership can be defined as directing the thoughts, plans, and actions of others
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.120]   so as to command their obedience, confidence, and thorough respect.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.640]   Basically, something like that.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.840]   But it was about this, it was in this model of the leader is the decision-maker,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.480]   the leader is the brains of the organization, and the team is the body.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.200]   The team executes what the leader wants.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.960]   And it's a model that got the human race a long way.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.720]   It was a model that was alive during the Industrial Revolution.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.480]   It was a model that a lot of people cling to, because there's psychological seductions in the model
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720]   when you're the leader and everyone thinks you're important,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.080]   and they got to stand and wait for your word, and that kind of thing.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.840]   But it's not the best model for the highest-performing teams on the planet today, in my opinion.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.760]   I had to learn the hard way that the model didn't work.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.040]   When the Navy assigned me as submarine commander to a submarine I'd never been on before,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.640]   I'd finished this 12-month course for the submarine I was supposed to go to,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.760]   but at the last minute, through some circumstances, I ended up going to Santa Fe,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.120]   and I'd never been on this kind of submarine.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.880]   And so now it was a life-and-death thing.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.040]   It was like, every time I gave an order, it was an X probability we were going to die,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.080]   because it could be right, it could be wrong.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.200]   The team was going to do it anyway.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   And I had to unlearn all my leadership behavior.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.280]   So leadership to me now is much more like creating the environment
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.520]   where people can be at their best, just the way they are.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.280]   Not changing people, not saying, "Well, you need to be more proactive,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.920]   and you need to have more assertiveness," but just,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.480]   "You want to change someone? Change yourself. Work on that."
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.240]   So it's always about other people, and it's about creating the environment.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.920]   So the question is, under what conditions are humans at our best?
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   Under what conditions are you at your best?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.920]   And that's what you want to do in your company,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.080]   because then everyone will be at their best.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.040]   They'll be at their best human, which I think means using our brains a lot.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.000]   And it'll be awesome for everybody.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.400]   I want to talk about some of those tactics,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.680]   but was there a moment on the Santa Fe that you said, "Wow, this has to change"?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.880]   Well, yeah, there was.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.360]   Of course, I knew that I hadn't been on the submarine,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960]   and the crew knew that I was trained for a different...
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.160]   I mean, because the captain quit before me.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.520]   They got airdropped in with basically no notice.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.600]   But I was standing in the control room.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.760]   We were starting a drill.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.280]   This was our first day at sea, and the submarine had a bad reputation.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.560]   So my mindset was, "Oh, we're going to train hard.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.720]   We're going to run all these hard drills on ourselves,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.200]   and we're going to beat performance into the ship,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.560]   and then maybe people will be happier," because there was two problems.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.760]   Horrible morale, horrible performance.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.520]   So we start the first exercise.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.640]   We shut down the reactor, it's called reactor scram.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.680]   And reactor scram, and then you don't have power.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.320]   You're depleting your battery.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.680]   Guys are running around, and I want to make it harder.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.120]   So I say, "Hey, let's speed up on the backup electric motor."
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.480]   And the officer orders it.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.800]   Well, it turns out it was only a one-speed motor on the Santa Fe.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.960]   The Navy always moves towards simpler equipment.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.560]   So instead of a two-speed motor, like having two gears on your car,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   it's just one.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.560]   It's like a fixie for a bicyclist.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.760]   And I didn't know that, but the scary thing is,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.880]   the officer who I suggested it to ordered it.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.040]   And then the sailor just looked stupefied,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.240]   and he said, "There's no second gear."
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.640]   (laughs)
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.840]   And this is like not knowing what the color of your car is or something.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.680]   It's like one of the most basic things you need to know
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.800]   as a submarine commander.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.080]   And I had made this horrendous mistake.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   I was embarrassed, and I was sad, and I had this light bulb moment.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.200]   Number one, I didn't order it, he did.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.600]   Number two, all my leadership training was irrelevant,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.880]   because all my leadership training was about making decisions
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.720]   and getting people to do it.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.240]   It's all predicated in being right.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.640]   And then, oh, in the unlikely event that I'm not correct,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.880]   I'm going to harangue the team and say,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.920]   "Oh, it's your obligation to speak up and tell me I'm wrong."
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.800]   Problem is, as long as you make it harder for people to do something,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.120]   they're going to do it less.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.440]   So step one, the first tactic is shut up.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.480]   Stop telling people what to do.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.520]   There's so many negative things that happen
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.560]   from telling people what to do.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.600]   You give them permission to shut your brains off,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.640]   you absolve them of responsibility for their behaviors,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.520]   on and on and on.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.200]   So you just don't tell them what to do.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.840]   Say, "Well, you tell me.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.760]   "If you were me, what would you do?
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.440]   "If you were the captain, what would you do?"
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.200]   And so we just embed this language,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.400]   and it was, for us, the magic word was intent.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.040]   I said, "Just stop saying, 'I would like permission to,'
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.240]   "stop saying, 'I hope to,'
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.440]   "stop saying, 'Would you approve it for me to do this?'
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.600]   "Just say, 'This is what I intend to do.'"
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   And now the bias is the answer is yes,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.040]   unless you hear no,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.400]   as opposed to the answer is no, unless you hear yes.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.120]   And this has a huge impact.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.800]   The second thing is it puts you in the role
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.040]   of evaluating decisions rather than making decisions,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.520]   which is much more powerful.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.760]   - I tried this at my company.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.840]   I just said, you know, someone's saying,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   "Oh, what should we do here?"
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.680]   I said, "What do you think we should do here?"
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.520]   And I think it went well.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.480]   It's easier, I guess, when you don't have an answer.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.400]   When you don't know the answer, you genuinely have to ask.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.920]   A lot of times, people do have an answer
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.520]   or do have an opinion, and it's a little harder,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.160]   and it takes some reinforcement.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.560]   But when you told the team,
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.920]   "Hey, I'm not gonna make any decisions.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.600]   "It's on you," did everyone get it?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.440]   - No.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.840]   I got the officers together, and I was shaken
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.360]   because this was visceral.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.720]   This was life and death.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.840]   We know teams where the leader will make a decision.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.560]   It'll be a terrible decision, but everyone does it.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.440]   Wintercorn, CEO of Volkswagen,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.840]   we're gonna do this thing with the diesel engines.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.040]   It's a, you can't.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.200]   So the team goes through all these things,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.960]   cheats of a horrible reputation,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.720]   but they're absolved of the responsibility
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   because they were told to.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   Now, he'll say, "I didn't actually tell them that."
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.680]   Yeah, but you set it up, so that was the only way.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.640]   Anyway, you know the story.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.480]   We got together.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.560]   I was looking at my shoes.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.880]   They were looking at their shoes.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   I said, "We got a problem."
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.360]   And I hit on this idea where I'm gonna be
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.040]   this commanding officer of the submarine
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.920]   and never give any commands.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.760]   I said, "Because as soon as I start telling you guys
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.440]   "what I think, it's just, it's not gonna be binary,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   "but it's just gonna be harder for you to speak up
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   "and tell me what you think.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.040]   "So how about this?
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.800]   "You tell me what you think first,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.840]   "and then I'll tell you yes or no."
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   And the majority of people wanted it right away.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.960]   Even I, but no one really understood the implications.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.280]   I can't say, "Watch this movie
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.400]   "and you'll get a sense of what it was like."
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.480]   Every movie, I just finished watching this thing,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.080]   the BB, I don't know if it's,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.520]   but it's a UK thing on vigil.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.640]   It's hideous.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.480]   It's horrible.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   The way they portray the Navy, it's just the worst,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.160]   the most horrible, nonsensical, this would never happen.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.720]   But one thing that they portray, which is correct,
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.240]   is the captain's going around giving all these orders.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.360]   Like he's always telling people,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.520]   he never once sees someone come to the cabin and say,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.100]   "Captain, this is what I intend to do.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.320]   "Captain, we really need to do this."
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.720]   And why?
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.680]   'Cause it's a drama.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.080]   The camera has to go someplace,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.680]   but that's not the right way to run a company
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.560]   because it's, you just get thinking of one
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.920]   versus the thinking of everyone.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.160]   But one of the things we say is don't convince people,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.600]   commit behaviors, not action.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.720]   So I was talking to two owners,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.240]   two company founders for the show,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.880]   and they said, "Hey, we've got a situation
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.440]   "where one of the guys on the team
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.980]   "is coming up with a wrong answer
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.280]   "for how to manage a technology product."
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.920]   And they're reluctant to just tell them what to do,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.480]   which I can't sense that,
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.040]   but it's okay to sometimes do that.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.280]   They said, "Well, how much do we explain?"
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.800]   And so they said, "I wanna tell them this
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.420]   "when I tell them to do it this way."
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.760]   And like everything that the person cited,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.040]   if we're gonna use this other platform,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.360]   this platform's just bigger.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.520]   Okay, if you get the person to test,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.640]   and you said, "Is this platform bigger?"
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.440]   And every question would be right.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.040]   So none of those reasons
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.600]   are the reasons why the person's not doing it.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.400]   There's some other reason.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.920]   But in the end, you don't need to convince them
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.760]   they're wrong, that's really derogatory.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.180]   Say, "You know what, you might be right,
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.560]   "but we're gonna do it this way."
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.920]   Now, you leave as much open decision space as possible.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   So I'm not adverse to leaders, quote, making decisions,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.160]   but there's two things.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.080]   Number one, your focus of your decision
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.340]   should be on building ownership and creating the structure,
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.960]   not tweaking the decisions.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.320]   If you think about it like a car,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.000]   let's say we're making cars, we start a car company.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.920]   The old way was we put an inspector
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.000]   at the end of the assembly line.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.220]   You say, "Hey, car, defect, refix, car, good, sell,
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.020]   "car, car, sell, sell, sell, defect."
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.620]   And that's how we view ourselves
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.060]   as leaders making decisions.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.140]   "Oh, I'm gonna be the guy
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.900]   "who's the quality inspector for decisions."
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.420]   As opposed to baking in an assembly line
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.820]   so that the processes in my company
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.940]   just inherently result in better,
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.660]   more resilient, adaptive decisions,
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.580]   and I can get out of the business
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.800]   of being that quality inspector.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.120]   But the cost is I don't get the psychological juice
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.400]   of everyone on bended knee trying to understand,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.840]   "Oh, what's Jack Welch telling us to do today?"
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.640]   - If people are empowered to make the decisions,
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.360]   but management overrides them, does it make it harder?
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.800]   Or how do you resolve situations
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.480]   where you're giving the team
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.280]   the kind of length of rope to run with it,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.520]   but they're coming up with the wrong answer?
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.240]   Obviously you can coach them, but how do you handle that?
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.260]   - Almost all the decisions that we make
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260]   are reversible or tweakable.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.260]   So, in our heads, we have this unspoken structure
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:57.180]   that we make decisions for all time
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.140]   and they're either work or don't work.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.980]   And it's very binary.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.260]   And it's not like that in my opinion.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.660]   Every decision is really a hypothesis.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.220]   If we do this, then that.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.240]   And then, so what you do is say,
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   "Okay, so this decision is we are going to try this
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.460]   "whatever for a month, or try it this way for a month.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.740]   "See what we learn, then we'll tweak it."
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.740]   Which may possibly mean scrapping it,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.120]   but generally it means tweaking it and improving it.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.780]   But it puts people, number one, it's not so heavy.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.500]   We're not saying, "Oh, we're having initiative.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.620]   "From now on, we're gonna use Slack."
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.540]   And nothing, everyone goes, "Oh my gosh."
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.340]   So we say, "Hey, let's try this.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.580]   "We're gonna run Slack for a month, see what we learn."
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.020]   And then it puts people in a learning mindset.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.540]   And then they also have a sense
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.380]   that they can control their outcome.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.660]   Because I'm gonna be interested in what you learn
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.380]   so that we can tweak how we use Slack,
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.180]   whatever it happens to be.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.300]   - That means sometimes, as a leader,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.940]   it's worth letting someone do something
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.700]   that you think might be wrong
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.540]   just to go through the process of learning?
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that depends on how.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.460]   I wouldn't let, the engineer comes up and says,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.620]   "Hey, I have a new idea for starting the reactor."
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.420]   You're like, "Yeah, no."
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.260]   Things that involve the laws of physics,
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.420]   I would not do a lot of experimentation on.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   If they involve humans, then yeah.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.980]   I like to think how we manage vacation
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.300]   or who's on the project team
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.220]   or how we select the project teams
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.780]   or how often do they meet or what's the, things like that.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.900]   There's no laws of physics that are gonna be violated.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.940]   If we say, "Okay, everyone's just working at home."
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.180]   Or, "Everyone work in the office."
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.820]   Or, "Half the people work in the office."
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.580]   Fine, let's just try it, see what happens.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.820]   It's not like deciding, for example,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.180]   the software on an airplane
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.140]   where people die if it's wrong, for example.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.220]   - And you talk a bit in your first book
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.020]   about needing competence and clarity within the org.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.420]   So a couple of things that I took away
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.620]   are making sure everyone's hearing the same message,
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.220]   repeating the message, specifying goals, not methods.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.260]   Are there other kind of big takeaways there
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.980]   of things that can reinforce a new model of control?
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.620]   - Yeah, so one of the things I learned was,
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.020]   as you're giving people the authority to make decisions,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.260]   they're not always gonna make the right decision.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.740]   And there's limits to it.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.140]   There's a right and a wrong way to do it.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.460]   For me, the two input variables,
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.100]   since you're a fellow mathlete, you'll get this.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.180]   The two input variables for me
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.500]   were technical competence and organizational clarity.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.100]   So in other words,
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.100]   the function of how much control I'm gonna give you
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.980]   is a function of how much technical competence you have,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.260]   how much understanding of what we're trying to do you have,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.300]   and then plus this tiny, I call it the Z factor,
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.220]   which is like a growth factor, plus Z.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.060]   So in other words, if I can perfectly tune
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.340]   your decision-making authority to your skills,
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.740]   that's not what you want.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.380]   You actually wanna do a little bit more
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.740]   'cause that's where the growth happens.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.380]   And you want people to be excited about,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.740]   oh, look, I'm learning new things.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.740]   Oh, look, I'm making bigger decisions.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.700]   You want that sense of progress.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.540]   Otherwise, it becomes static and no one wants to play there.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.100]   - Which seems a little counter to a common idea
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.500]   of give this person control once they've earned it
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.940]   and demonstrated that they can handle it.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.820]   Is that turning it on the table and say,
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.340]   no, give them more control and see if they can handle it?
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.380]   - Yeah, so when my daughter was growing up,
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.900]   for example, she wanted a later bedtime.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.780]   So her bedtime was at nine.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.700]   And she wants to stay up to midnight.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.940]   So I said, okay, once you demonstrate the ability
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.900]   to stay up to midnight,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.020]   I'll then extend your bedtime to midnight.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.020]   And that is the stupid, this isn't,
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.580]   well, how can I demonstrate the ability if I don't?
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.300]   But you don't also say, fine, stay up to midnight
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.260]   for whatever, what you say to me as a parent is,
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.140]   great, let's run an experiment for the next two weeks.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.700]   You can stay up to midnight.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.220]   We'll see how you do.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.460]   And then in two weeks, we're gonna have a meeting.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.620]   We're gonna talk about it.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.860]   And you're gonna tell me what you learned.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.700]   I'll tell you what I learned.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.660]   And we're gonna tweak the experiment,
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.860]   which including maybe going back to nine o'clock.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.220]   But you don't pump up a balloon inside a box.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.100]   And then when the balloon's pumped up, make a bigger box.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.380]   You make a bigger box,
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.580]   and then the balloon can grow into that bigger box.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.140]   And then you, that's what you do.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.020]   You gotta make the box bigger
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.980]   so that the person can grow into it.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.420]   - And if you let people make decisions in an org,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.740]   and you're no longer the one making decisions,
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.740]   does it abdicate the leader of ever being wrong?
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.660]   Or what happens there?
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.460]   - No, because you're still responsible.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.100]   You still have a chance to veto it.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.540]   So for example, someone says,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.340]   'cause something happened in my company recently
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.220]   where someone said, "Hey, I wanna try this."
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.380]   Oh, this is gonna,
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.740]   I was on travel in a faraway place in an overwater bungalow
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.540]   and a significant client wanted an event.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.580]   And we contacted the place and said,
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.820]   "What kind of bandwidth do you have?"
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.140]   "Oh, great, you can do all kinds of,
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.220]   you can do an online Zoom event from wherever."
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.420]   Bottom line was it didn't work
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.940]   because they didn't have the bandwidth
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.580]   and the internet was not stable enough.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.740]   Now, I technically didn't make this decision.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.420]   My team said, "Hey, we think you can do it.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.260]   We think it'll work.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.460]   So we tend to go for it."
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.220]   But I had a chance to veto it.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.500]   So I'm still wrong.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.820]   It was a harebrained idea in retrospect.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.140]   (laughing)
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.980]   But what I liked was the team had a bias for action,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.860]   a bias for doing stuff as opposed to like,
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.340]   "Oh no, we can't."
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.900]   There's just too much of that in my mind.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.420]   So I think every once in a while, you gotta push it.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.420]   So I didn't feel bad, but hey, it's still your fault.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.020]   I do think you should know your job,
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.900]   but it's like you said.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.220]   It's when you know the decision
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.660]   or you quote, "Think you know,"
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.420]   that it's so hard not to tell people what to do
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.660]   because there's a sense of urgency.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.980]   So I always try and say,
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.980]   "Just tell me more, buy myself some time."
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.820]   "Oh, tell me more."
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.020]   Especially when what you hear sounds wrong or odd to you.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.460]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.300]   I get it.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.980]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.860]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.940]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.900]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.820]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.780]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.540]   take care of the supplies.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.380]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.220]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.620]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.620]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.060]   or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.140]   that you got through another week.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.260]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.780]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.580]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.660]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.340]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.900]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.860]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.900]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.740]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.820]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.460]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.940]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.580]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.860]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.860]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.100]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:19.380]   Did you know that electrolyte deficiency or imbalance
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.700]   can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.740]   brain fog, and weakness?
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.540]   Well, our sponsor today, Element,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.100]   helps anyone stay hydrated without the sugar
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.580]   and other dodgy ingredients
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.620]   found in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.980]   I've been enjoying Element for the past year
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.940]   because it's a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.060]   born from the growing body of research
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.580]   revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.100]   occur at sodium levels
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.980]   two to three times government recommendations.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.780]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.260]   to restore health through hydration
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.380]   and even works when you're fasting
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.820]   or on a keto, low-carb, whole food, or paleo diet.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.620]   And while you can always enjoy Element Cold,
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.260]   their new chocolate medley,
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.540]   which includes chocolate mint, chocolate chai,
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.980]   and chocolate raspberry,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.780]   is actually designed to be enjoyed hot.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.740]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.460]   to Navy SEAL teams to everyday parents.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.180]   And if you're not sure it's for you,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.460]   don't worry because Element offers
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.540]   no questions asked refunds
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.260]   so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.140]   And right now, Element is offering
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.900]   a free sample pack with any purchase.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.900]   That's eight single-serving packets
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.140]   free with any Element order.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.940]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.260]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/lmnt.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.780]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.780]   You must go to allthehacks.com/element, L-M-N-T.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.020]   - The next question I wanted to ask
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.580]   was about that sense of urgency.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.620]   And it's something I always struggled with
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.460]   was you put all the responsibility on other people
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.420]   and you have these important deadlines.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.340]   How do you create a sense of urgency
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.260]   within that organization when it's not already there?
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.740]   - Obviously a team of more than one person
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.780]   can come up with more actions and more things
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.140]   and more ideas than you as one single person
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.940]   can keep up with.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.300]   So when you got a team of 100, 150 people,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.580]   100,000 people, you can't keep up.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.420]   You don't want that.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.420]   You want them pushing on you so hard that you can't keep up.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.080]   And it happens by you leaning back,
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.220]   not by leaning in and controlling.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.420]   Like Chris, run more, lose more weight.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.160]   Oh yeah, that, oh shit, thanks.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.640]   Now I got it.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.620]   Does that ever work for anybody?
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.220]   I don't think so.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.180]   It's not about that.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.460]   Like it's gotta come from within.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.220]   You gotta be intrinsically motivated.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.380]   Your team's gotta be intrinsic.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.580]   You tap the intrinsic motivation.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.180]   And then you get all these people
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.780]   that are intrinsically pushing you so hard
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.780]   you can't even keep up.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.580]   When you're feeling that sense of discomfort,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.340]   like imagine like you're sitting in a go-kart
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.700]   and you got like all these people pushing you.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.560]   It's like, ah, you guys are going too fast.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.420]   That's the feeling you want.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.740]   - And so obviously the way to create that feeling
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.020]   is not to tell everyone to drive faster.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.820]   Tactics I've tried in the past
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.100]   are things like making sure everyone understands
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.780]   why we're doing what we're doing.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.520]   Talking about the vision, talking about what purpose we have,
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.140]   what the goals are, what's going on in the environment.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.820]   Are there other things that can build
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.500]   and create that intrinsic motivation?
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.180]   - Sense of agency, a sense of purpose,
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.820]   like you're talking about, 100%.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.300]   Sense of agency and a sense of connectedness.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.260]   So agency is, okay, I get to make decisions.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.140]   I have authority over my life.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.260]   I can control, and my decisions are linked to outcomes.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.260]   I make these decisions, I'm gonna have this kind of,
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.980]   I made those other decisions, make that kind of life.
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.300]   And a sense of connection with other human beings.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.860]   That was one that was hard for me
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.820]   because I tended to be a person who didn't need,
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.000]   I didn't feel like I needed a lot of connection as a human.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.620]   And like have this book,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.140]   "Blue Zones of Happiness" on the shelf behind me.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.420]   So I'm reading about these people who live longer
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.140]   and has big network of community.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.500]   And like, you know, I don't feel that way.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.340]   I'm just perfectly happy doing my own thing.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.280]   But studies show that it's true.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.380]   And there's a sense of connection.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.340]   Now, maybe the way I connect is different
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.620]   than the way someone else connects,
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.020]   but you want the team to connect.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.300]   One way we did that was we outlawed the word they.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.180]   On a submarine, you have a pretty tight team
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.460]   'cause everyone dies or we all live,
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.020]   there's no, it's not like a company
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.460]   where three people can exit
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.500]   and then the rest of the company goes under.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.840]   It's not like that.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.220]   But we had a lot of they's.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.060]   We had rank, we had enlisted guys, we had officers,
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.420]   we had crew, we had engineering.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.760]   So we had they, they, they, they.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.740]   Who made this mistake?
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.540]   It was always they.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.060]   So I got pissed off one day.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.600]   I said, "There's no they on Santa Fe."
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.320]   And it rhymes, so they loved it.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.940]   They remembered it and they believed it.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.180]   So we said, "We ordered the wrong parts."
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.620]   Or, "We didn't set the equipment up correctly."
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.860]   Or, "We misread the signals."
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.420]   Whatever it happened to be.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   And then our brains rewired and it felt like a team.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.060]   The action came first.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.540]   We actuated new thinking.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.180]   So we used the word we.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.820]   When I go into companies, I just listen.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.540]   I say, "Hey, tell me about these guys."
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.260]   "Oh, yeah, we're the marketing team."
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.100]   "What about these guys?"
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.500]   "Oh, they're engineering."
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.020]   Ah-ha, that's the team boundary.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.620]   Not what the org chart says.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.380]   Or, "Who made this decision?"
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.940]   "They did, not we."
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.540]   Very clear.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.260]   So I have fun when I check into hotels sometimes.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.540]   And I'm talking to the person at the front desk.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.100]   And there's something wrong or whatever.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.760]   And they'll say, "They, blah, blah, blah."
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.600]   I was like, "Who's they?"
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.300]   Like, "You have a Marriott jersey on."
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.260]   (laughing)
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.380]   Not me.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.700]   - Is that a simple tactic
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.180]   that companies can experiment with?
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.260]   And I hear the, "I intend to."
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.340]   Obviously, there's some big things.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.420]   Step away, resist the urge to jump in as a leader.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.060]   But little kind of like, I'll call them hacks
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.980]   'cause this is the show.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.740]   It's tell people to tell you what they intend to do.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.340]   To start using we instead of they.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.540]   Are there others like that,
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.540]   that are things that you can quickly implement
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.620]   and see if they have big effects?
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.060]   - For sure.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.980]   Stop asking binary questions.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.740]   So when someone comes to you and says,
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.140]   "I wanna try this," or, "Here's a new idea,"
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.460]   your instinct's gonna be, "Is it safe?
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.620]   "Will it work?
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.700]   "Are you sure?"
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.020]   Those are all binary questions.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.120]   COVID vaccine, is it safe?
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.860]   Stupid question, meaningless question.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.260]   If you say yes or no,
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.940]   it really means you think you're gonna get it or not.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.420]   It doesn't really tell us much about the safety of it.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.540]   How safe is it?
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   So my trick is start the question with the word how.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.900]   How safe is, how sure are you?
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.140]   How likely is this assumption to come true?
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.220]   Now someone can say, "Ah, I'm 99% confident,"
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.260]   or, "I'm 51%, but we should try it anyway."
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.180]   Now you're learning something.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.100]   And it all starts with the word how.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.620]   The second thing is next.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:18.620]   In meetings, pay attention to what we call share of voice.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.740]   Share of voice is if you were to count the number of words
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.020]   each person in the meeting said,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.340]   it would be that word,
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.820]   it would be that histogram of the distribution of words.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.900]   Traditionally, unless you've been thinking about this,
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.180]   the higher-paid people will say more words
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.020]   than the lower-paid people.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.060]   The more skewed that is,
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.340]   the more fragile your decision-making structure is.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.580]   The extreme case, the leader just tells people what to do,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.220]   everyone shuts up and walks out the door.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.620]   So you can imagine how extreme and how fragile that is.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.140]   So you got six people, you're in a decision meeting,
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.980]   share of voice should be about a sixth per person,
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.140]   because then you're hearing what everyone sees,
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.420]   you know what everyone knows, and the group benefits.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.300]   And science shows that those are more resilient
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.940]   and adaptive teams.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.300]   So if you're leading the meeting,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.460]   the point of leading the meeting
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.940]   is not to get your quote point across.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.900]   That's just coercion.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.700]   And with the hope of compliance,
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.020]   the point of leading a meeting
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.300]   is to pay attention to the structure of the meeting
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.700]   so that you can even the share of voice,
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.500]   which means if someone's talking too much,
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.100]   you gotta control them.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.780]   And if someone's not speaking,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.420]   well, you have to make it safer than speak up.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.260]   - And how do you do that?
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.980]   I think it's easier to know how to tell someone,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.420]   "Hey, you've said a lot."
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.140]   - Chris, I think we know what you, yeah.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.980]   Well, first of all,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.020]   you gotta understand the structure of the meeting.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.740]   Most meetings are run, discuss, then vote.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.260]   "Hey, we have to make a decision.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.820]   Are we gonna put our new plant in Seattle or North Carolina?"
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.660]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.620]   Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.940]   Okay, so what's everyone think?
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.180]   And then it's this binary vote,
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.700]   Seattle versus North Carolina.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.260]   So the problem with that is because the discussion
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.860]   is a series discussion,
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.980]   the initial, the very first people to speak
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.420]   have an overweighted importance in the discussion
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.100]   in terms of anchoring the group,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.900]   which makes the people who think differently than them
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.020]   less and less likely to contribute.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.940]   So what you wanna do is vote first, then discuss.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.220]   So we would say, "Okay, let's take a vote on this."
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.340]   We could use cards.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.980]   We could use our hands.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.180]   We say, "Okay, five."
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.460]   Here, let's use our hands.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.620]   Five fingers means I'm 100%, or 99%.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.860]   We don't like to say 100%
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.780]   because that assumes an arrogance for the future
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.460]   that it's unfounded.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.420]   But I'm 99% sure Seattle's the right place.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.380]   Zero means I'm 99% sure Raleigh's the right place,
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.340]   or any number in between.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.180]   Two or three means you basically don't know or don't care.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.300]   Ready, one, two, three, pop up your hands.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.220]   Now I'm looking for the fives and the zeros.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.020]   I'm looking for the extremes.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.100]   And then we say, "Okay, let's hear from..."
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.220]   And I got a whole bunch of fives, but not too many zeros.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.980]   So now I say, "Okay, great. Let's hear from zeros.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.500]   Let's hear from the people who voted zero."
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.740]   Not the zeros, but the people who voted zero.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.340]   Why? The fives are gonna wanna talk.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.380]   The fives, there's a majority of them.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.060]   But we already know, like if that's the majority opinion,
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.540]   we already know the majority opinion.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.940]   We don't need to spend more time on it.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.260]   And the more we talk about the majority opinion,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   harder it is for the minority opinion
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.100]   to say what they really think.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.620]   They may say, "Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.860]   I was thinking something different."
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.020]   But that's the kind of thing you wanna do.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.340]   Vote first, then discuss,
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.340]   and then spotlight the dissenting and outlying opinions
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.220]   by letting those people speak.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.420]   - It's always hard to get people to speak up.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.340]   Are there tactics?
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.140]   If you notice the person who's a zero is like,
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.180]   "Well, you know, I just don't like..."
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.660]   Like, is there encouraging things?
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.780]   Is it best done offline?
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.060]   Have you tried doing it asynchronously
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.260]   with written communication for those who don't love talking?
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.100]   - Yeah, that's all good stuff.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.540]   One of the things...
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.580]   So it's always about safety.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.620]   People are speaking up 'cause it doesn't feel safe
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.460]   to speak up.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.980]   So choice and small makes it safe.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.340]   The other thing that makes it safe
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.700]   is the level of cognitive involvement.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.060]   Description, assessment, action.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.260]   It goes in that order.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.660]   So description is the safest thing.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.020]   If I just said, "Tell me about the Riverside platform
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.500]   "that we're using to make this show," it's fine.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.860]   You're just like, "Well, here it is,
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.900]   "it doesn't cost this much," whatever.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.380]   Then I say, "Give me an assessment."
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.340]   Like on a scale of one to nine, how effective is it?
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.420]   Okay, now...
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.940]   But now it requires more vulnerability.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.260]   And then finally if I say, "Take action,"
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.340]   well, what platform should we use for our podcast show?
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.100]   Ooh, now I can be wrong.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.340]   So we always invite people along this...
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.260]   There's two sequences you wanna follow.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.380]   Number one is description, assessment, action
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.500]   'cause it moves from safe to vulnerable.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.460]   The second one is we call it one, some, all.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.340]   So imagine you have a group of people, five groups of...
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.220]   You have 25 people, five tables of five.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.420]   If you just said to the group,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.060]   "Hey, what does everyone think about this?"
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.680]   Raise your hand.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.820]   You might not get any hands.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.820]   So what you say is, "Everyone, write down on a card
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.340]   "three things about ABC, this."
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.220]   Let's go back to the, "Where's the new plant gonna be?"
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.900]   Write down which of the two places
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.380]   you want the plant to go in three reasons.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.980]   And one reason why it might be a bad idea.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.820]   You have two minutes.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.340]   And so that's the one.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.660]   It's safe, right?
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.100]   It's me, it's my card.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.420]   Like, why wouldn't I write anything down?
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.220]   So people write things down.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.240]   And they say, "Okay, now at your table,
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.380]   "share what's on your card."
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.740]   Now, the key there is don't share what...
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.020]   You could say, "Well, share what you think."
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.500]   That would be what you might say.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.980]   But you say, "Share what's on your card,"
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.220]   'cause now you've sort of distanced it from you.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.080]   "Oh, I'm just reading what's on my card."
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.960]   Yeah, of course it is like what you think,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.740]   but just even these little things help a little bit.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.660]   Okay, just share what's on your card.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.380]   And then as a table, you could give 'em another thing.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.180]   Okay, come up with the top five and bottom,
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.940]   whatever, something like that.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.100]   And you give 'em more time.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.280]   So if you gave 'em two minutes by themselves,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.100]   you might give 'em five minutes at a table.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.540]   You say, "Okay, now, who would like to share?"
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.340]   Or which table has something
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.000]   that they'd like to share with the group?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.220]   Now you get a bunch of hands popped right off the bat.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.540]   So it's one, some, S-O-M-E, some, all,
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.920]   is the progression,
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.360]   and then it's description, assessment, action.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.180]   The other way to think about it is description is pause,
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.780]   like VCR buttons, pause.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.020]   I'm just, here's what it is, here's what I see.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.220]   Assessment, that's rewind.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.180]   Where does it come from?
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.660]   That feels more, that pause is the most certain thing.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.980]   I feel most certain about it
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.100]   'cause I'm just looking at it, it's right here.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.300]   And then, well, how'd this happen?
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.340]   Like, where'd this happen?
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.020]   It's from the past, so it's knowable,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.860]   but I might not have seen everything,
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.340]   but it feels relatively knowable.
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.780]   Then finally we go to the future.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.420]   So it's pause, rewind, future, pause, rewind, future.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.460]   And then when we trained our team,
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.500]   so the sailors would call me,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.940]   the officers would call me in the middle of the night,
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.500]   three in the morning, we have a situation,
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.780]   the tanker's bearing down on us, whatever it happens to be.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.400]   They always reported these things in this exact sequence,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.940]   which was description, assessment, action.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.820]   Captain, we're at this location, we're on this course,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.140]   we're heading North at five knots, 400 feet.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.980]   We have a sonar contact, assessment,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.820]   I think it's a tanker coming straight at us,
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.960]   action, I intend to turn right and go deeper,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.980]   something like that.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.620]   Always in the exact same sequence.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.220]   And sometimes they wouldn't get the whole way.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.020]   They would say, assessment, description, assessment,
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.620]   I don't, and then action, I have no idea what to do.
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.120]   Come to the control room.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.860]   But it's okay, because I move through,
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.620]   but if I started with what do you wanna do about it,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.320]   I'd get nothing.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.220]   (air whooshing)
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.940]   - How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.700]   Research shows that if you're like 90% of Americans,
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.780]   you most likely have money anxiety.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.500]   In fact, that is one of the reasons
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.740]   I started a financial planning firm back in 2016.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.240]   And when we shut the company down,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.940]   we did extensive research on the financial service company
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.900]   we wanted to recommend to our clients,
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.540]   and we landed on Facet,
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.420]   and I'm excited they're sponsoring today's episode.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.740]   Facet has turned the financial planning industry
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.460]   on its head, making financial planning accessible
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.060]   to everyone, not just the most wealthy.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.140]   And one of the things I hated about this industry
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.460]   is that so many financial advisors charge
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.740]   based on a high percentage of your assets, but not Facet.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.940]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee,
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.820]   which means you actually keep more of what you invest.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.980]   And they match you with your own CFP professional
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.980]   who uses industry-leading technology
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.820]   and is backed by a team of experts
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.340]   across investments, taxes, and more.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.580]   So, tackle the uncertainty you're feeling
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.660]   about your finances and replace it
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.860]   with some real confidence about your money.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.500]   Go to allthehacks.com/facet, that's F-A-C-E-T.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.380]   I made sure to let them know you're on your way,
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.180]   and they'll even waive the $250 enrollment fee
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.220]   for all of you.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:48.020]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet, F-A-C-E-T.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.060]   Don't leave your finances up to chance.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.540]   Facet Wealth is an SEC-registered investment advisor.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.740]   This is not an offer to buy or sell securities,
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.900]   nor is it investment, legal, or tax advice.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.580]   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.340]   Terms and conditions may apply.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.700]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact,
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.060]   and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.540]   to your new year routine.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.020]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.300]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.020]   for over a year that sources the best coffee
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.780]   across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.620]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.260]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.060]   from the comfort of your own home
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.220]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.180]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.500]   Sign up for a subscription
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.140]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.260]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.500]   just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.740]   And over the past year,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.540]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.980]   But this last bag of beans
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.660]   from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.860]   it's called Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.740]   So jumpstart this year by signing up
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.020]   for a Trade subscription.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.300]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.140]   with select subscription plans
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.780]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.500]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.220]   for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.740]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.420]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.900]   and supporting the show.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.740]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.460]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.220]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.780]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.020]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.380]   You're going back to your submarine example.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.620]   So I feel like I wanna ask something
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.100]   that I think I've mentioned in the intro,
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.940]   but you started this whole project with the Santa Fe
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.420]   with a pretty low team morale and low performance.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.100]   And you took over this whole new model
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.180]   of control and communication.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.860]   And can you just share a little bit about
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.420]   the impact and the result that happened during your tenure?
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.380]   - Yeah, I had less stress in my life.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:01.620]   Now, we set records for performance.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.340]   We set records for morale.
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.220]   100% of our sailors signed up to stay in the Navy,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.300]   which is a record.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.100]   Can't go higher than that.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.020]   And over the next 10 years,
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.300]   more officers on the Santa Fe became submarine commanders
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.180]   than any other submarine anyone has ever heard of.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.180]   10 from just that one group over that three-year period.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:27.180]   But the key is I was always, as a leader,
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:32.220]   so exhausted and nervous about being wrong.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.900]   I don't know how some of these command and control leaders
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.740]   do it.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.580]   They run around telling people what to do.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.540]   It's like, "Aren't you afraid you're gonna be wrong?"
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.300]   I was like, "What am I missing?"
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.620]   And if I was wrong, people would die
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.100]   and companies go out of business
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.260]   and we pollute the environment, whatever it happens to be.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.580]   And now I had this rich network,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.420]   this sort of spider web safety net
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.700]   of people telling me what they thought all the time.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.540]   And we weren't always perfect and we weren't always right,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.740]   but I just had so much less stress.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.420]   I always had felt like I'm always putting energy
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.100]   into the system as the leader.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.500]   I'm running around, making it happen.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.860]   I'm exhausted.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.340]   I'm checking on people.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.900]   I always should see more.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.740]   I know more.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.580]   I could do it better.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.580]   I could do it faster.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.940]   It was exhausting.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.020]   And it all flipped on its head.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.020]   And it felt like the energy was coming to me all day long.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.860]   At the end of the day,
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.140]   I had more energy than when I started.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   And I stopped going to all these silly meetings
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.900]   that were just theater.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.860]   We didn't need them.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.100]   We had meetings, but they were real.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.900]   And it was great.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.740]   - Just to touch on the meetings,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.420]   do you have any kind of rules
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.380]   for how to get rid of the silly meetings
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.860]   or identify which ones are a waste of time?
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.460]   Because I think most of the people listening here
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.860]   would probably tell you that a good portion of their day
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.420]   is spent in meetings that seem like a waste.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.700]   So I guess the follow-up then
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.860]   is how do you convince people that?
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.140]   - I never convince anyone of anything.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.900]   They already know it.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.220]   And we help people do the stuff
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.580]   they already believe in doing.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.140]   But I'm pretty sure most people
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.500]   wouldn't need a lot of convincing to say,
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.700]   can we do away with fewer meetings?
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.140]   Like I think vote first.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.180]   So they think, oh, this is gonna take longer
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.740]   'cause I have to hear all these different opinions.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.980]   No, it actually is faster
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.980]   because you get to the actual issues way quicker.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:34.740]   And then the other thing is decisions aren't unilateral
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.180]   and they're not forever.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.740]   So we always say, okay, a decision on this,
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.900]   again, for some reason, this is the submarine decisions.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.940]   We work with all kinds of businesses now,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.740]   but let's say we're in a submarine again
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.820]   and we're arguing about turning North or South.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.300]   We could argue about that all day long
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.620]   or we could just pick, let's go North and see how it works.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.300]   But knowing that we can turn around and go back South
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.700]   and it's not irreversible.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.780]   Now we lost the time that we went North.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:04.820]   We could have been going South,
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   but we always keep a little bit in the back of our mind
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.220]   that we're gonna revisit this decision
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.780]   to put an expiration date on the decision like cheese.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.700]   We're gonna revisit it.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.700]   And that relieves, it minimizes the barriers
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:25.900]   to transitioning from the decision to the action.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.900]   You wanna minimize the barriers from decision to action
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.660]   and you wanna minimize the barriers
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.220]   from action back to decision
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.620]   because that will create an agility in your business
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.060]   where you say, think about it all in,
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.460]   work, work, work, work, work, wait a minute, timeout, out.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.100]   Think broad perspective and then commit in.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.940]   And you wanna have super focus.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.140]   You don't wanna have, oh, we're in sort of
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.820]   with just two toes and half my brain is thinking about,
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.100]   is this really the right thing to do?
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.300]   That's not what you want.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.180]   - And I love the approach of realizing
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.980]   that a reversible decision should be made faster.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.620]   I remember so many decisions we debated
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.900]   in the early days of my company where we were like,
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.140]   what microwave should we buy in the office?
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.500]   It was like, we should just literally
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.860]   just bought the first microwave.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.220]   Like, you know, you have these decisions
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.780]   that feel like you could get stuck in analysis paralysis
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.020]   and this constant reminder for me actually
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.420]   was like a sticky note on my computer
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.140]   was just like, is this reversible?
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.260]   And if this is an easy reversible decision
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.380]   and it's low impact on the business, just make it.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.220]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.060]   And then the other one,
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.420]   I haven't always adhered to vote first.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.180]   - Buy two microwaves, who cares?
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.620]   - And I haven't always adhered to vote first,
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.700]   but sometimes I've done kind of vote in the middle,
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.900]   which is you're in the middle of a discussion,
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:41.980]   you didn't vote at first,
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.820]   you haven't listened to this episode yet.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.380]   And you realize like, maybe we're all just on the same page
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.260]   and we've done a, hey, quick pause here.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.260]   Does anyone, and obviously if it needs to be a small group
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.380]   where people feel comfortable speaking up,
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.700]   but if it's, is anyone opposed to just doing this thing?
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.940]   And I can't tell you the number of meetings I've been in
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.860]   where people were just going around the room
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.140]   discussing something that we all agreed on.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.140]   And I think one of the other advantages of voting first,
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.220]   aside from just getting out opinions that you might not know
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.820]   is that you might all agree
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.220]   and you could have just wasted 45 minutes on a meeting
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.220]   talking about why everyone thinks we should do something
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.980]   that we all agree on and we can just do it.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.020]   And you can end the meeting in two minutes.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.260]   So that's another one that,
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.860]   another benefit that I found of voting first.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.220]   - If everyone agrees, I would be still a little worried.
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.620]   I would say, okay, great.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.260]   It's like that scene in World War Z
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.100]   where like they have like the 13th person
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.940]   has to disagree deal.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.220]   It's like, okay, now let's make up five reasons
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.620]   why this is not a good.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.900]   We're still, okay, we're going to do it,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.500]   but let's just come up with five reasons
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.100]   why this would go bad.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.140]   Imagine we're sitting here in six months
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.860]   and this has been a giant shit show.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.460]   What, like what would be the top five reasons?
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.220]   And just game through that a little bit, maybe if you want.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.460]   But yeah, you save a lot of time.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.660]   - Bill Marris, who used to run Google Ventures
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.740]   where I worked,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.220]   if ever the entire team voted yes on an investment
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.540]   and we moved to blind voting
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.580]   so that we didn't have kind of groups involved,
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.860]   we actually built a piece of software
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.420]   where you could vote on deals and add feedback.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.260]   And he wouldn't tell people the results of the vote.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.260]   He would just come in and disagree vehemently
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.140]   if everyone, and you'd all be,
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.660]   take the counter perspective.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.140]   And he felt like his role as a leader
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.980]   was to take the counter if everyone was supportive.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.900]   - Yeah, yeah, I think at least to discuss it.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.700]   And then, okay, okay, great.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.620]   We're going to make the investment,
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.300]   but you want to explore that.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.980]   Like if this is such a no brainer,
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.020]   why didn't someone else,
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.580]   why hasn't someone else already bought the company?
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.620]   It should be for sale.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.020]   - So without even mentioning it,
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.900]   we moved from the story you first wrote in your first book
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.060]   about your experience on the Santa Fe
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.380]   to your most recent book,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:54.580]   where you talk about six leadership plays
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.620]   that you've used revolving around the language
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.020]   of how you operate.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.260]   But what, after writing a best-selling book
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.980]   about leadership, led you to feel the need
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.140]   to write another book on leadership?
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.540]   - I don't know about other writers,
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.020]   but all my stuff starts with self-help.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.900]   I just felt, even at the end of the experience
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.500]   on the submarine, the very next day,
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.820]   the next year, five years later,
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.060]   and now I was running my company
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.500]   and we were interacting with these companies
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.580]   around the world, helping them change their cultures.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.620]   But it all started with me.
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.620]   I kept feeling like my language was programmed
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.900]   by some other, some evil thing in my head
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.140]   that made me say, right, does that make sense?
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:39.980]   We good?
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.100]   Like these kinds of things,
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.500]   phrases that I actually didn't want to say,
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.460]   but I was still saying them.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.740]   And so I was trying to analyze the structure
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.700]   and the patterns in the language
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.380]   and why they held so much sway over me
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.260]   and why they were so powerful.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.700]   And what I wanted to say instead,
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.620]   we say we act our way to new thinking,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.260]   but if you don't see the words that you can say,
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.020]   so if you don't realize that you could say,
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.860]   how sure are you, as opposed to, are you sure?
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.580]   Then you're just gonna keep asking, are you sure?
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:22.420]   If you don't realize that you could ask
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.100]   something simple, like just tell me more,
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.700]   as opposed to, well, let me explain,
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.700]   then you won't do that.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.180]   And so I feel like basically it's just a whole book
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.660]   of don't say this, say that.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.460]   It's a bunch of book of sentence starters,
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.380]   which is how it started.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.940]   But it turns out there's a very interesting structure
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.660]   behind why the language is the way we use it,
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.140]   is the way we say now and what we've inherited,
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.420]   what we're programmed to say.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.540]   And I think there's a coherent structure
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:56.180]   in the solar system as we knew it,
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.260]   where the sun revolved around the earth
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.660]   and the solar system as we wanted,
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.740]   where the earth revolves around the sun.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.980]   - I don't wanna jump into all six leadership plays
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.060]   because you wrote a book and anyone listening
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.420]   can go read this book and I've done it and I encourage you,
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.100]   but there's a couple I wanted to hit on.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.460]   So one is that my wife loves baking
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.020]   and I unfortunately also love baked goods,
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.140]   which is a terrible combination.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.540]   - We call that enabling behavior.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.580]   - I know, and my recommendation is always,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.220]   hey, why don't you just not bake?
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.700]   And she's like, no, why don't you learn
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.620]   to not eat all the cookies in one sitting?
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.100]   - Just 'cause I bake it doesn't mean you have to eat it.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.820]   - Yeah, I've heard that countless times.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.220]   And in 2021, I had bouts where I said, you know what?
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.980]   I'm just not allowed to eat the cookies.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.740]   And this year, thanks to reading your book,
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.780]   I've decided I am not the kind of person
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.820]   that overindulges on baked goods.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.540]   And I haven't put that to the test,
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.300]   we're only a few days into the year,
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.780]   but can you talk about why that distinction is so important
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.860]   and why commitment can actually be more effective
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.500]   than compliance?
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.900]   - Yeah, this came from work where we looked at
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.620]   the language of teams that were fragile and made mistakes
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.580]   versus the ones that were more resilient
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.300]   and it's called leadership is language.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.580]   So here's a simple example.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.780]   You could say, you have the self-talk
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.060]   about this baked good thing.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.900]   You could say, I can't eat baked goods.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.060]   You're sitting there, the baked goods
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.980]   are sitting on the table,
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.140]   you've already had a slice of bread,
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.380]   you don't wanna eat more.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:28.300]   Oh, I can't eat that versus I don't eat that.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.300]   And you want to say, I don't eat baked goods.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.540]   For me, I don't think it's binary.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.180]   It's not like you're never gonna eat a baked good,
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.620]   but I don't eat a lot.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.980]   So it's just a subliminal thing.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.060]   The reason why I don't eat it,
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.660]   studies show when people say, I don't do something,
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.500]   they have a higher rate of sticking with their commitment
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.700]   than when they say, I can't.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.540]   Why?
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.380]   Because when I say, I can't,
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.620]   it's this outside force is imposing on me
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.220]   that you can't, you shouldn't do it, you can't do it
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.180]   versus when you say, you don't do it,
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.900]   you're tapping into your intrinsic,
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.460]   you're giving yourself agency over your life.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.260]   You're tapping into your own intrinsic desire
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.900]   to control your life and say,
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.580]   I don't eat, I don't go to those kinds of meetings.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.780]   I don't eat baked, I don't eat that or that kind of thing.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.300]   Now, no one can argue with you.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.860]   If I go to my mom and I said, mom, oh, I can't eat.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.660]   Oh, no, you look fine, just a little bit.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.220]   She's arguing with me.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.460]   When I say, no, I don't eat that, there's nothing to say.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.300]   Okay.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:36.820]   So you want to use language as much as possible
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.460]   that makes you powerful as opposed to powerless.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.980]   And that's why you want to say to yourself,
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.140]   I don't do whatever it is that you're trying not to do
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.220]   as opposed to I can't do it.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.820]   - I'm just now realizing how much more effective don't is
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.020]   in like a peer pressure situation of,
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.020]   gosh, I just, I can't have another drink tonight.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:57.980]   I've been drinking this week.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.380]   And it's like, your friends are like, nah, nah, you can.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.420]   And then if you have a friend who doesn't drink,
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.820]   they're at the table, they're like, I don't drink.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.140]   And no one's pushing them.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.660]   They're just sitting there totally fine with whatever.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.500]   - Yeah, imagine that.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.540]   Like the person, when you, that's what they say.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.380]   They don't say, oh, I can't drink.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.180]   They say, I don't drink.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.500]   And that's like, boom, shut down.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.860]   Great, I respect that, you have a coke.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.260]   Exactly.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.780]   I don't drink more or whatever it is.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.860]   I don't drink after 11.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.580]   I don't drink after two drinks, I don't drink.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.540]   Or I don't drink, like I don't drink and drive,
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.620]   not I can't drink and drive.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.180]   'Cause obviously you could drink and drive, but.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.940]   - I've had situations where I'm like, you know what?
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.020]   I just don't want to drink tonight.
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.260]   And instead of just being more, you know,
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.300]   a sort of having, saying I don't do that,
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.020]   I would just drive intentionally.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.140]   So I could say, oh, I drove here.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.580]   I can't, you know, like, I don't drink and drive.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.900]   That was my like out, was if I just drove,
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.940]   then I could absolve myself of any peer pressure.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.140]   - Because it's socially, that's okay.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.980]   Like, oh, well, you have an excuse not to drink.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.020]   So we all respect, we understand, respect that
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.340]   versus I'm not drinking tonight
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.340]   or whatever it happens to be.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.940]   How does this kind of play in the role
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.780]   of work and organizations?
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.900]   - So much of the language we use
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:12.780]   has subtle markers of the industrial age structure
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:17.580]   where leaders made decisions and got the team to do it.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:21.180]   In the industrial age, you want people to comply
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.420]   and keep moving forward.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.940]   We want the assembly line to run as long as possible
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:31.500]   because any stoppages are lost output.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.820]   When Ford was building the Model T,
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:37.180]   the assembly line essentially ran,
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.860]   it ran for almost 15 years into the 20s,
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.780]   by which time the country had changed.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.260]   There was a lot more wealth and it was an old, tired thing.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.060]   And then they had to shut down for like three months.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.940]   And GM at this point was building flashier cars,
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.780]   which were in vogue.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.620]   And then GM, GM should have never caught up.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.340]   They should have never, they should never be in business
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.540]   if Ford had done it right.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.820]   But it was because of this opening.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.060]   And so now it's been neck and neck ever since.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:11.060]   So one of the things I hear a lot are people say things,
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.220]   they say some version of, does that make sense?
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.180]   Are we good?
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.340]   We're all good here?
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.460]   Everyone happy?
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.740]   Something like that.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:24.660]   And we say it more times than we even realize
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.460]   we were saying it.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.980]   I say it.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.380]   And then you say, well, why did we say that?
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.660]   Why did I say, oh, so we're going to turn north, right?
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.340]   We all look good to launch the product, okay?
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.340]   So the product launch will happen
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.020]   as scheduled next Wednesday.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.620]   Everybody happy?
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:45.340]   It's because it's a vestige of this coercion and compliance.
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.980]   It's just makes it a little bit harder for someone to say,
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.100]   no, I'm not happy.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.540]   And to get compliance from the team
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.740]   as opposed to what I'm trying,
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.860]   what I try to say is, how could this be wrong?
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.420]   Hey, next month we have this scheduled launch
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.500]   of this product.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.780]   This is kind of what I wish Boeing had done.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.020]   Hey, how could this go wrong?
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.780]   How are we feeling about the project
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.620]   as opposed to this inevitability towards making it happen?
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.460]   And this little,
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.700]   so you want to listen to those little language markers
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.700]   for you and remove them and actually go the opposite.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:26.420]   Every time your instinct is to say, is that wrong?
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.140]   No, or how could that be wrong?
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.220]   Ask it in a neutral way,
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.900]   which invites the other opinion
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:38.100]   because it's socially, it's already hard to disagree,
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.940]   to be the person who disagrees with the group or the boss.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.540]   That's hard.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.900]   So rather than making that harder,
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.660]   let me make that easier.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.060]   - I also want to talk about one of the other leadership plays
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.700]   about taking time to pause and reflect
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.780]   and fixing that into a project.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.940]   And you talk about it in saying complete, not just continue.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.300]   Why is this important?
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.660]   And how do you determine
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.540]   when to schedule those kind of completions?
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:08.540]   - If we never complete, then you never celebrate.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:12.860]   If you never celebrate, you never reinforce fun
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.780]   and the reasons why we do things.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.140]   And it just becomes, in the Navy we say SSDD,
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.780]   which means same stuff, different day.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.140]   And everything just runs into the next day.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.460]   The problem with that is we're trying to do
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.380]   two different things with our brains.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.300]   One is we're trying to be focused on tasks.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.780]   I'm coding, I'm swimming,
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.780]   I'm bringing a SEAL team onto the submarine.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.500]   It requires focus.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:49.420]   It requires excluding distractors.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.740]   The other thing we're trying to do with our brain
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.220]   is to make decisions.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.100]   How should we bring the SEAL team on the submarine?
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.140]   How are we gonna do that?
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.820]   And what did we learn from the last time we did it?
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.780]   We've complete this period of activity
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.220]   and then we want to pause and reflect.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.820]   This requires an expansive view.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.780]   It requires raising our head up, looking left and right,
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.300]   broadening our perspective, bringing in those things
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.260]   which otherwise we would find both distraction.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:19.940]   In short, it's about avoiding variability
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.460]   and being allergic to variability
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.220]   when we want to be focused on tasks.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.940]   And then it's about embracing variability
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.260]   when we're in the thinking space.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:33.260]   If you don't make it clear, are we in one side or the other,
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.820]   then you're always in the middle
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.140]   and you're neither optimized for focused work
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.380]   and you're not optimized for thinking work.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.860]   And you get like muddled thinking and half committed action.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:49.700]   So what we think is really important to make it clear,
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.220]   okay, we're thinking, we're broadening our perspective
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.100]   and you have to release the pressure of the clock
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.140]   because it's that time pressure that shrinks our perspective
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.260]   and our prefrontal cortex ability
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.300]   to take in all these inputs
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.060]   and we just see what's in front of us.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.660]   And we've all done these activities
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.620]   where like the gorilla walks across the basketball court
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.460]   and you don't even see it
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.740]   because you're counting the number of balls,
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.260]   those kinds of things.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.740]   So we have to release the pressure of the time.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.740]   The leader is the person who has to do that.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.660]   The team is going to want to commit
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.460]   is they're going to want to persist in their actions
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.900]   'cause that's what they're paid to do and deliver something.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.260]   The leader is going to say timeout,
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.220]   everyone put your pencils down.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.500]   I want to make sure we're on track, see how everyone's doing.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.940]   How do we think about what we've done,
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.620]   what we want to make decisions about the future.
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.500]   Now, you can do that.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.700]   You can just call an audible on that,
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.340]   but we think it's probably better to schedule those.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.340]   Agile, for example, Agile software development
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.180]   kind of has this baked in with these sprint cycles.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.940]   And then allows you, also you can celebrate,
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.700]   pause, reflect what you've done, you celebrate,
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.700]   make commitments about the future and move on.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.700]   - And are there situations where,
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.700]   or I guess what is the downside of not doing this?
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.060]   Are there companies or projects
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.700]   that never took the time to pause and complete
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.820]   and just kept continuing
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.540]   that kind of probably regret it based on the outcomes?
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.380]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.020]   Kodak kept making print film.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.460]   Blockbuster kept running DVDs.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.820]   As opposed to like, there's a story Andy Grove tells
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:27.820]   in "Only the Paranoid Survived" during the Intel.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.980]   This is after he and Gordon Moore,
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.660]   they'd founded this company.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:35.140]   It was going very, very well.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.660]   They were rich and they were making storage,
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.700]   basically memory storage.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.540]   And memory storage at this point was becoming a commodity
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.860]   because the Japanese and Koreans were getting into it.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.820]   And it was just becoming a commoditized product.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.700]   And they ran an experiment.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:56.020]   They said, imagine we got fired
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:00.940]   and a new team CEO, president was brought in.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.180]   The decision they needed to make
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:07.180]   was do a shift out of storage and go to microprocessors.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.380]   What would they do?
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.060]   And they said, well, that'd be easy.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.900]   We'd get out of storage and go to microprocessors.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.900]   But storage is why they were rich, why they were successful,
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.820]   why Intel was the company it was.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.020]   But because they had made the decision,
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.460]   their psyches were connected to those decisions
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.060]   and they had to distance themselves.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.940]   And they did it through this thought experiment,
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.620]   which was genius.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.900]   And they say, well, that's obvious.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.500]   And then so that's when they made the shift
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.540]   and they came out with the 8088, the processors.
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.660]   And that's the Intel you know today.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.980]   - Yeah, and is it possible to
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:45.460]   make those completions too frequent?
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.540]   - Oh yeah, we can overdrive the process.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.500]   So for example, if I say, hey, let's run an experiment.
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:54.060]   So for example, so here's what happened to my company.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.580]   Okay, we're gonna redesign the website, for example.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:01.860]   And then we're gonna, so make a commitment.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:04.500]   New design, we're gonna watch it for two months,
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.180]   take data, blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.100]   We're gonna make another redesign.
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.540]   Redesign the website, we launch it.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.100]   Now we're in the data, two weeks goes by.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.980]   I go to an event, a conference, I give a speech,
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.020]   but there's other speakers there.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.620]   And so I'm sitting in the room
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.180]   and there's one guy's talking about website design.
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.860]   And I have all these ideas, I write down, blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.980]   I go back, now it's only been two weeks,
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.060]   but I have all these ideas.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.540]   And I start telling him, no, no, we need to do this.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.340]   I can see, oh no, we may gotta make this happen.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.540]   I'm, oh, it's overdriving the process.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.940]   So on the one hand, we wanna inject,
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.500]   deliberately inject points for changing course.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.100]   But on the other hand, we also deliberately protect
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.460]   against changing course
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.420]   while we're in the decision-making process.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.140]   And I'm not gonna say never do it.
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:56.420]   Like it might be time to change.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.100]   Like just don't look up.
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.460]   All of a sudden there's a comment coming to hit the earth.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.060]   Yeah, maybe we should reevaluate.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.700]   Like let's not wait for the next two weeks.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.340]   But I call that the good idea, Ferry.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:12.340]   So A, you protect the team from being whipsawing
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.500]   'cause then you never stabilize the experiment.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.580]   I'm a little bit allergic to the phrase
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.820]   continuous improvement because it implies
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.780]   I'm just continually tweaking the process,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.460]   which I don't think is the right way to do it.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.820]   I think you wanna do some batch tweaks
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.460]   and then measure performance
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.060]   and then batch tweaks and measure performance.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:38.060]   And so it's continue us or it's incremental in that way
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.700]   and it doesn't ever end.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.060]   So in that sense, it's continuous or continual,
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.540]   but we're not always tweaking things.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.380]   - The last leadership play I wanna touch on,
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.060]   and there are a few we didn't hit
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.460]   that you all should check out,
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.180]   was all about connecting with the team.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.540]   And it reminded me a bit of the book "Radical Candor."
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.020]   And I just wanna know what role you think emotions have
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.420]   in decision-making and leadership.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.340]   - All decisions are emotional.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.860]   If we didn't have emotion,
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.140]   we would be unable to make a decision.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.700]   We wouldn't make a decision.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.660]   We would do things, they might look like decisions,
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.060]   but they're not decisions.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.020]   So if I'm looking at an ant and it runs three inches
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.140]   that way and turns left and runs four inches that way,
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.820]   it didn't decide to do that.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:31.180]   It just did it through its innate programming.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.140]   When people have suffered brain damage,
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:40.140]   which removes their ability to have, feel emotions,
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:44.820]   it's linked with an inability to make decisions.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.340]   And there's, I tell a story about a patient
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.740]   that Dr. Demasio, who's a neurosurgeon,
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.260]   had where they did, and this is exactly what happened.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.220]   We know that all decision-making,
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.940]   basically the wiring for your decision-making calculus
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.500]   in your brain passes through an emotional part of your brain.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.980]   That's why we move from description to assessment
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.980]   than action, because action involves decision-making.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.500]   Let's say I'm trying to buy a new house.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.660]   One of the things that my wife and I like to do
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.420]   is watch these house-hunting shows,
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.180]   and we try and guess which house they're gonna buy.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.660]   I spend more time than you, than I. (laughs)
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.300]   I've watched a lot of these.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.700]   Never once does someone say, "Well, I've run the numbers,
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.700]   "and this house is this square footage,
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.940]   "and this, and this, and this, and this."
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.820]   So it's the right house to buy.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.700]   Okay, let's get it.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   It's never like that.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.980]   I have 100% prediction ability,
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.660]   'cause I ignore whatever the man says,
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.180]   and this irritates my wife.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.460]   But it's always whatever the woman says,
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.300]   that's what they're gonna get.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.020]   And it's always something like, "Hey, I can see our family."
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.700]   It's an emotional thing.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.460]   So all decisions at the end of the day,
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.340]   because they involve the future, are emotional.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.900]   And yeah, you want data.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.740]   And so if we don't have
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.740]   a healthy emotional environment at work,
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.340]   we can't make healthy decisions.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.180]   And if we don't have an emotional environment at work
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.340]   for 80% of the people who work there,
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.820]   then 80% of the people are not gonna contribute
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.740]   to the decision-making ability of the organization.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.940]   And I like to ask leaders,
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.460]   "What did it cost for you to make this decision?"
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.740]   Like I held up, "What do you make?"
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.660]   I make pens, like the one I'm holding in my hand.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.260]   "What did it cost for this, this, this, this?"
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.180]   "Oh, I can tell you, it's at a 0.01 penny."
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.460]   "Well, what did it cost for you to make the decision
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.140]   that you're gonna make the spend?"
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:34.980]   "No idea."
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.580]   "That you're gonna market in the following ways?"
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.420]   "No idea."
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.140]   "That you're selling it on Amazon, but not on whatever."
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.220]   No, we don't know to orders of magnitude
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.500]   what it costs to make decisions in our company,
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.460]   but it's a product, it's an output we should know.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.260]   And once you start thinking about it,
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.980]   you're like, "Well, higher the decision is made
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.500]   in the company, that more it cost me,
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.580]   'cause I'm paying a senior vice president
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.180]   who makes 500 grand to make a decision,
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.580]   whereas the guy across the street is paying
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.060]   the floor manager who makes 120 grand
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.740]   to make that decision, they're gonna win."
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:11.540]   So think about the cost of your decisions,
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.540]   get them as low as possible.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.580]   - All right, so I feel like everything else,
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.300]   definitely check out the book.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.540]   But I do wanna say, if someone's listening
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.420]   and they're not in the leadership role
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.900]   to make a lot of these changes themselves,
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.260]   what can they do to help push an organization
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.100]   towards a more healthy set of languages
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.860]   and more productive team?
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.740]   - The cool thing is this all, you can just,
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:34.900]   you just start doing stuff.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.740]   You just stop asking people, "Are you sure?"
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.940]   You just start asking, "Hey, how sure are you?"
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.940]   You start using probabilistic language.
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.940]   You start with your team at your level.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.700]   Now, one of the questions I get is,
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.340]   "What if my boss is this way and it's very stressful for me
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.900]   because they keep telling me what to do.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.020]   They don't really care what I think, on and on and on."
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.660]   And if I'm in a bad mood, I'll say, "Well, you should quit
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.020]   because the toll on your life and your health
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:07.380]   is not worth whatever it is you're making from this job."
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.100]   It might feel like it is.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.140]   "Well, my kid's about to go to college."
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.220]   Like, you'll be dead.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.740]   A more helpful answer is that's usually about,
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.580]   it's always about safety, safety for you,
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.260]   but safety for them.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.500]   When you go to your boss and you say,
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.140]   "Hey, I have an idea about how to do this thing
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.780]   you told us to do a little bit better,
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.740]   or maybe not even do it at all."
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:33.100]   It becomes a contest of authority,
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.900]   which immediately provokes their defense mechanisms.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.300]   So what we would advise is to say,
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.980]   "Hey, this is your call, you want us to do this?
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.220]   We're going to do it."
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:44.620]   And then what's the sequence?
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.660]   Description, assessment, action.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.340]   Would you like to know, choice, how we see it?
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.700]   Description.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.380]   Don't jump to action because that's too far,
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.140]   that's too much vulnerability for you and them.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.940]   So we start with description, safe.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.540]   And again, remember also one, some, all.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:03.980]   So it's just you and me in this room.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.500]   So you can tell me to pack sand,
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.100]   no one's losing face, that kind of thing.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.380]   Then once you earn the right to be heard,
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.660]   then you can have influence.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.180]   And I did this wrong so many times,
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:19.420]   that's why I'm such an expert on pissing my boss off.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.180]   - But it sounds like the playbook
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.460]   for someone not in the leadership role
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.540]   is to just do the same things from beneath.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.820]   And you mentioned earlier
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.300]   that it takes a lot of mental stress out of your head
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.460]   to be in a leadership role like this.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.540]   By starting to do that,
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.660]   maybe you can encourage someone to feel that
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.140]   and perpetuate it.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:43.140]   - Yeah, but I don't want to take quitting off the table.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.300]   That's always got to be on the table.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.100]   I'm not in the Navy anymore.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.900]   At some point, it was great for me for a while,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.980]   but at some point it became not a good environment for me,
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.820]   so I'm not there.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.940]   The leader's job is to create the environment
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.500]   where people can be at their best just the way they are.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.220]   It might mean putting someone in a different environment,
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.180]   and it might mean you.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.020]   Like you're not good in this environment,
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.300]   be in a different environment.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.460]   Don't say, "What do I need to do to be great here?"
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.820]   Say, "Where do I need to be
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.180]   so that I'll be great the way I am?"
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.900]   - I agree a lot of people don't put quitting on the table.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.620]   - Well, it's happening a lot more now.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:25.700]   - Yeah, this has been fantastic.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.860]   Aside from the books,
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.020]   where can people find out what you're working on
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.660]   and get in touch?
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.220]   - Yeah, YouTube channel, Leadership Nudges.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.140]   I put these little one to two minute things out.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.940]   Give me your comments, give me your thoughts.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.340]   The little tidbits, a lot of things that we've talked about.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.660]   One, some, all, or describe, assess, act,
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.380]   those kinds of things.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:47.940]   And then companies called
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.140]   Intempus Leadership International, that's our movement.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.260]   And you can go on LinkedIn, we have a website.
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.860]   You can go on LinkedIn and let us know what you think.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.260]   Tell us your story.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.940]   - I will also post a link in the show notes
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.540]   to the original video that I've shared dozens of times.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.220]   David, thank you for being here.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.460]   - Yeah, thanks so much.
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.700]   And thank you listeners for what you guys do.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.060]   Leadership is hard.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.940]   It's often about going against your innate wiring.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.940]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.700]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.820]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:22.620]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.300]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.380]   Especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.860]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:32.260]   questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:36.500]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.580]   That's it for this week.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.860]   I'll see you next week.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.100]   (electricity buzzing)
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:53.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
