[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E dot com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.640]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.800]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.760]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm incredibly excited to be talking to the
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.640]   one and only Ramit Sethi, who's not only a friend of mine, but is also the
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.960]   author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.680]   A New York Times bestseller with over a million copies sold.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   In this episode, we'll talk about some of the tactical ways you can start
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.000]   living your own rich life.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.640]   We'll talk about the 10 money rules Ramit created to ensure he's living his
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.960]   rich life, talk about some of the ways he's helped couples tackle money issues,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.280]   and some of the invisible scripts that society has created to control our
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640]   financial life and how to overcome them.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.480]   So let's do it.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.440]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.520]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.320]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.080]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.880]   Ramit, thanks for being here.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.120]   Yeah, I am excited.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.000]   I wanted to just kick off because your whole brand is I Will Teach You To Be
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.040]   Rich, and I thought it'd be helpful.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.320]   There's a lot of ideas of what rich is.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880]   For me, my earliest vision is Scrooge McDuck running around in gold coins, but
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.240]   I know that's not what you talk to your audience about.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.800]   What is being rich to you?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.200]   Well, when I ask people that question, they give me back three answers.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.440]   And the first answer is, "I want a million dollars."
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.040]   That's not very satisfying because a million dollars at 20 is different than a
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.880]   million at 60.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.120]   A million in Kansas is different than a million in San Francisco.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240]   And so that's the first answer.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.960]   The next one is, "I just want to pay off my debt."
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.200]   And this is kind of a haunting answer because it's almost like you're
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.520]   underwater and all you want to get is just barely above it.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.040]   And if you've been in debt for a long time, you can understand that one.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.640]   But I don't find it particularly inspiring.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.360]   I think there's got to be more to life than just getting to zero.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.640]   And then the third one is the most common, which is, "I want to do what I
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.200]   want, when I want."
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.800]   And I always say, "Okay, so what do you want?"
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.080]   And then they look at me and just blink.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.160]   Because most of us have never thought beyond a very simple, facile answer.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.960]   So in my opinion, you define rich, not me.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.520]   And rich can be picking up your kids every day from school.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.640]   Rich can be a thousand dollar cashmere sweater.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.080]   And rich can be traveling for eight weeks per year.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.720]   Or it can be just buying a round of drinks for your friends.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.520]   You decide what your rich life is.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.240]   And what's your rich life?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.480]   Well, my rich life is being able to do work that has big impact and work
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.120]   with people I like and respect.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.560]   It's being able to be generous with the people around me.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.040]   It's being able to have a flexible schedule.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.640]   So being able to travel, say, six to eight weeks per year.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.520]   And being able to dream bigger and then realize those dreams every single year.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.560]   One of the interesting things you said is spend time with the people you like.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.720]   You mentioned buying a round of drinks if you want.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   I feel like rich is always something that people talk about.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.480]   Like, "I've got to be rich eventually."
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.680]   But being able to buy a round of drinks for your friends isn't something
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.880]   you need a million dollars for.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.600]   When I started out, I remember being maybe college or right after college.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.560]   And to me, rich was being able to order appetizers.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   Why?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.800]   Because when I was a kid growing up, we never ordered appetizers.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.920]   We would hardly ever eat out.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.160]   When we did, we had a coupon.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.400]   And like appetizers, that was a never going to happen thing.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.440]   Then as I got a little bit older, I remember being in New York, hot August
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.080]   summer, I had to go somewhere for a meeting.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.560]   I got to go down into the depths of hell, into the subway in August.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.760]   And I'm just dripping in sweat.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.080]   And I still cannot figure out how so many guys down there just wearing full
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.520]   suits, looking totally normal.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.640]   I'm dripping.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.200]   Okay.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.800]   And I said to myself, you know, my rich life would be in August, in New York,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.040]   being able to jump in a taxi and not have to worry about how much it costs.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   And anyone who's just a little bit older knows that feeling of sitting in the
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.080]   back of a taxi when you don't have a lot of money, particularly in your early
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.120]   twenties and watching that number just tick up.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.200]   And so many people are like, Oh yeah, I used to be like, Oh, you can just let
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.560]   me off here.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's fine.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.560]   For me, the dream, the rich life was just simply being able to get in a
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.280]   taxi and not have to worry.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   Now, for a lot of us, that number is not very expensive.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.680]   We're talking about 10 bucks a week, maybe 15.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.480]   It's not a lot for some of us.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.640]   It's being able to go to the grocery store and order pre-cut vegetables.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.080]   Okay.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.680]   Another thing we would never, ever do when I was a kid.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.360]   Now time, money value has changed a little bit.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.680]   Of course, my rich life has expanded now, right?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.160]   To be able to travel and do all these things that make the taxi thing look
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.480]   small, but the point is actually not the price of it.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.440]   And that's really important for people to know.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.240]   $10 back then meant the world to me.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.840]   Now the number might be bigger.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.320]   That's great.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.880]   It should be bigger, but you're right that a rich life is not simply about
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.600]   kind of Scrooge McDuck and accumulating money in your spreadsheet.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.840]   That is meaningless.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.160]   Money matters.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.960]   Definitely.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.440]   It's a small but important part of a rich life.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.560]   But the question that I want to challenge everybody is what are you doing with
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.040]   your money to live a rich life?
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.360]   How do people start to figure out when they can start living that rich life?
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   If you have some debt or if you have, uh, you haven't really saved that much,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.000]   but a round of drinks, isn't that expensive?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.520]   How do you think people should decide now I can start doing those things that I want
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.960]   to do, even if they're only 10, 15, $20.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.920]   First off, most people don't think about it in that way.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.080]   Here's what most people do.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.680]   They're torn by two opposing messages.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.720]   The first message is cut back on lattes.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.480]   Don't spend money on jeans.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.840]   Don't go on vacation until you're 75 and maybe just maybe you can afford to take a
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.880]   trip to Italy.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   Then that's the first message.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.320]   And it is drummed into us in our puritanical society from day one.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.000]   Okay.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.800]   So most of us listen to it and we absorb it and we hear phrases like money doesn't
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   grow on trees.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.400]   What do you think?
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.320]   I'm made of money.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.280]   And Oh, if those rich people had to step on somebody to get there, I call those
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.480]   invisible scripts.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.520]   On the other hand, we are bombarded with messages of spending and consumerism.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.040]   Well, my friend who's not even as smart as me is going to Bali on a Wednesday.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.280]   How come I can't do that?
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:14.840]   You know what?
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.240]   I'm going to buy this really nice blank, blank, blank car, sweater, trip, et cetera.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.200]   Those two messages are directly in opposition.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   And in America, the consumerist message tends to win.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.680]   Now, what I would say is I have no problem with spending extravagantly on the things
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.160]   you love.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   As long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't, I would rather
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:43.080]   somebody come and say, you know what, Ramit, I love nice clothes or I love a
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.760]   nice car.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.520]   I say, tell me more, tell me what is your dream car.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.360]   And I would love to get into that.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.960]   And then I would say, great.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.160]   Okay.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.800]   We put that there.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.920]   You want to buy a Tesla?
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.960]   Maybe you can't afford it today, but you know exactly how long it'll take you to
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.320]   get there.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.960]   Cool.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.600]   Yes.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.840]   You're going to get that Tesla.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.040]   Now tell me what you don't care about.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.440]   Well, you know, I don't really, I'm not in the mood to travel for the next couple
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.800]   of years.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.760]   I don't need to buy a house in the Bay area.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.320]   I don't need X, Y, Z.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.880]   Okay, great.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.520]   Let's put that down.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.040]   And suddenly you find someone almost like a barbell.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.880]   They have one side where they have their extravagant spending, really doubling,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.040]   tripling, quadrupling down on the thing that's important.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.680]   And then they have that other side where they consciously say, this is not
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.320]   important to me.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.960]   It's just not a thing for me.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.040]   And I'm going to cut my costs mercilessly here.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.160]   That is a rich life as opposed to the common thing, which is, I know I
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.200]   shouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.080]   And then just feel guilty about it.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.120]   And if you're spending extravagantly on the things you care about, how do you
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.800]   know that it's okay to spend extravagantly without derailing everything?
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.560]   No one wants to work till they're a hundred.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.440]   How do you make sure you're at least setting aside enough to be able to do
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:52.680]   that?
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.840]   Well, my rule of thumb is that you need to get educated about this.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   Okay.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.880]   So when people are turn 40, there are consistent data that show you go ask
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.960]   them, what are you worried about most?
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.920]   They always say the same thing.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.360]   Money.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.440]   Those very same people have never read a single book about personal finance.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.960]   Okay.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.760]   And they're like, Oh, it's so hard.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.840]   It's impossible to save.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.200]   Oh yes, it is very hard.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.320]   And there are a lot of external factors making it increasingly unaffordable.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.160]   And by the way, out of curiosity, when was the last time you picked up a single
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.120]   book on personal finance and read it for one weekend?
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.720]   Oh no, I don't read books.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.800]   I don't do that.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:25.960]   Yes.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.680]   If you want to master your money or even live a comfortable and or rich life.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.240]   You need to be able to speak the basic language of personal finance.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.600]   This is not something that I want people to delegate.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.440]   This is something that I want people to control because it's simple and it
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.520]   directly affects you.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.920]   So that would be things like knowing, Hey, what's a ballpark rate that I should
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.480]   be saving every year?
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.400]   What's a ballpark percentage of income that I should be investing per year?
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.120]   By the way, the answer to that basic numbers would be 10 and 10%.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.760]   I want you to be saving 10% at least.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.440]   I want you to be investing at least 10%.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.960]   I'm speaking conservatively here at the beginning level of personal finance.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.000]   I want you to be able to answer some basic questions.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.240]   How much do I owe?
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.400]   How much do I make?
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.320]   What percent am I saving and investing?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.160]   What are the things I want to spend more on and less on?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.760]   By the way, most people don't know the answer to that question.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.320]   And finally, what are my invisible scripts about money?
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.520]   These are the basic questions that you should be able to answer.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.200]   And you can read my book, I Will Teach You To Be Rich or many other good books on
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.040]   personal finance.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.320]   But as I always say, life is not a Disney movie.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.080]   Nobody's coming to rescue you.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.320]   And so we have to take as much control of this as we can.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.640]   Yeah, the invisible scripts thing is one that I just want to touch on for a second
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   because I think one of the things that I've learned in my career, talking to
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.440]   people about money as well, is that if you have things that you believe and then you
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.880]   do a little research, you might find that they're completely wrong.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.360]   And in my last startup, my co-founder always joked with people.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.080]   He said, "Look, I can buy a house.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.160]   I don't want to buy a house.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.560]   I don't think it's a good deal for me."
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.240]   And people were blown away.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.120]   Are there common invisible scripts that you challenge people to go question that
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.120]   you think people get wrong all the time?
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.160]   The number one invisible script is buying a house is a great investment.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.080]   So like your co-founder, I can buy and I choose to rent.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.000]   And this completely blows people's minds because they look at me, they go, "Wait,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.240]   this is the I will teach you a rich guy.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.680]   He must have some money, right?
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.320]   But he's renting.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.840]   Isn't renting for losers?"
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.800]   That's what I've been taught because, and here come the invisible scripts.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.960]   You're throwing money away on rent.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.400]   You don't want to pay your landlord's mortgage.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.120]   You got to build equity, real estate's the best investment and on and on and on.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.440]   And my favorite response to that is that whole concept about you're
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.680]   paying your landlord's mortgage.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.560]   It's always said very derisively.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.880]   I say, "You know, last time you went out to eat, did you feel guilty about paying
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.080]   the restaurant owner's mortgage as well?"
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.400]   And they look at me like, "That's crazy."
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   And I say, "You know, last time you went out to eat, did you feel you were wasting
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.640]   money as you were throwing it away on a meal, which literally went down the toilet?"
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.160]   "Well, that's different."
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.400]   I said, "Really?
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.000]   Why is it different?"
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.840]   Buying a house in America is religion.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.120]   Real estate is religion.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.720]   And a lot of people don't understand this because we grew up with what could best be
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.760]   termed propaganda that has been advanced by one of the, what I would consider most
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.120]   unethical organizations in America, the National Association of Realtors.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.000]   Then we also have the government who actually has encouraged home ownership,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.400]   which can be a good goal, but when it becomes a sole metric can be driven to
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.640]   drive people who cannot comfortably afford a home to buy one.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.120]   And then all of us, almost all of us have parents who tell us, "You got to buy a
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.480]   house."
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:52.680]   Why?
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.040]   Because they bought a house and it became a source of wealth to them at that time.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.360]   What I want people to do is to really probe and for the biggest purchase of your
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.920]   life, you actually should be quite versed in this stuff.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.560]   And let me give you a simple example of why buying a house may not be the best
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.000]   investment.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.120]   You take somebody who's renting for a thousand dollars a month, easy math, and
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.480]   you see somebody next door who has a mortgage for a thousand dollars a month.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.320]   And you think, "Wow, I might as well get the mortgage because I can build equity,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.080]   et cetera, et cetera."
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.520]   But what you don't factor in is this thing I call phantom costs.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.680]   And that is things like repairing your water heater, roof, maintenance, increased
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.640]   purchases like furniture, and of course taxes, et cetera.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.760]   Those turn out to be quite substantial, in many cases over 50% higher.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.120]   So now suddenly you're talking about $1,000 versus $1,500 a month times 30
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.720]   years. Let's not forget that you could take that $500 and invest it in the
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.040]   market in a simple low cost index fund and often outperform real estate.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.360]   And finally, let's not forget, I know what people are going to say right now,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.560]   "Rameet, you're stupid.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.760]   You're not factoring in that rents go up."
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.520]   That is true.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.000]   Rents do go up sometimes, but rents also go down.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.280]   They're down right now.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.960]   They're down right now.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:10.040]   And in fact, I lived in Manhattan and when I left last year, the prices were as
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.240]   low as I had paid 11 years prior.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.440]   Think about that.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   An entire 11 years erased, okay?
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.160]   The building that I was negotiating with, and this is something, they called me up.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.440]   They go, "Hey, Rameet, we'd love to talk to you about your renewal."
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.680]   Now, I already knew, I keep my eye on the market like a hawk.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.360]   I said, "Okay, what are you offering?"
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.880]   And they go, "Well, you know, we looked around at the data and we can offer you
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.200]   renewal with no price increase."
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.480]   And I knew this guy was a good sales guy.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.320]   So it was like game recognized game because we started having a
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   blast negotiating with each other.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.000]   I said, "Listen, that's not going to work.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.200]   You and I both know the market's down.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.560]   You better come back to me with a better offer."
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.880]   He said, "Okay, I'll call you back next week."
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.760]   He comes back to me, he says, "I can give you one month free."
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.720]   First of all, in New York, in Manhattan, that's not bad.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.480]   That shows that there's a weak rental market.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.720]   I said, "Look, on your website itself, you're giving three months free.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.360]   So you're going to have to do better than that because I can go to the
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.960]   website right now and get that price."
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.240]   He says, "Okay, you've been here 11 years.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.560]   You tell us what you'd like to pay and we'll see if we can make it work."
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.800]   Now that is something that people have almost never heard in a
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.240]   Manhattan real estate market.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.560]   Based on what he was saying and the way he was talking, my estimate is I could
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   have gotten five to six months free in Manhattan.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.000]   Now that is a staggering decrease in rent.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.800]   Staggering.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.400]   Okay.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.120]   So I want to emphasize to people that rent goes up, it also goes down.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.520]   Rent is the maximum you will pay.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.480]   A mortgage is the minimum you will pay.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.160]   Think about that.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.720]   Let me say it again.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.680]   Rent is the maximum you will pay.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.240]   Mortgage is the minimum you will pay when you factor in things
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.080]   like taxes, maintenance, et cetera.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.680]   Finally, some people, Americans really hate the idea of paying
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.640]   someone else's mortgage.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.440]   They just viscerally hate it.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.800]   Americans hate the concept.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.640]   It's an invisible script that we have that someone else is making money off us.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:14.160]   Ironically, then we go and pay 1.25% on these loaded up fees and financial
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.720]   advisors charging AUM, never understanding that they're making tons
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.520]   of money off of us just invisibly.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.400]   So a better way to look at it would be to say your landlord may be making a
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.840]   profit off for you, or they may not.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.200]   They may not even know what number they need to charge in order to make a profit.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.120]   But landlords cannot simply pass the costs on to you.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   They can only charge what the market will bear.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.680]   So that's one big invisible script.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   There are several others.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.480]   There are many, many others.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.560]   I should get married.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.880]   That's a common one.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.040]   There are a lot of people who have decided not to get married
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.160]   or I should have children.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.760]   That's more and more common these days.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.200]   And I'm not saying it's good or bad.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.360]   It's simply an invisible script in our country.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.640]   My parents were terrible with money.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.560]   So I'm terrible with money.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.640]   That's an invisible script.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.960]   And there are a million others.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.840]   What I want to encourage people to do is to dive deeper into your behavior and trace
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.400]   it back to the messages you received growing up, because those have a profound
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.240]   impact on your attitudes and behaviors towards money.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.960]   When you talked about what you did with your landlord, it reminded me a lot about
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.640]   the part in your book where you tell readers how to negotiate like an Indian.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.840]   Yeah, well, I was raised to negotiate.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.760]   I mean, my parents grew up in a culture where they negotiated.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.200]   They moved here in the seventies as immigrants.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.480]   And I think what I learned from them was, why not just ask?
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   And that was the first part, which in America, we don't like to ask because
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.720]   negotiation is seen as cheap and it's very antagonistic.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.600]   That's the way we think about it.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.120]   I personally love it.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.720]   I love, like I had a blast talking to that sales guy over the course of three or four
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.040]   weeks because he knew what I was doing.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.200]   I knew what he was doing.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.000]   We both knew it was a dance and he was not obligated to give me anything.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.360]   Nothing at all.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.520]   He was not obligated just because I asked, but I was not obligated to stay.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.040]   And so we were both involved in this elaborate, intricate dance where he's
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.000]   bringing his skills and he's got his number and I've got my number and my
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.880]   skills and we're bringing them to bear and see what we can come up with.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.240]   Now, I do think that sometimes people take negotiation and they go a little bit too
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.720]   far and this is the second thing I learned from my parents, which is there's a time
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.000]   and a place, okay?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.680]   So if you go to some place like a car dealership where it's totally expected
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   that you negotiate, then you better negotiate.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.560]   You're going to negotiate hard and have fun doing it, right?
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.960]   I write about how my dad would take us to buy a car and to this day, I've never
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.680]   bought a car with someone who goes in there and buys it and leaves on the same
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:47.880]   day.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.360]   Like that's totally foreign to me.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.360]   The way my dad did it, we would go, we'd come home, we'd go back the next day, eat
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.560]   breakfast at the dealer, then we'd negotiate to get go home.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.640]   It was like a four or five day family affair, but you wouldn't do that at a
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.760]   Michelin starred restaurant, okay?
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.240]   And you could try, but you wouldn't do it at McDonald's.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.600]   That's just not the place for it.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.400]   I think what I learned is that negotiation is something that we should use
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.720]   strategically, not be afraid of.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.320]   And when there are opportunities to negotiate, particularly on the big things
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:26.120]   in life, a house, a car, shopping around your interest rates, those can be worth
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.000]   tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.600]   So it pays to have that skill in your back pocket.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.320]   You don't have to flex it all the time.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.000]   In fact, I would say the more financially successful I've become, you know, I tend
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.120]   to negotiate less, but when I do it, it's for a big ticket item.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.520]   The interest rates one is one along with bank fees that I don't think everyone
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.160]   knows you can totally negotiate.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.160]   If you miss a payment, you might not be successful, but you can ask to have that
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.520]   fixed.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.120]   So it doesn't end up on your credit report.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.920]   Late fees are negotiable.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.760]   Are there other things that you've learned that people don't think to
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.000]   negotiate, but would, you know, add a lot of value to their lives?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.520]   In chapter one of my book, I give people the word for word scripts to negotiate
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.840]   these credit cards, bank fees, all those things.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.880]   That's a big one because it's so small.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.760]   It's a $37 fee, but when people do that, they go, oh my God, I actually have
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.640]   power against these multibillion dollar banks and credit card companies.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.400]   So that kind of opens everyone's eyes to realize, oh my God, I can actually do
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.680]   this.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.400]   And $37 is not the point.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.640]   The point is I took some control back.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.400]   I didn't just eat it.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.800]   Yes, there are other things you can negotiate.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.120]   So things like payment terms as a business owner, you can negotiate payment
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.560]   terms with your vendors in terms of traveling.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:48.480]   Of course, if you're staying seven days, you can negotiate very, very
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.600]   favorable terms.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.800]   If you're staying at the same hotel chain, but in different cities, you can
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.080]   contact their ticketing office and you can often negotiate a special rate
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.040]   that's not available.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.600]   But I would say that, you know, travel, cars, real estate, those are the big
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.040]   ones.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.600]   Get those right, as I always talk about the big wins.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.000]   And then, you know, are you going to negotiate at a farmer's market?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.240]   I mean, you could, I don't anymore.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.560]   Okay, so negotiating, I agree.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.800]   Don't go too far.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.640]   I think the two big levers, if you talk to any financial savvy person, is you
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.520]   can spend less or you can make more.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.160]   How do you think about the balance between focusing on trying to make more
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.960]   money or focusing on trying to cut costs?
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:42.760]   Both are important, but I have decidedly come on the side of earning more, right?
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.960]   There's a limit to how much you can cut, but there's no limit to how much you
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.680]   can earn.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.800]   And so while most Americans do have a spending problem, and if you give me 10
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.000]   minutes with your spending, I can point out some big opportunities for you.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.320]   The fact of the matter is that there's a limit to that, okay?
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:08.360]   Yeah, you can cut, but suddenly you're at the coupon cutter table on the 30th of
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.160]   every month and you're sitting there trying to optimize for 38 cents.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.520]   It's a waste of time.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.080]   And this is why I disagree with the common advice, cut back on lattes.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.680]   If you actually run the numbers, $3 a day is not really going to add up to much.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.200]   And there's a substantial cost, which is you're going to be unhappy.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.760]   If you love your morning coffee and you like getting it on the way to work, why
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.480]   are you going to try to guilt yourself all to save $3, which most people, first
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.200]   of all, they're not going to do.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.160]   And second of all, it's not like they're taking that $3 and consistently dollar
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.600]   cost averaging it into the market.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.360]   They're just going to spend it somewhere else.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.960]   So I would rather you say, you know what, I like that.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.000]   I'm going to spend on that.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.920]   I'm going to happily spend on this nice coffee, but I'm going to
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   figure out a way to earn more.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:54.280]   So in my website and in our programs, we show people how to find a business idea,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.320]   how to start it, how to grow it.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.400]   So we have all kinds of business owners.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.480]   We have over close to 50,000 customers and some of them started dog walking
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.160]   businesses, some of them started interior design firms and they did this on the
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.400]   side and then some of them went full time.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.080]   We have some serious entrepreneurs who have started travel businesses
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.560]   and personal styling businesses.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.080]   So there are lots of things that you can do to earn more.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   But I think first, go ahead and get your financial system automated.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.600]   So you're spending less than one hour per month.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.960]   That's when you know, okay, I got all that taken care of.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.600]   I've lowered my financial anxiety.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.480]   Now what's next?
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.040]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.760]   I get it.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.040]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.320]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.400]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.760]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.840]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.880]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.720]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.120]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.640]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.320]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.720]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.240]   yours.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.160]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.400]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.760]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.360]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.400]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.400]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.680]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   What are you spending that one hour on?
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   Okay.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.680]   The way that I set it up is I have a financial automation system.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.440]   This is in my book, or you can find it on YouTube.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.640]   And imagine your checking account is like an email inbox.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   So all your money comes into your checking account, your paycheck, et cetera.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   From there, it is automatically filtered out to different places that it needs to
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.000]   go.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.840]   You're going to have some taken to your Roth IRA perhaps.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.800]   You're going to have some taken to your savings account.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.960]   Within that savings account, you're going to automatically have sub-savings
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.480]   accounts.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:27.040]   So you're going to have a wedding savings account or a travel to Morocco in
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.880]   December account, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.840]   Then you're going to have your credit card being paid off.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.440]   And of course your guilt-free spending.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.360]   You want to go out, you want to buy a round of drinks, you want to buy a
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.680]   beautiful sweater.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.280]   Great.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.400]   What I do for one hour per month now is I review that.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.800]   It's all automatic.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.240]   So by default, it's running.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.600]   I don't have to do anything, but I just take a look at making sure everything
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.840]   has been properly paid.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.240]   That's it.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.520]   Then now I've set up a time with my wife.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.040]   So my wife and I, when I got married, it added some new complexity and
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.880]   opportunities.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.080]   And so every month my wife and I sit down and we discuss our finances.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.520]   So we've built a model and it, by the way, this was the thing when we got
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.880]   married, I was like, let's build the coolest model on earth.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.160]   It's going to be crazy.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.280]   Everything's going to flow.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.040]   And my wife and I were like, she saw money very differently than me.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.000]   I'd been dealing with money for 20 years.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.320]   I was like, let's optimize growth.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.200]   So it took us a long time to get on the same page and be able to build a model
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   that we both own and share and contribute to.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:38.000]   And now when we look at it every month for one hour, we sit down, we look at our
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.760]   expenses.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.480]   Most of the expenses are static.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.280]   Like we basically spend the same amount on groceries every month.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.640]   So within parameters, we don't really care.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.040]   There are a couple areas that are discretionary to us because we tend to
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:51.840]   overspend.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.800]   They're variable, like travel, eating out, things like that.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.280]   So we have a couple of watch areas, like a dentist watches a couple of teeth.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.440]   We watch a couple of areas, but the most important thing, the most important thing
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.680]   in that model is we sat down and we did a bucket list exercise.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:16.440]   I said, in the next 10 years, what do you want to do?
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.720]   What do you want to accomplish?
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   And we sat and we had a beautiful time.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.680]   We sat down and we talked about what are the big things that we want to do.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.280]   I'll give you an example.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.680]   My wife said she wanted to learn another language.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.800]   I said that I wanted to write another book at a hotel.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.360]   I love nice hotels and I love the idea of being in this luxurious place where my bed
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.760]   is made for me and I can go and write in this huge kind of beautiful courtyard.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.280]   Okay, so we kept going and going and we found some things that we want to do
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.800]   together.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.440]   We found some things we wanted to do separately.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:56.200]   So I said, let's pick a couple of them, things that really excite us together and
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.720]   let's put a dollar value to them.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.960]   So we picked 10 year wedding anniversary.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.120]   So we were inspired because some of our friends that we know had a 10 year
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.960]   wedding anniversary in France and they invited a bunch of friends and family and
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.720]   we were blown away.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.520]   We're like, wow, that is, that's, you know, first of all, we don't know anybody
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:21.080]   who's done that and second, what a cool idea to celebrate a 10 year anniversary.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.920]   That's a big deal and it's an opportunity to party.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.640]   When we got married almost 10 years ago, nine years ago, tomorrow, the group of
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.880]   friends that we had then is evolved and some of them are closer, some of them are
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.520]   more distant and I'm constantly thinking, gosh, if we got married now, we would have
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.720]   a different experience and I've never really thought about just having that
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.080]   different experience as a way to celebrate, but I guess I've got 366 days
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.880]   to figure it out.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.560]   Well, early congratulations.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.920]   And so we were inspired and so we said, you know what, let's do that.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.120]   So this is the crux of a rich life.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.960]   We took something that we wanted to do, an intention and a big intention, a 10
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.920]   year wedding anniversary in India.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.760]   We know the exact hotel.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.640]   We know all the friends and family that we want to invite and we know that we
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.880]   want to show them around India if they've never been.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.960]   Like we have this whole vision in our mind and we got excited as we started
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.320]   talking, we started building on each other.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:19.760]   Okay.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.520]   And we should do this.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.400]   And what about that?
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:21.960]   Oh, great.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.520]   And I said, okay, now let's connect it to our finances.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.160]   Okay.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.920]   Cause it's one thing to be a dream.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.120]   Let's make it a plan.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.200]   So I said, okay, I said, how much do you think this is going to cost?
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.320]   Let's write it down separately on separate pieces of paper.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   So it was really funny because she wrote down a number and I wrote down a number
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.000]   and my number was roughly five to 10 times bigger.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.600]   Okay.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.160]   I like to spend extravagantly on things that are important.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.480]   And she was quite nervous because she said like, we're not spending that much.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.760]   And I said, okay, I'll tell you what, this is the way I think about it.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.440]   First of all, this is many years away.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.240]   So we have lots of time to save and invest for it.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:11.360]   Second, for big, big things in life, really big things, I want to accumulate
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.840]   enough that cost is never my primary decision.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.760]   Okay.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.920]   So to give you an example, one day, if, and when we buy a house, I don't want
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.800]   to shop by price as the first thing.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.880]   Same for a car, same for if we get childcare help, I don't want price to be
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.640]   the first factor, or in some cases a factor at all.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.600]   And if you're looking and listening and saying, oh, it must be nice.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.880]   Don't want to have to look at a price of a house.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.800]   Just think about an example that is important to you.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:46.000]   Maybe it's diapers or maybe it's the type of protein shake that you pay for.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.880]   There are things in each of our lives that we do not get the cheapest.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.600]   We don't even look at the price.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.880]   And so whether it's diapers or whether it's a house, obviously
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.600]   those are different scales, but those are important things.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.840]   And so I said to her, look, we've got two different numbers.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.240]   Why don't we just take the bigger number and we don't have to achieve that exact
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:11.320]   number, but if we get even 85% of it, we have done exceptionally well.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   And she was like, okay, let's try it.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.920]   Back to our model.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.680]   Every month during that one hour, we're looking at our goal.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.640]   We have about six or so big goals for the next 10 years.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.080]   We're looking at how much we have targeted for that and how much we have
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.240]   saved and or invested towards that.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.400]   So suddenly it all boils down to our rich life.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.120]   The one hour that you spend is not meant to look at the price of how much you
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.760]   spent on lettuce at the grocery store.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.640]   Nobody gives a shit.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.400]   Oh, I got an extra bag of lettuce and it went rotten.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.600]   Oh, it's so bad.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.160]   That's a $3 question.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.880]   Most of us spend our lives obsessing about $3 questions.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.720]   We should really be asking $30,000 questions.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:01.640]   What are the five to 10 rich life things that we, if you're in a couple, want to
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.720]   achieve together in the next 10 years?
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.120]   How much is it going to cost?
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.080]   Ballpark it and dream big.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.680]   Don't be cheap, dream big.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.480]   And then do we have a plan on how much we need to save and invest every
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.920]   single month to achieve that?
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.320]   At the end of 10 years, if we just do those six or seven things,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.400]   we have lived an amazing life.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.200]   Yeah, I feel like I'm ready to go do this exercise.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.760]   I know I've fortunately had the chance to be with my wife for 16 years now.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:34.280]   So we've had lots of conversations about money and in many ways, it's interesting
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.800]   to meet someone when you have no money and grow together because you
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.040]   learn a lot along the way.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.880]   Are there things, I know this is something, you know, that you've been
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.080]   spending a lot of time thinking about recently.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.560]   Are there things you've learned about how couples and people in relationships
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.720]   manage money that made your life better in that regard?
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.360]   Well, so many surprises when it comes to couples.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:01.840]   So I've had the fortune of being able to talk to couples and they share everything
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.200]   with me.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.520]   They share their numbers.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.040]   I know down to the decimal point, how much they make, how much they spend, etc.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.920]   And that, first of all, is very intimate.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.720]   You know, in my book, I cite a study where people would more likely be willing to
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.000]   talk about their sex lives than their amount of credit card debt.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.480]   So this is highly intimate stuff.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.560]   What I learned when speaking to couples about money is that most of them have
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.360]   never thought about what a rich life means.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.960]   So in their head, they delegate off to someday.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.800]   That's number one.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.640]   Number two, they minimize their problems.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.000]   So I'll get on a call with a couple and I'll say, how important is this to you?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.800]   How serious is this issue to you?
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.320]   Now, remember they have gotten on a call with me and they're sharing all their
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.960]   finances.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.000]   And when I asked him that question, they almost universally go, it's not that bad.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.760]   I mean, you know, he, he does overspend a little bit on this, but it's actually
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.520]   fine.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.400]   I mean, we could make it work.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.320]   And you know, he, he just buys a little bit too much.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.400]   And I go, okay, let's say that he does that now and you've talked about it and he
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.160]   doesn't listen to you.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.120]   Let's fast forward to when you have two kids, what's going to happen then?
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:19.720]   And then suddenly the partner will go, oh yeah, that's going to get worse.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.480]   I say, now what happens if that persists for another 25 years?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:30.640]   And suddenly they can see that a four out of 10 easily becomes a nine out of 10,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.880]   which is divorce level.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:39.400]   So what I want to emphasize to couples is that overspending on a video game or not
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.680]   being too cheap, that's a very common thing that I hear.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.640]   Oh, we have money, but we don't want to spend it.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:51.000]   That is a four out of 10 today, but it quickly turns into a nine out of 10
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.600]   tomorrow.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.960]   So when people say I got divorced because of the dishes, yeah, it was the dishes
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.800]   25 years ago and it mutated and calcified into something way more serious.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.120]   So take control, nip it in the bud, manage that as opposed to waiting and just
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.320]   saying, oh, it'll fix itself on its own.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:09.920]   It never will.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.720]   And do you find that if you tell couples, hey, this could evolve and get worse, are
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.480]   they more receptive to talking about it than they were when you first mentioned
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:18.560]   it?
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.480]   They instantly get it.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.840]   They instantly get it.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.800]   Everyone gets it because we all know couples who fight, everybody, whether
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.480]   you're single or in a relationship, everybody knows a couple.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.920]   You're like, oh, you go home after hanging out with her, you're like, they
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.720]   should not be together.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:40.000]   And you can see that a single little issue can be amplified and magnified to
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.480]   consume a relationship.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.280]   And soon it becomes the ghost in the relationship.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.520]   And I don't want that.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.760]   I'll give you a couple of examples here.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.480]   I spoke to a couple where they told me that their friends call them cheap.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.880]   First of all, if your friends call you cheap, you're cheap.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.160]   Okay, that's a good rule of thumb.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.040]   And I said, are you cheap?
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.000]   They said, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.240]   We just prefer to spend consciously on the things that we like.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.200]   I said, okay, you guys have read chapter four of my book.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   Okay, well, I'm going to probe on this.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.160]   So I said, what do you like to spend on?
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.400]   They said, well, we like to save, but we'll spend on, uh, health
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.480]   food and stuff like that.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:17.800]   Great.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.760]   I says, why do your friends call you cheap?
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.200]   Well, they say that we've lived here for five years and we have no furniture.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.560]   I was like, okay.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.000]   And they say that when we go out to eat, we will, we want to order the
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.560]   steak, but we order the chicken.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.080]   I was like, okay.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   I'm like checking a box on my notepad.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.240]   And then my friend invited me to her bachelorette party, but the
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.480]   invitation came out of nowhere.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.400]   I wasn't expecting it.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.640]   And it was $600.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.640]   So that wasn't fair to expect me to pay $600.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.040]   Like all of these things have good rationale and they have good logic behind
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.400]   them for why they didn't want to spend it.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.920]   But ultimately then I asked them one single question.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.240]   What's your household income?
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.360]   $600,000.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:03.040]   So at $600,000, they're agonizing over $600 for a bachelorette
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.160]   party and chicken versus steak.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.920]   No, that's cheap.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.840]   And it took me pointing it out to them.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.960]   For them to almost be visibly shaken and to say, oh my God.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.800]   And when you fast forward that, they said, when we have X dollars and when we've
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.040]   worked Y years, we're going to start spending.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.960]   So you're telling me at age of 68, you're going to suddenly turn into these
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.600]   National Geographic explorers and you're going to learn the skills
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.160]   of spending very unlikely.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.520]   I feel like you might've been telling a story about my wife and I, who also have
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.720]   a problem where I think I grew up never thinking I'd find a job I loved.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.480]   And so I thought, man, one day I'll need enough money that I don't have to work.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   Not because I can't work because I want to love what I do.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.720]   And now I finally feel like I found something that I love doing,
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.280]   but the switch didn't flip.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.880]   So I feel like we need to have one of these sessions sometime because I really
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.680]   feel like I'm the person who's maybe not even ordering the chicken, maybe just
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   ordering two appetizers instead of the steak.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.760]   I appreciate you saying that because in America, almost 90 plus percent of
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.000]   financial education is geared towards people who don't have enough money.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.880]   Okay.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:21.360]   It's like save and you should cut coupons and all these kind of nickel and dime
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.120]   type of pieces of advice that people give.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.200]   And we've all seen this stuff.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.360]   Read any mass market publication and it'll say stuff like put your vegetables
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.240]   in a Ziploc bag because they'll last an extra two days.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:34.600]   Okay.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.280]   And fine.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.240]   There are, when you're starting out or when you're on a low income, you do need
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.200]   different types of advice in terms of saving money.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:41.920]   Fair enough.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.200]   But there's a very neglected group of people in this country, which is people
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:52.800]   who have started to save, earn and invest money and now they have no idea what to
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.240]   do with it.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.400]   And you're right.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.640]   I love the way you described that.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.080]   That switch does not flip magically.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.760]   And if you have been operating under scarcity and saving for the last 40 or 50
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.320]   years of your life, it becomes virtually impossible to change it.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.040]   If you're listening to this, think about your parents or any relatives, you know,
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.520]   who have enough, maybe they're in their sixties or seventies, they have enough.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   And yet, what do they talk about?
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.080]   I got to save more.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.720]   I got to save more.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.360]   I spoke to a couple who was older and I said, looking back on your life, if you
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.720]   could go back to your 20 year old self and give them some advice, what would you
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.000]   do?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.120]   And they said, save more.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.600]   And I happen to know their financial situation.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.160]   I said, but you have more than enough now.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.120]   What would you have done with the extra money?
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.880]   And they just looked at me.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.600]   They'd never thought about it.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   They were operating off an automatic script that we need to save more.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.800]   But there is a point at which you have saved too much.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.960]   Let me say that again for people, because you've probably never heard that.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.120]   There is a point where you have saved too much.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.640]   What do you do then?
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.840]   Do you think you're going to just magically say, oh my gosh, the math
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.760]   equation revealed itself on my Excel spreadsheet, cell C3.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.920]   That's it.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.880]   I'm quitting my job.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.240]   We're traveling the world.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.200]   Of course not.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.120]   And I think Chris, you know this better than anyone because you realize that the
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:24.480]   cage you created around yourself, the way you articulated it to yourself was, I
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.040]   need more money.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:31.480]   But really that cage was one created of your own mind and you could have stepped
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.360]   out of that cage at any time.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.040]   And if you don't step out today, that cage will only get more and more
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.880]   fortified.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.440]   It will become harder and harder to step out.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.040]   So I'm not encouraging anyone to just quit their jobs and go travel the world
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.680]   24/7.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.000]   That would be unlikely.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.080]   But what I am saying is there has to be a whole new money lens.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.000]   You have to turn the page in the chapter of your life and say, I won.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.960]   I won chapter one.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.760]   Now I'm on to chapter two and chapter two is really about spending on the
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   things I love, not looking for the best value.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.280]   It's actually saying, you know what?
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.360]   I don't need an ROI on this.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.760]   I'm just going to do it because I want to.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.400]   And that, especially when you're partnered with someone who also grew up and is in
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.960]   chapter one is incredibly difficult.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.480]   Often takes bringing somebody like me in to help guide you through that process.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.360]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:39.160]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes, deals
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.880]   and discounts from our partners.

[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.520]   You talked about taking time off to travel.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.760]   You talked about planning this epic 10 year anniversary trip.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.800]   Travel is something that I think both of us have found ways to spend money on.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.440]   And while sometimes I play the points and miles game, cause I don't want to spend
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.480]   money, I've at least been able to take amazing vacations and I know you have a
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.360]   ton of kind of tips, tricks, hacks, and that's the theme of this show.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.880]   So can you talk a little bit about travel and the things you've done and
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.120]   evolved the way you travel to make it better?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:18.440]   Yes.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.040]   But first, are you actually going to spend any money on traveling?
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.640]   Cause every time I talk to you, you're like burning points, which is awesome.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.800]   You've taught me a lot about points.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.360]   Are you ever going to actually spend cash on traveling?
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.240]   I have taken one trip where we spent money, like real money, but I don't know.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.120]   I have all these miles.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:36.960]   I got to use them.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.440]   But do you recall, I'm going to share this with everybody.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.240]   So one, one time we were meeting in New York, we're exchanging tips about
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.840]   travel and stuff and you go, Hey, do you know where I'm staying right now?
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.160]   I go, no, we know which hotel.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.400]   There's a lot of good hotels in the city.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:58.920]   You were staying at an airport hotel near JFK because it was free points and you
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.960]   had to optimize some triple challenge thing or whatever, and you were going to
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.120]   go there after we finished meeting to fly out.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.520]   Now, first of all, I thought that was brilliant because I never thought about
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.800]   staying in an airport hotel for whatever point thing you told me.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.280]   And then I said, Chris, dude, I think you make pretty good money.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.120]   Is it time for you to spend money on a hotel near where you are?
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.520]   What do you think?
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.800]   Yeah, I think the answer is I'm learning.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.560]   Do you want me to just plan your next trip?
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.240]   I'll do it, but all it requires an unlimited budget.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:30.880]   Oh man.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.920]   Will you do it?
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.440]   I unlimited.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.800]   I won't bankrupt you.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.720]   You will have the time of your life.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.520]   I don't know if I could comfortably make a decision, although I guarantee you my
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.480]   wife would say yes.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.080]   Oh really?
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.560]   So I think we could do it.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.640]   Oh my God.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.840]   This is crazy.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.040]   Okay, hold on.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.800]   I need to understand this because I'm, I didn't expect you to say yes.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.000]   So your wife wants you to spend more on traveling?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.200]   I think yes.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.160]   And why is that?
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.480]   It's not just about spending for the sake of spending.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.640]   Why does she want that?
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.600]   We both love travel.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.840]   We've taken months off to backpack.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:13.640]   We've stayed in amazing places and I, we've saved enough that we can.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.440]   And we sometimes let life get in the way.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.080]   Meaning?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.160]   Meaning so I can, here's a great example.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.720]   It's a, in the middle of June, we've identified that in July, we don't have any
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.480]   obligations.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:33.600]   We're still able to work remote and we could take one to four weeks and, and be
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.080]   anywhere.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.800]   We can't stop working for four weeks and my parents are in town and not going
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.360]   anywhere.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   And they could watch our daughter and we could take a trip, whether it's a weekend
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.600]   or a week, and we're a little paralyzed of all of the options to even figure out
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.680]   what to do, where to go and how to have a good time.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.200]   But we both want to do it.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.520]   And somehow our crazy desire to get a deal is getting in the way.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:57.920]   Okay.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.640]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.560]   We gotta, we gotta go deeper on this for just a second.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.280]   This has now turned into my podcast, but I love this and I think this is very
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:04.800]   revealing.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.320]   So first of all, the fact that your parents can watch your daughter is amazing.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.160]   You have flexible ability to travel.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:11.920]   Amazing.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.680]   Budget is not primarily the issue.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.760]   You could spend it if you wanted to.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.560]   That's great.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.200]   Is it being paralyzed by all the options or is it the need to find a deal?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.520]   It's definitely the latter.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   The deal.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.800]   I finally evolved to paying someone to do groceries and I felt really good about
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.320]   that move.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.440]   But I'm like on Amazon and Amazon now has, you can order from Whole Foods, you
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.480]   can order from Amazon Fresh and I'm the person that like pulls the cart up on
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.960]   one, mirrors the cart on the other and then does the thing that's the worst,
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.320]   which is tries to just do both.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.360]   And now I got to meet the $35 minimum on each.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:49.880]   Crazy.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.120]   Okay.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   So, so again, let's just set some context around this.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.960]   If groceries are a substantial part of your budget every week, then it makes
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.680]   sense that you might say, Hey, I'm going to try to save.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.440]   I might go to Costco, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.840]   If you're in the financial situation that you are, where you're earning more than
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:15.360]   you need for Whole Foods, et cetera, then you understand intellectually that it's
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.920]   a complete waste of your time to be doing this and your time would be better
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.320]   spent spending time with your family or honestly just browsing on Reddit.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.400]   Anything except for this.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:31.080]   So what is it about that that makes you want to keep comparing $3 price on baking
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:31.400]   soda?
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:38.680]   I think the satisfaction of checking out and being like, I managed to from the
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.200]   same company, I managed to find the arbitrage opportunity.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:50.160]   The unsweetened applesauce is $2.50 from Whole Foods and $4.79 at Amazon Fresh.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:50.880]   Outrageous.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.360]   And it doesn't matter except that I feel so good that I kind of like stuck it to
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:55.920]   Amazon.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.680]   You got them.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.080]   Okay.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:01.880]   So this is what I'm talking about when I say turning the page in your book of
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.280]   life.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.320]   So it's true.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.160]   I totally get it.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.080]   There are certain things that I do that are irrational and I'm not saying you
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.480]   should just stop feeling that way because you're never going to stop.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   You're always going to want the deal and that's fine.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:18.960]   But at a certain point, what I would suggest is to redirect and find joy in
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.800]   something else.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.320]   Okay.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.000]   Because you've already won the game of personal finance in chapter one.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.080]   You really have.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.840]   So yes, $2, $4.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.200]   Okay.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:33.680]   You want to find a deal every quarter, focus it on one thing, feel good.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.040]   Great.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.760]   But what I would encourage you as you turn that page into chapter two of
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.000]   personal finance would be where else can you find joy?
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.120]   So I want to give you an example with your wife.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.240]   You have the opportunity to travel somewhere.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:51.440]   Let's put deals aside, putting your wife first in this case, what would be truly
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.200]   joyful to her?
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.800]   What is something that she loves when traveling?
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.560]   Examples would be a pool in your room, right?
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.760]   In your own private backyard, a beach set up, hiking.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.560]   What would be the thing that would be like mind blowing?
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.240]   I'll give you some examples from my own life because my wife and I went through
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.880]   this exact thing, same thing too.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.800]   We sat down and we planned out our honeymoon and we were inspired by other
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.240]   people who were a little older than us.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:26.280]   They said, Oh, we were planning to go on like an eight day safari, which was very
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.000]   exotic to us.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.600]   We'd never been.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.400]   And they go, that sounds awesome.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.960]   When we got married a long time ago, we took six months off.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.080]   We're like, what?
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.320]   And then the next couple was like, yeah, we took a year off.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:36.920]   We traveled the world.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.120]   We're like, who are these people?
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.320]   Thought they were just normal.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.000]   And as we walked out of there, my wife and I kind of looked at first, we were like,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.760]   those people are crazy.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.400]   But then we said, Hey, what if we did that?
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.680]   What if we, I mean, we both work remotely.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.600]   Could we do it?
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.080]   And we shifted into that what if mode.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.800]   And so we started to dream and really dream big, similar to our 10 year plan.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.080]   And we said, okay, what do we want on this trip?
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.840]   So I had a list of places I wanted to go and they were not geographically related
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:08.360]   whatsoever.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.200]   They're all over the place.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.160]   But both of us independently said, we want to bring our parents for part of it.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.600]   Our parents are alive.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.320]   They're mobile.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.200]   They enjoy time with us and with each other.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.840]   And so we said, you know what?
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.160]   First stop, Italy.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.240]   It's safe.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.480]   Everybody loves cheese.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.920]   And we told our parents to show up at the airport.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.800]   That's all you have to do.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.640]   And they came and we planned this trip.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.000]   You know, my mother-in-law, she had never been to the Vatican.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Actually, they had never really left the country.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.880]   So we, you know, had cars pick them up and we took them to the Vatican behind the
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.440]   scenes tour.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.120]   Very meaningful.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:42.600]   Okay.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.000]   Not about how much we spent, but about going.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.640]   For example, we went to a farmer's market with a chef, picked vegetables, and then
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.440]   went and cooked like four or five courses together with him.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.960]   Like all of us are hands dirty and making pasta together.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.560]   We will always remember that meal.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.480]   Incredibly meaningful to us.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:06.560]   What I would suggest in this chapter two of your personal finance life would be to
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   say, find the joy in creating the most meaningful experience for you and your
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.000]   wife.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.160]   Meaningful.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.120]   That can be adventure.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:22.520]   It can be sitting by a beach for seven days, you know, very nice hotels.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.880]   So you find, I think, joy in certain hotels.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.760]   It could be, I want to stay at this hotel or this city.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.680]   It could be bringing friends with you if that's what you want.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.440]   Price comes second when it comes to the most meaningful things in life.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:38.040]   And in some cases, price isn't even a factor at all.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:45.280]   If you can get to that point where you have this opportunity, you have time, you
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:53.000]   have money, and you forcibly turn that page, that can be one way to get into the
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.760]   next stage of personal finance for you.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.800]   All right.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.680]   I got homework.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:57.600]   Great.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.680]   I do want to come back because I know you have some travel things that you do.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.320]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.400]   That I think people want to hear.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:10.240]   So when I travel domestically for work, I like to try to stay on my fitness plan and
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.120]   nutrition plan.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   And you know, if it's like one day, it's no big deal.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.720]   But if I'm staying somewhere for three or four days, what I'll do is I'll have food
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.840]   sent ahead of time.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.160]   And this is like a very inexpensive way to do it.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.560]   I have Whole Foods.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.800]   My assistant will coordinate.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.160]   She knows exactly what I eat.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.560]   And so she will have somebody deliver it from Instacart, Whole Foods, etc.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.720]   It will show up at the hotel and she'll make sure that there's a fridge in the
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.040]   room.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.120]   And it's all like the exact foods that I would eat at home.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:45.160]   And so even if I'm going to go out to dinner with a co-worker or somebody in a
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.520]   city, I know that in the morning I'm going to eat right.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.320]   Probably at lunch I'm going to eat right.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.440]   And it just keeps me on plan, keeps me feeling really good.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.960]   And it's all kind of effortlessly handled.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.920]   So that's one.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.360]   Again, think about it.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.400]   You would have had to essentially be a king to do this 40 years ago.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:08.440]   Now you can have it almost automatically done by logging on to Instacart and
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.680]   having it delivered to the hotel and they will keep it refrigerated for you until
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.240]   you arrive.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.560]   So that's awesome.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.160]   I love that.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.360]   Also really, really love when we travel.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.440]   I learned this from a friend of mine.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.680]   My friend was big in the museum world.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:28.440]   And one time he told me, he goes, if I go to a new museum, I'm spending 90 minutes
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.640]   there max.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.080]   And the first 30 minutes are at the cafe.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.480]   And I was like, what?
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.040]   Because when we grew up, we never went to museums.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:42.600]   And on the rare occasion we did, we would spend all day there, like all day, because
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.440]   we were never going back.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.280]   And it was expensive.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.320]   Same as Disneyland.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.360]   We get there when it opens and my parents would drag us out of there crying and
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.320]   tired by the end of the day because we're never going back there.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:52.880]   Okay.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.880]   So the fact that my friend said, I'm only spending 90 minutes and 30 minutes in the
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.280]   cafe kind of blew my mind.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:06.160]   And what he really meant was, I'm going to be abundant enough to know that I can
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.880]   always go back.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.760]   I don't have to see everything the first time.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.440]   So when my wife and I travel, we will, we now have a rule for ourself.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.360]   We don't want to go anywhere for less than four days.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.440]   Four days is the amount for us that it's leisurely enough that we can get to know a
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.000]   place, not be in a rush.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.880]   We're totally comfortable saying we don't want to see that.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:29.280]   And that was a huge abundant moment for me where I realized I don't have to see
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.160]   every monument and museum.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.360]   I can choose the things I do.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.560]   And then we go super deep on the things we do.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.960]   So for example, in Kyoto, my wife and I love design.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.600]   So we arranged, first we made some, I love stationary too.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.200]   So first we made notepads by hand with this old stationary master.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:53.520]   And then we arranged to visit this couple who invited us into their house and their
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.240]   architects.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.240]   And so they shared how the Japanese live differently than Americans.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:05.280]   And they gave us quite a bit of, we talked a lot about design in Japan versus
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:05.880]   America.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.920]   And that was crazy to be able to find a couple who would allow us into their house.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   That's kind of rare there.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   And they happened to be architects, so they could comment on design.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.720]   I had all these questions that I wanted to ask.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.360]   To me, that was super, super meaningful.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:24.360]   And so for anyone traveling, I would just encourage you kind of thinking about what
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:24.960]   do you love?
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.320]   What really gets you off?
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.080]   And it could be weird.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.800]   Like I love notepads and stationary.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.440]   Where did you find these people?
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.720]   So this is the question.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.800]   This is the, so these days, the easiest place to start is Airbnb experiences.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.480]   That's very easy and you can find amazing stuff.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.760]   We always do a food tour whenever we go to a city.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.720]   It's a great way to get to know a place that you talked about that in an earlier
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:51.200]   podcast, and we also, for some of the more obscure stuff, like the architect
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.680]   people, that you have to often make special arrangements.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:59.600]   So we had a specialty tour guide who we said, this is the kind of stuff we want.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.200]   Can you help us arrange it?
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.840]   And that, that took time and money to arrange, but honestly, we would rather
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:12.960]   spend on that than just seeing a random monument that has no meaning to us.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.240]   Any other travel or non-travel financial kind of, I'll say hacks because that's
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.040]   the show that you've learned over the years?
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.320]   Yeah, I have one called Ramit's book buying rule.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.640]   And that is, if you ever see a book that you're interested in, just buy it.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.760]   Don't debate, don't agonize, don't equivocate, just get it.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.800]   Because one line of one book can transform your life.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.880]   And I don't just say that because I'm an author.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.160]   I live it myself.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:45.240]   I buy any book that looks remotely interesting and worst case, I'm out 10 or
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.480]   15 bucks, best case, changes my life.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:52.880]   I think that is actually one, or at least part of one of your money rules.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.280]   I thought it was fascinating to read through how you've kind of framed.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.920]   These are the things that are important to me.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.160]   I know if you just search Ramit's money rules, you can find them, but can you
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.960]   talk a little bit about why you did that and how it's changed things?
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:12.000]   I created the 10 money rules because I wanted to boil down all the ways I look
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.480]   at money in life into 10 simple, easy rules that helped me manage the millions
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.200]   of decisions I'll have to make about money.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.560]   So I'll give you a couple of examples.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.720]   Save 10%, invest 20% of gross annual income.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.280]   That's sort of a standard, no big deal.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.240]   That's not a surprise.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.640]   But how about this one?
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   Never question spending on books, appetizers, health, or donating
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.120]   to a friend's charity fundraiser.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.640]   And this one is deeply personal to me.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.840]   Appetizers, as you know, I used to never be able to afford it.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.800]   So it's funny.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.520]   Why am I talking about appetizers?
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   That's why.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.160]   But donating to a friend's charity fundraiser.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.640]   I know this because I've done charity fundraisers and it was really meaningful
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.520]   when my friends donated to support me.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.560]   So that's one.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.200]   Then we get into kind of bigger rules.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   One of them is be able to pay in full for large expenses, like a wedding,
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.080]   dream honeymoon, or even a house.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.440]   That's a big one.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.320]   That's not practical for most people.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.160]   And if you're listening to this saying, wait, so you're going
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.400]   to pay all in cash for a house?
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.000]   Well, I don't know if I'm going to pay or not, but I want, I will be able to.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.280]   And that's my rule.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   It's not your rule.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.120]   It's not anybody else's rule.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.600]   It's the rule that fits me like a handmade glove.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.200]   So these rules are not for you, Chris, or for any listener.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   These are my rules.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.160]   And that's what I want everybody to do is create their own rules.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.000]   A couple of others, business class on flights over four hours.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.440]   This is just simple.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.120]   It just helps me decide, okay, it's going to be three hours and 30 minutes.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.440]   It could be business or economy, but if it's four hours and 30 minutes, business.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.040]   That's like my rule, which is business class.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.880]   If you can find the points available and like middle seat in the back of the
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.680]   plane and basic economy, if you can.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:05.840]   You know, there's an old phrase that goes, the more successful I became, the
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.480]   less I could afford to do some of the things I used to do and what that person
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:17.000]   meant by that Jim Rohn was, I used to mow my own lawn, but now when he became much
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.560]   more financially successful, he realized he would rather spend that time with his
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.080]   kids.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.080]   And so I think for you, Chris, one thing is like, yeah, you became a lot more
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.600]   successful.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.960]   You might not be able to afford back row, middle seat.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.120]   Now, could you?
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.160]   Yes, you could, of course, but it takes almost that nudging and pushing to say
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.440]   that's not the kind of life I want to live now.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.760]   And I think that's what these rules are about.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.520]   A couple more that I want to share, buy the best and keep it as long as possible.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:51.280]   So for example, I have a car that I've had for 16 years now.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:51.960]   I still drive it.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:52.840]   I drove it here.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.680]   It's great.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.360]   It's a great, nice car.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.800]   It's a Honda Accord.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.720]   I mean, Indians love Honda Accords, not that important to me, right?
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.600]   So when I say spend extravagantly on the things you love, cut cost mercilessly on
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.680]   the things you don't, this car works fine.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.840]   It runs like brand new.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.960]   Cool.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   On the other hand, taking my parents, both sides to Italy for this amazing
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.840]   honeymoon, totally worth it and marry the right person.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.160]   So one of the biggest financial decisions and life decisions you
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.400]   will ever make is who you marry.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.920]   Thinking about, are you aligned with them, values?
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.960]   You don't necessarily need to know everything about money in the same way.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.200]   You don't have to have the same amount of money, but are you both generally
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.440]   oriented towards your money values?
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.040]   I think that is really important.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.360]   Chris, these money values and these money rules, the thing about
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.960]   them is they're not restrictive.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.440]   You notice that when people try to create their rules, they're like,
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.560]   never spend money on X, Y, Z.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.080]   But with these rules, what I wanted to show you is they're really freeing.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.280]   They're permissive.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.600]   They actually let me think bigger.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.920]   Business class on flights, donate to my friends, charity, fundraisers,
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.600]   no limit for spending on health.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.240]   These are awesome rules.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.640]   They fit me like a glove.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.840]   And so if you're listening, I would really challenge you.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.200]   Create your own 10 money rules or even five and send them over to me.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.000]   Tag me on Instagram or Twitter.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.040]   I'd love to see the kind of rules that your listeners come up with.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.880]   And you write back.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.280]   I read everyone.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.920]   I try to write back as much as I can.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.520]   But you're not someone who just ignores everything that comes in.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:27.920]   No, no.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.160]   I write back to hundreds and hundreds of people every day through email, my
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.960]   email list, my Instagram, Twitter.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.680]   I love it.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.800]   I absolutely love hearing from everybody because your rich life
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.840]   is so different than mine.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.280]   And so every day I'm getting exposure.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.720]   You know, I have readers, they retire at 36.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.280]   They live in a trailer and drive around the country.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.960]   That's not my rich life, but I love hearing when people really hone in.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.200]   I want to foster all these pets.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.480]   Awesome.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.200]   I don't want a single pet, but I love hearing people really dialed into what
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.520]   they love to do with their money.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.360]   I love that we didn't talk about investing, which is something that I
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.920]   think a lot of people think is the only money thing that matters because as much
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.720]   as I believe that it's something that matters and if you want to grow your
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.600]   wealth in the longterm, it's necessary.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.000]   It's also not something you need to occupy your entire headspace with.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.480]   Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:25.120]   I mean, I invest, I invest aggressively and I detail all of how I invest in my
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:31.600]   book, but I spend less than 10 minutes a month thinking about it.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.080]   Investing should not be exciting.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.920]   Investing should not be a TNT drama.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.880]   Investing should be absolutely boring and mundane, like watching concrete dry.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.680]   And a rich life is lived outside of the spreadsheet.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.360]   It's not about logging into all your bank accounts and investing accounts.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.920]   No, that's all automated.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.080]   A rich life is lived outside the spreadsheet.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.400]   That is taking your wife on a beautiful vacation.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.960]   That is surprising your family with a thoughtful gift or just emptying the
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.680]   dishwasher.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.440]   It doesn't even have to cost money.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.960]   A rich life is not about tracking every last dollar and cent, although you should
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.560]   have the system set up to do that.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:23.040]   It's really about using your money to create that vision of what a rich life
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.800]   is, and then living that now, not just waiting for tomorrow.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.040]   Couldn't agree more.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.520]   I literally spent the last 18 months trying to focus on automation of finances
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.960]   to get it to a point that you don't even have to think about it.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.320]   So thank you for all the tips, all the tricks, everything you shared.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.640]   I really appreciate it.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.440]   Where, you mentioned a few times, but where's the best place to find you?
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.680]   You can find me at iwt.com and I have a newsletter there with several
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.480]   hundred thousand people.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.440]   I write about money, psychology, business, careers, and many more things.

[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.640]   I'm @ramith.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.520]   You can find me there.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.160]   Cool.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   Thank you for being here.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:00.720]   Thanks a lot.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.240]   Wow.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.440]   That was a lot of fun.

[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.200]   Oh, still here?
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.040]   Remember that conversation about Ramit trying to plan my next trip?
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.640]   Well, even though I'm actually terrified with what he might spend, I was totally
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.200]   serious.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.880]   So if he's serious too, I'm going to make it happen and I'll let you know where we
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.760]   end up going and how the trip goes.
