[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   It seems not many people are happy with themselves.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We all want to be thinner or stronger, taller or shorter, happier, healthier, smarter, you name it.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   There's a myriad of things we'd like to change about ourselves.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   The Christian life includes a process of change as well.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Change away from our self-centeredness and towards God-centeredness.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   We call this process of change sanctification.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   The Gospel of Jesus Christ makes this change possible,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   but that doesn't mean our spiritual and moral growth comes easily for us.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Especially when it comes to patterns of sin in our lives, change can be very hard.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And one of the most important questions in our life then is this,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   "Where can I find the power for permanent change in my own life?"
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   It's a question Pastor John addressed in one of his sermons on John 1, verses 14-16.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   The sermon is titled "The Life-Giving Voice of the Son of God," back from 2009.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Here's a clip from that message.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   full of grace and truth," verse 16,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   "and from His fullness we have all received grace upon grace."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So John saw, heard, and touched the Word of God living, the Son of God.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And he saw His glory.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   He saw that it was the glory of the only Son of God.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   He saw that glory radiant with, overflowing with grace and truth.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And then he says in verse 16, "And we have received grace upon grace in seeing that."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And so the way I understand it,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   when God grants us the eyes to see Jesus for who He really is, that is glorious,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   a beam of glory, light, spiritual recognition comes into our souls,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and along that beam comes powerful grace.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Grace upon grace.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And that grace changes you in ways you don't even know need to be changed.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Things will be wrought in this room tonight, today,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   that you can't predict and are totally designed for you by your hearing the Word
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and by hearing it see the glory of Christ.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Because Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3.18, "Beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   we are being changed from one degree of glory to the next."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That's how people change.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   They see Him.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So, there's the agenda in every sermon.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Unfold some new glimpse of the glory of Christ.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Say it as clearly and as faithfully to the text as I can.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Call down the anointing of the Holy Spirit on me
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and the opening of the Holy Spirit for you.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Have the light shine into your heart.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Grace upon grace flows down the beam of that glory into your heart
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   and the power of God's grace changes you in ways you don't even know that you need to be changed.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Things are awakened.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Possibilities of walking with God that you never thought you could experience,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   ways of relating to Him, leaning on Him, enjoying Him, being satisfied in Him, following Him,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   rise up in your hearts.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I'm talking about a kind of faith that is an experience.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's not just knowledge in your head.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's like eating bread and drinking water, tasting honey.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And the more you see of Christ for who He really is in His Word, by His Spirit,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   the more you taste Him, the more you savor Him, the more you know Him, the more you treasure Him,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and it's these experiential dimensions of faith which change you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   As long as you're just thinking thoughts about Him, you don't get changed.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But when you start tasting the glory of those thoughts,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   when satisfaction in Christ lands on you, changes happen.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Beautiful. That was an excerpt from the sermon titled "The Life-Giving Voice of the Son of God" from John Piper.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It was preached on September 13th, 2009, and you can find the entire sermon at DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Related to this, one of the very earliest episodes of this podcast series is titled "The Essential Warfare for Holiness."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That was episode number 13, way back episode number 13, and you can find that in the archive.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   But how do I get to the podcast archives, you ask?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Well, one of the easiest ways to find episode 13 and all of the now almost 400 other episodes
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   is through the Ask Pastor John app for the Apple and Android devices.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   The Ask Pastor John app is free of charge to you.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   In the updated app for the iPhone, you can access the entire archive of episodes,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   and you will see a search bar at the top of the screen as well.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   From here, you can search all the titles.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   If you don't see these features in your app, make sure you update.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   We've already heard from users who have been at coffee shops with friends who have a question
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   and have opened the app and searched and found and played an episode and listened together,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   which is very cool and very encouraging to us.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   On the Android side of things, up until now, Android users could only access the last eight episodes or so in the app,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   but our developers are putting the final touches on adding these new valuable features,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   the entire archive, and the valuable search function to the Android app.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   If you're an Android user, be sure to keep your eye out for the soon-to-come new release of the app
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   to get all those features that make it really easy to search and browse every episode we have released in the past
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and all the episodes we plan to release ahead.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Well, we will be back tomorrow to ask John Piper, "Should we expect to hear the verbal voice of God today?"
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   [ End ]
