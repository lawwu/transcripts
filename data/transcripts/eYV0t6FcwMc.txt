[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the well-known words that are to
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.640]   be found in the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter and the sixteenth verse.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.080]   The sixteenth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.720]   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:41.600]   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:51.320]   We looked at this great statement last Sunday evening, and as we did so, I indicated that
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.080]   while this is possibly the most familiar and well-known verse in the whole Bible, that
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.320]   it is nevertheless true to say that there is no verse, perhaps, which is so frequently
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.960]   misunderstood and misinterpreted as this particular verse.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.920]   Nothing is therefore more fatal with this verse than just to repeat it generally, as
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.840]   if it were some kind of incantation.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.480]   It is a verse that must be examined and observed carefully, because, as I indicated to you
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:37.640]   in passing, it is a verse that is literally packed with very fundamental and vital Christian
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.400]   doctrine.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.440]   The very fact that it is connected with the previous verses should open our eyes to that
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.400]   at once, but it is extraordinary how people almost invariably isolate this verse.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.680]   The Bible in front of me, for instance, starts a new paragraph here, which is obviously quite
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   nonsensical.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   You should not start a new paragraph when the first verse in the statement is the word
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   "for."
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.720]   It is a continuation of what he has been saying, not only in verses 14 and 15, but
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.640]   indeed all the way from verse 11.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.040]   And thus, as we come back to it, I trust that we shall bear these preliminary considerations
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   in our minds.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.360]   No, it is not my intention this evening or at this present time to deal with the great
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.160]   doctrines that are contained here one by one.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.840]   We have already been looking at several of them as we have been working our way through
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.200]   this great chapter.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   I am rather anxious once more to look at what is, after all, the central theme of this
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.600]   verse, and that is the love of God as it is displayed in the salvation of men.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.160]   That is the thing that our Lord was anxious that Nicodemus should grasp above everything
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   else.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.040]   Now, again, here is a point which we must not lose sight of.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.440]   These words were spoken to that great man Nicodemus, a Pharisee, a ruler, a teacher
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280]   of the Jews.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.560]   And we bear that in mind because there are certain aspects of the statement, as I hope
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.800]   to show you, that we cannot fully grasp unless we realize that they were spoken in particular
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.040]   to this learned and religious Jew.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.640]   Very well then, I say, we must bear all that in mind as we approach it once more.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.440]   Our Lord was anxious that Nicodemus, who had got such an entirely wrong notion as to the
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.160]   Messiah who was to come, should have the true idea, and that therefore he should realize
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.440]   who he was speaking to and what was the purpose of the coming of the Son of God into this
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.120]   world of time.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.880]   Now then, the great theme is the love of God as manifested in his Son and in the salvation
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   that the Son has made possible.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.800]   Now, last Sunday evening we spent our time in looking at what we may call the degree
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.240]   of the love.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   God so loved.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   Now that's the word, that's the expressive word, this word "so," and it's the content
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.000]   of that little word "so" that we are still interested in.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.800]   Last week it was the degree of God's love.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.960]   He so loved the world.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.480]   And we looked at the meaning of that phrase.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   What is the world?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:01.560]   Well, it is man in sin, man fallen away from God, man living a life outside God and all
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.360]   the glorious possibilities that God originally placed in men when he created him.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.120]   But God loved that, man in that condition, the world.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.960]   And not only that, we saw that he so loved it that he sent his only begotten Son into
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   such a world.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.520]   And we looked at something of what that must have meant both to the Son and to the Father.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   And then we ended on this note, and there is nothing which is so moving and so wonderful
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.480]   in the whole of Scripture as this.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.040]   God so loved the world that he gave.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.680]   He delivered him up for us all.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.800]   He delivered him up to all the endurance and the suffering and the agony that you and I
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.640]   so richly merit because of our sin and disobedience.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.800]   He bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.840]   It is by his stripes that we are healed.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.000]   He received the stripes.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   He suffered under them.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.560]   God gave him over to that.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.000]   And there you see something of the degree of God's love.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.120]   But now this evening I want to consider the manner of God's love, not the degree so much
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.640]   this evening as the manner of it.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.200]   And it's all still in this little word "so."
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   And it is, of course, defined by our Lord himself in certain words that are actually
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.680]   used by him in this particular verse.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   Now I regard this as a great privilege to hold before you the manner of God's love.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.800]   And I'm holding it before you this evening for two very special reasons.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.920]   I pray that God may look upon us and have mercy upon us all together and give me power
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.080]   to put this before you in a way that it shall be plain and clear to all who are listening
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.760]   to my voice at this moment.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.560]   Why do I feel this in an unusual manner?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.960]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:43.760]   We all of us are in a life in which we never know quite what's going to happen next.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.800]   And nothing is so important as we listen to the gospel as that we should listen to it
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.860]   with that in our minds.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.040]   You know, if all of us only realized the truth about life in this world, we should listen
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.680]   to this gospel in a very different manner.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.120]   The trouble with us all is, we're all guilty of it, that we tend to act on the assumption
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:16.600]   that we are here forever and that we can afford to listen to these things in a detached manner.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:24.000]   If only we saw ourselves as strangers and pilgrims and sojourners and journeymen, which
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.720]   is what we are, only during this past week.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.800]   I suddenly heard that a man whom I've known for some thirty-odd years, between thirty
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:45.240]   and thirty-five years, suddenly, while speaking in a meeting such as this, collapsed and died.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.600]   Ah, you say, but we're all familiar with that sort of thing.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.040]   Yes, I know we are so familiar with it that we forget it.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.720]   But you see, my friends, we are all in that kind of situation.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.320]   One disadvantage about a church like this is, and indeed it's a disadvantage about
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.360]   life in London altogether, that things like that are not brought home to us as they are
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.080]   in smaller communities.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.200]   If you happen to be living in a village and a man suddenly dies, well, you can't help
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   thinking about it.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.880]   Everybody talks about it.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's the one great topic of conversation for a week and longer.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.400]   It's there, it's held before you.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.280]   But here in London so many things happen.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.840]   We tend to forget these things.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.560]   It's a dangerous thing to live in a great city.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.400]   So I mention a fact like that to you in order that we all may remember that though we live
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:52.600]   in this great city of London, we are just human beings like everybody else, and that
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.320]   it's true of all of us to say, "Here today and gone tomorrow."
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.120]   The gospel addresses us in that way, as men and women who are here and are listening and
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.480]   have the opportunity, and it may be the last, and every man who preaches should preach in
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.160]   that way, as a dying man to dying men.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.040]   I say that as we listen to these gracious words uttered by the Son of God, that we may
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.640]   listen to them in that way.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:30.400]   And my second reason for calling your attention thus to them solemnly is this, that again
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.960]   very recently I've had abundant evidence that so many people stumble with respect to the
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.440]   Christian life just at this very point.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.720]   Now it's my privilege on Friday nights here in this church to be working through this
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.160]   epistle to the Romans, as you've been hearing.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:57.840]   And recently in doing so we have come to the apostles' great and mighty and moving statement
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.800]   of the doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.920]   And we've been going through it and trying to expound it.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   And to me it has been wonderful how God has used a service like that which one would have
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:22.040]   thought was primarily a teaching service as a means and an instrument of conversion and
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.000]   of bringing at least three people out of darkness into light, converting them, bringing them
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.120]   to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   Every time the gospel is presented it's an evangelistic service.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.000]   We've gone sadly astray, my friends, to think that only certain services in the church are
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   evangelistic.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Whenever this truth is expounded and preached it's evangelic.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.680]   And we expect conversions in every meeting.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.120]   These divisions are not scriptural.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.160]   And God has corrected our notions in that way by using such a service in bringing people
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.640]   to a knowledge of himself.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.120]   Yes, and through this very point with which we are dealing this evening, and others have
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:12.800]   spoken to me, how easy it is for us to miss this central point, this preliminary point
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   of the gospel.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.600]   "Very well, then," I say, "I want to try and put it to you tonight in as practical and as
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.440]   simple and as direct a manner as is possible."
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.000]   How does God manifest his love to us?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.560]   Well, the first thing I want to call attention to tonight is this.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.200]   He does so in what he gives to us.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.800]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   Why?
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:55.720]   "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.800]   That's what the gospel is about.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.440]   You see, Nicodemus had never realized that.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.120]   He thought that it was about miracles and about certain aspects of teaching and so on.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   It isn't.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.560]   The gospel includes all that, of course.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.360]   It's got a most amazing ethic.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.400]   It preaches the highest morality that has ever been held before men.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.480]   It's got its social application, its industrial application, its endless applications.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.080]   Yes, but my dear friend, if you spend your time with the applications and miss this,
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.760]   what a tragedy it is.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:38.440]   The great object and purpose is to give men everlasting or eternal life.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.240]   Now what is this?
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.080]   Had you realized that the gospel is offering you everlasting life, that the Son of God
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.800]   came into the world in order to give you that?
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.600]   Well, what is it?
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.320]   Well, as our Lord makes quite plain and clear here and in the previous verses, it is the
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.680]   opposite to perishing.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.840]   "You should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.600]   Now then, what does he mean by this?
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   What is perishing?
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:16.440]   Well, it's defined elsewhere in the Scriptures in this way.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.600]   It is to be dead in trespasses and in sins.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.840]   And a man who is dead in trespasses and sins is perishing.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.360]   And that is the condition of all men by nature.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.120]   That is how we are born into this world, perishing.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   What does it mean?
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   Well, it means this.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.720]   It means that we are outside the life of God.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.600]   And we are living a life which is entirely confined to the human and to the temporal
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.800]   level and sphere.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.680]   It means that instead of belonging to God, we belong to this world.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.280]   And we all know perfectly well what that means.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:15.000]   It means that our ideas are bounded by life in this world, bounded by the ideas and the
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.600]   thoughts and the capacities of man, and that we can never go outside that and never get
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   beyond that.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.760]   That's what to be perishing means.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.280]   Life you see is in God.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.600]   God alone hath immortality.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.440]   God alone hath life.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.000]   And apart from God there is no life.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.440]   That is why the Apostle Paul calls it "dead in trespasses and in sins."
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.920]   And that is man's state, I say, by nature.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.080]   And how evident it is that that is the condition of so many in this world this evening.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.400]   They are not alive to spiritual things at all.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.360]   They don't seem to realize that they've got a soul within them, something that is bigger
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:13.120]   than this world altogether, something that will go on when their body is dead and buried
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.080]   in a grave, something that is imperishable, something immaterial.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.600]   They never stop to think about that.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.840]   They're not interested in it.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   Why?
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   Well, because they're dead.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.840]   They're perishing.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.480]   They're spiritually dead.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:35.480]   And the only life they know, you see, is the life that belongs to the body.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.480]   That's their realm.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   That's their sphere.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.480]   And of course they're always talking about it and getting excited about it, spending
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.160]   their money and their time on it.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.440]   I needn't waste your time in telling you in detail what I mean.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.680]   We're all perfectly familiar with it.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.040]   You've simply got to read a newspaper or to listen to the wireless.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.280]   No, I'm not criticizing these things as such, but all I am saying is this.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.440]   Isn't it rather odd, isn't there something at any rate strange about this, that men are
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:14.760]   prepared to give such time and money and keenness and enthusiasm to things that belong only
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.040]   to the animal and the bodily and physical part of men, and none at all to the highest
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.040]   part of men?
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.400]   Well, that's to be perishing.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:33.320]   Not to be alive to and alert to the highest and the noblest and the most wonderful things,
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.560]   but to get so excited about the other.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.040]   Surely, it's a sign of death.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   It's a sign that we're in a perishing condition.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:51.600]   And I think you'll agree that that is the state of, alas, the majority of people in
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.160]   this country without going any further today.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:05.440]   Food, drink, clothing, games, sports, excitement.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.000]   Look at them by the thousands at their various football matches and the distances they'll
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.040]   travel, the way they'll talk about it before and afterwards and spend money, and the excitement
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   about it.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   All right, you say there's nothing wrong in a game of football.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.400]   I quite agree.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.680]   That isn't what I'm talking about.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   I'm not talking about the people who play football.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.080]   I'm talking about the people who get excited about it and just watching it and things of
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   that sort.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.320]   It's a very good thing to exercise your body.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:39.520]   But I'm talking about the whole personality living for that, or living for any one of
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:48.000]   these things that are purely on the animal and the physical level and plane, and having
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.960]   no interest at all, indeed despising this other kind of life in which one reminds oneself
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.600]   of this something within that links one to God and enjoys Him and His life.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:09.360]   But there it is, you see, that's perishing.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:19.760]   Not alive at all to the things of God, but living only and entirely bound and circumscribed
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:27.800]   by these things that belong not only to the body but to time and to this world.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:33.560]   And what makes it more tragic is this, that even as they're doing so, they're literally
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.440]   and physically dying.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.240]   Every day we live, we get older.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.000]   Every day we live, we are losing something in our faculties.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.600]   Now, this isn't to be morbid.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.840]   This is to face facts.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.400]   I believe in facing facts.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.600]   The gospel is not sob stuff.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.280]   The sob stuff is the talk that doesn't face the facts and tells you, "Leave it alone and
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.520]   let's go and have a good time."
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.040]   That's sob stuff, because it isn't honest.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.440]   It isn't facing facts.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.160]   I believe in facing facts.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.560]   And I therefore know that every one of us is getting older every single day.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.280]   And it can happen to you without your knowing it, you see.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.440]   And so a man who appears to be full of health and vigor and strength can suddenly drop dead.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.240]   He's never had that pain before.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.800]   His first attack killed him.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   Why?
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.440]   Well, there was a subtle process going on in his arteries.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.200]   He didn't know, nobody knew, but it was there.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.480]   And he's dying and he didn't know it.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.680]   And suddenly everybody knows that he's dead.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.080]   He's perishing.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:47.280]   And what is so terrifying, of course, and so awful is the message of the scripture that
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:56.760]   anybody who dies in that state and condition goes on like that through all eternity.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.120]   "I don't believe that hell is a place," says someone.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.080]   All right, my friend, I'm not asking you to believe that at the moment.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.280]   All I'm asking you to say is this.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.680]   Would you like to spend your eternity as you are now and even worse?
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.280]   Perishing.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.400]   No hope, no prospect.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.200]   Nothing to relieve it at all.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.520]   That is the condition of mankind now.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.840]   The love of God is seen in this.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:36.360]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:42.800]   should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   What's this?
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.160]   It's the exact opposite of all that I've been describing to you.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.760]   And this is the most amazing thing in the world tonight.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   What is it then?
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   Well, it's this.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.980]   The Apostle Paul puts it in these words, "Reckon yourselves therefore," he says to every Christian,
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:08.680]   "Reckon yourselves therefore to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God."
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   That's it.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.780]   That's what is meant by eternal life.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:20.400]   That one comes out of that condition of perishing and one begins to live in a real sense and
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.240]   in a spiritual sense.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:31.760]   Life always in the Bible means a participation in the life of God and that is Christianity.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.160]   I've often quoted this from this pulpit before.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:41.280]   A great Scotsman living some nearly three hundred years ago, he wrote a book with this
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   title.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.800]   His name was Henry Scougal.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.120]   The life of God in the souls of men.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.480]   That's eternal life.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.920]   That's Christianity.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.920]   That is Christianity.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.760]   Christianity, you see, is not just morality.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   It isn't just goodness.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.360]   It isn't just doing certain things and not doing others.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.880]   It includes that but it goes beyond that.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:09.800]   The real heart and core and center of Christianity is the life of God in a man's soul.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   Eternal life.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   Very well, then, you see, we must define this term, eternal or everlasting life, in this
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.120]   twofold way.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.040]   It first of all means a quality of life.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.580]   It's a particular quality of life.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:35.080]   It means, in other words, that we are made spiritually alive.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.560]   It means that whereas a man had always been living in the way that I've been depicting,
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:48.600]   suddenly he awakens to the fact that "dust thou art, to dust returnest" was not spoken
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.920]   of the soul.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.280]   He's aware of the fact that there's something in him that is bigger than all this physical,
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.400]   all this material and earthly.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   There is this immaterial, invisible something that is a part of him and it's the greatest
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   part of him.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.840]   He begins to awaken to that and he says, "I've never considered it.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.120]   I've never thought about it.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.400]   I've done nothing about it.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.800]   I've been neglecting the most priceless thing of all."
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.240]   But now he's made alive, spiritually alert.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.880]   He awakens.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:29.680]   And so he begins to think about God.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.720]   You see, the way to measure life or any view of life is just this.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.520]   How does one spend it?
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.160]   What is it one does with one's activities?
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:52.080]   Now I put it to you as a simple question, a reasonable question.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.880]   Which is the greater when you come to assess and to measure?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:07.000]   To be thinking upon the mere use of the body in various ways or to be thinking about God,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:17.480]   the Lord God Almighty, the everlasting and the eternal, and my relationship to him?
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:24.560]   Thinking of men in the context of God and of eternity and of all that is glorious and
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.880]   wonderful, that's the thing that happens to the men who is given eternal or everlasting
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   life.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:37.720]   They are spiritually awake, and he now begins to think along this line.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.480]   You see, our Lord himself on one occasion, it's in the seventeenth chapter of this Gospel,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.680]   according to St. John, the third verse, said this.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:58.000]   He said, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.200]   Christ whom thou hast sent."
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.800]   Now that's the thing that is given to us by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, knowing
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:16.440]   God, knowing God's love to us, knowing God's care for us, his solicitude with respect to
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:23.480]   us, so that you see when you find yourself suddenly stricken by an illness and no longer
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:29.160]   able to follow your usual profession or business or whatever it was, and no longer able to
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.520]   go after your excitements and your interests and your pleasure, suddenly all that is stopped,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.400]   and you're lying helpless and you're back in bed and left to yourself, and you don't
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.080]   know what to do with yourself.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:51.000]   Ah, before you were wretched and miserable and disconsolate, but now you are not alone.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.040]   You know that God is with you, and he manifests himself to you.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.640]   And indeed, you may find yourself even thanking God for an illness.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.120]   You may say with the psalmist of old, "It was good for me that I have been afflicted,
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.920]   because before I was afflicted I went astray."
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:18.440]   But now he's come back and he's enjoying a life of communion with God, and he knows that
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:25.280]   God will never leave him nor forsake him, and other things that follow are these.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   He begins to experience a peace and a joy that he'd never known before.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.920]   Isn't it difficult to find peace in this world, the world with its rush and its bustle and
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.560]   its noise and its clatter?
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.400]   Oh, where can one find peace and rest and quiet?
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.040]   Here it is as a part of everlasting life.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.040]   And joy.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.200]   "Joy I give unto you," said the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.320]   "My joy give I unto you."
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.000]   Indeed, I can sum it up, therefore, by putting it like this.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:15.880]   To have eternal life means that we become the possessors of exactly the same life as
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.640]   the Son of God himself had when he was in this world.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.040]   Read these four Gospels for yourself.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.600]   Look at his life.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.200]   Everybody admires that life.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:33.920]   Had you realized, my friend, that that very type of life, that quality, that kind of life
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.780]   is offered to you by Christ himself?
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.280]   You and I can share his life.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:46.880]   We can have the life of Christ within us, and we can go through this world exactly as
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:54.360]   he went through it, living above it, living on a higher plane and on a higher level, knowing
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.800]   a peace that nothing could disturb, knowing a joy that even the cross could not rob him
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   of.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   That's the quality of life.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.820]   But eternal life is not only a quality of life, it's also got the element of quantity
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.240]   in it.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.160]   And you notice that there is a difference here.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.600]   In the fifteenth verse I read, "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   eternal life."
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.440]   Here it is translated, "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.600]   life."
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:53.380]   And I want to emphasize that.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.240]   It's merely the foretaste.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.920]   You know the farmers in ancient times, when the crop had become ripened, they used to
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.760]   go and reap just a little.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.960]   That was called the first fruits, the first pickings, if you like, from the apple tree,
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.600]   the first apple that has become—you take just that one and you eat it and you say,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.280]   "Isn't it marvelous?" and see the crop that's coming.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.800]   The first fruits, the foretaste.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.520]   That's all we are given here.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.520]   It's marvelous.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.760]   It's wonderful.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:33.480]   But after death we go on and receive it in all its fullness and in all its glory.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.440]   That is everlasting life.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.040]   God puts his life into our souls here.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:44.000]   It lasts through life, it lasts through death, and it goes on lasting throughout eternity
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.040]   itself.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:58.520]   And that is the prospect, as our Lord puts it here, "for every one that believeth on
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.120]   his name."
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   That is the gift.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.280]   Oh, isn't this an amazing love?
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.240]   The love of God to men is as great as this.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.280]   This is its mode.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:13.640]   This is its method, that it comes to rebels and sinners who are dead and perishing and
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:19.520]   gives them life, God's life.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.920]   Where do you realize that you might begin to enjoy the life of God in your soul in this
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.520]   present world?
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.640]   That's the very message of the gospel.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.320]   But come, let me note the second thing.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.520]   Notice the way in which God gives it.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   How does God give this life?
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.800]   Now here is the thing that must have astounded Nicodemus.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:47.520]   Nicodemus, you see, as a Jew and as a Pharisee, believed that God rewarded men for the good
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.280]   life they lived and for their prayers and for all their religion and so on.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.920]   They say, "If I do this much, then God will give me the reward."
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.440]   The Apostle Paul once believed that doctrine, as he tells us in writing to the Philippians.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:08.400]   He was proud of his own life, his own godliness and religion and all his efforts, and he believed
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.480]   God would reward him, that he could even put in his bill, as it were, and ask for the reward.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:19.440]   That's the natural man's view, if he believes in God at all.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.080]   But do you notice what the Lord Jesus Christ said to Nicodemus?
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:33.320]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.200]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.920]   Now this is the thing I'm anxious to make so plain and clear.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:52.720]   You receive this gift of eternal life, you receive salvation, entirely and only and utterly
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.800]   as a gift from God.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.040]   It is the result only of believing on him, of faith in him.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.600]   You do nothing at all for it.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.160]   It isn't the result of your good works.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.420]   It isn't the result of your good life.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:12.080]   It isn't the result of your efforts, your striving, or any of your achievements.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.920]   That has got nothing to do with it.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:23.120]   It is entirely the result of believing in the name of the Son of God.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.040]   It is here, I say, that men will persist in going astray.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   There is no greater fallacy than to think that you can make yourself a Christian.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.200]   No man has ever made himself a Christian.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.160]   No man ever will make himself a Christian.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.400]   Indeed, I go so far as to say this, the man who thinks that he has made himself a Christian
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:55.400]   is proving and asserting that he is not a Christian, for it is an impossibility.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.960]   And there is nothing that so prevents men from becoming Christians as their own efforts
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.640]   to make themselves Christians.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.960]   It simply cannot be done.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.880]   Now the history of the Church is strewn with evidence about this.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:18.640]   Wasn't that the whole trouble with Martin Luther before his conversion?
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   He was trying to make himself a Christian, and he realized it was a tremendous task.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   He became a monk.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.360]   He turned his back upon the world and upon prospects in a profession, and he went into
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:36.680]   a cell, and there he is fasting and sweating and praying and doing good.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   What is he trying to do?
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.920]   He is trying to make himself a Christian, trying to work up a righteousness that will
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.520]   satisfy God.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.960]   And God looking on him will say, "Well done, Martin Luther.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   You have done so well.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.560]   I give you the gift of eternal life as a reward."
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:59.280]   And then his eyes were suddenly opened, and he saw that it was tragically wrong, and he
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:06.600]   turned right about, and he saw that that was the way to hell, and that there was only one
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:15.160]   way to God and to heaven, and that was this way of faith, "The just shall live by faith."
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   What does it mean?
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.280]   Well, let me put it simply like this.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:27.160]   What obtains this gift of eternal life is that a man believes in him.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:34.000]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.920]   him should not perish.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   What does it mean?
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   It means this.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.840]   Our Lord has already been expounding it to Nicodemus.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.120]   It means that you must believe in his person.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:55.560]   It means that you accept this scriptural testimony and evidence that Jesus of Nazareth was none
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:02.640]   other than the eternal Son of God, the only begotten Son of God.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:09.280]   It just means that you believe this record, that at that given point in time, which happened
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:16.360]   when you turned from B.C. to A.D., that the Son of God came out of heaven and was born
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.800]   of the virgin's womb.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:23.280]   You believe that, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:30.800]   You believe this statement, that that person who appeared to be just a man and who worked
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.400]   as a carpenter in Nazareth for all those silent years was none other than the everlasting
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.640]   Word through whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made that is made,
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.080]   the person of the Son of God.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.240]   You believe on him?
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:55.560]   Yes, but not only his person but his work.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   You believe that he came into this world in order to save men from perishing, that he
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.120]   didn't come into the world just to give us a moral teaching, just to give us an example
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.440]   and a philip to our efforts and endeavors.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.600]   No, no.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.040]   You believe him when he says, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   is lost."
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.240]   "The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.480]   a ransom for many."
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.620]   You believe that.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:35.760]   Now believing on him means that, and you must put that into the content.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.960]   In other words, it means this.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.800]   If you say truly that you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, what you're saying can be put
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.920]   in these terms.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.840]   I see that I am a sinner.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.560]   I see that I'm perishing.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.560]   I see that I'm outside the life of God.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.840]   I see that all my goodness about which I've bursted so much is but as filthy rags or what
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:09.080]   the apostle Paul calls dung, refuse, manure, foul.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:17.720]   I see that I can never put myself right, and I see and believe that the Son of God came
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:23.000]   from heaven to earth in order to save me.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.960]   I believe that he took my sins upon himself and bore their punishment, that he has done
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.000]   this for me that none other could do but that he has done it.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.440]   Now that is what believing in him means, but I want to emphasize the believing aspect.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.080]   What does that mean?
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:49.920]   Well obviously it must mean in the first instance recognition of the truth.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.400]   Did you notice that interesting statement that was made about that woman Lydia, a seller
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.680]   of purple from Thyatira who lived in the city of Philippi?
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.800]   The apostle Paul and his companions went and sat down amongst those women in the prayer
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.960]   meeting and the apostle began to speak unto them the word of the Lord.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.600]   And do you remember what happened?
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:16.880]   Whose heart we are told the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things that were spoken
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.500]   of Paul, attended unto them.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:26.160]   She did that for the first time in her life, you see, paid attention to.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.120]   Where then, here is the first thing always in belief.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.080]   You may have had an open Bible in your possession all your life, it was in your home, you may
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.960]   have read it when you were a child, you've heard it read in chapel or in church wherever
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   you go.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.200]   "Ah," you say, "I've always been familiar with that, but that isn't what I'm asking."
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.680]   Have you attended unto it?
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.120]   Have you said, "This word is speaking to me?
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.560]   When I read what our Lord said to Nicodemus, I'm reading what he says to me."
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.800]   This isn't simply about people who lived two thousand years ago, it's about people still,
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.240]   it's about men always.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.120]   This word is speaking to me.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.880]   How can it be that I've lived all these years and I've never attended unto it?
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.160]   "Ah, I've said I know that, but I've never paid attention, I've never concentrated, I've
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.840]   never said, 'What does this mean, what's it saying?'"
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   Attended unto it.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.480]   Have you attended unto this word?
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.160]   You can't believe it without attending unto it.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.760]   You can't take it for granted.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.080]   You've got to pay attention.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:33.720]   The next step is accepting it, accepting it with your mind.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.600]   But you know, believing goes a step further than that.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   It means that you begin to trust it, that you have confidence in him and in what he's
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.840]   done for you.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:52.320]   Indeed, I can define believing on the Lord Jesus Christ like this.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:41:03.680]   It means resting yourself and your soul and your eternal destiny entirely in him and upon
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.000]   him.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.160]   I can therefore test you very easily at this moment as to whether you believe in the Lord
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   Jesus Christ or not.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.640]   This is the test.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.400]   Are you still looking to yourself in any way?
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.480]   Are you still looking to yourself in any way?
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.880]   Are you still saying, "Ah, yes, I'm now going to decide that henceforward I'm going to do
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.600]   this or that."
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.960]   If you speak like that, you don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:41.920]   To believe in the Lord Jesus Christ means that you are finished with yourself and your
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.220]   own efforts once and forever.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.760]   That you say, "I see it clearly that it doesn't matter what I do, it doesn't matter how long
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.000]   I may go on doing it, I can never do enough.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.960]   Therefore, I'm not going to rely on myself and my activities anymore.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.560]   I am now going to rely entirely on him and what he has done for me."
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.440]   That is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.500]   So that I've got a further test.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.640]   It is something that once you see it, you do at once.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.840]   You don't say, "No, I'm going to."
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.920]   What's the point of saying, "I'm going to"?
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.720]   Why not do it now?
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.640]   What can you do by waiting?
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.520]   What difference is it going to make though you may wait for twenty-four hours?
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.000]   What can you do between now and this time tomorrow night that's going to make a difference
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.480]   to your relationship to God?
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   No, no.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.720]   The moment a man believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, he says, "I do it now.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.240]   I don't wait for a second.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.920]   I want nothing more.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.120]   Nothing else can make a difference.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.280]   I take him now."
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.080]   There is an immediacy about belief.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:53.960]   Didn't that come out in the story that I read to you about the Philippian jailer?
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.760]   The Philippian jailer, you know, didn't have to undergo a course of instruction before
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.480]   he became a Christian.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.620]   He had the Word preached to him and he believed him.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.520]   He believed Paul and Silas and he was baptized and he rejoiced.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.160]   There and then, in the middle of the night, it happened.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.920]   This thing happens at once.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.200]   If you see it, there's no point in delaying.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.640]   You say at once, "I can trust him now as well as tomorrow," or in a thousand years'
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.560]   time, "Nothing makes any difference.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.800]   I believe now."
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.000]   You'll never qualify for this.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.440]   You'll never be any better or any more qualified than you are now.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.360]   Belief is immediate.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.760]   To see the truth is to accept it and to trust it.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.520]   I even go further and say, "Don't worry about your feelings for the moment.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.080]   Don't worry about your assurance for the moment."
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.080]   Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ is accepting his testimony, setting your seal to it that
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.120]   the Word is true, saying, "If I don't believe it, I'm making him a liar.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.200]   I don't understand, but I believe."
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.440]   I say, "When he spoke to Nicodemus, he's speaking to me, and he tells me this.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.840]   I believe him.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.960]   I'll trust my all, my everything to him."
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:16.520]   Oh, what a wonderful love this is, that God gives us this gift of everlasting life, his
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.360]   own life, in that way.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.680]   Nothing in my hands I bring; simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.160]   Naked, come to thee for dress helpless; look to thee for grace.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   Foul, I to the fountain fly.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.840]   Wash me, Savior, or I die.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.960]   Believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.480]   There it is.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   Have you done it?
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.840]   Can't you see that it thus puts you at once into this position, that without a second's
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   delay, without waiting to rid your soul of one dark blot, you come to him just as you
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:03.960]   are, and believe him when he tells you that he can wash you and make you whiter than snow.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:09.160]   My last word is on the other word which is here and in which you see again the love of
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.760]   God so gloriously, the word "whosoever."
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.400]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.480]   should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:32.640]   Don't forget that this was spoken to Nicodemus, who thought that Jews only were to be saved
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.360]   and that all Gentiles were to be condemned.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.480]   "No, no," says our Lord, "you are quite wrong.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.120]   It is for Gentiles as well as Jews.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:49.200]   It is for all who believe, whosoever they are, from any nation or tribe or language.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.840]   Doesn't matter whether you are British or African, Japanese, Chinese, South American.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.120]   All this nonsense is demolished here.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   We are all human.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.960]   We are all in sin.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:06.520]   Whosoever believeth."
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.920]   But I do want to apply it like this.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:16.520]   There is a verse which seems to me to sum it all up, and I quote it to you as I close.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:25.320]   "Today thy mercy calls me to wash away my sin."
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:31.640]   Listen, "However great my trespass."
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   Have you got that?
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:43.080]   "Today, now, thy mercy calls me to wash away my sin.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.720]   However great my trespass."
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.160]   There is no limit to that.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.880]   Have you understood this, my friend?
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.920]   It doesn't matter what you have been, it doesn't matter what you have done.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   People say to me, "If you but knew the life I have lived, if you knew the sins I have
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.920]   committed."
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.520]   To which I always reply this.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.240]   I say, "I am not at all interested in your sins.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.800]   I don't care what you have done or what you have been.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.600]   We are all sinners.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.200]   It is we, you see, who draw these distinctions between big sins and little sins.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.160]   God doesn't.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:30.760]   One sin is as bad as another in the sight of God, and it damns the soul as much as another."
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.720]   It is quite an immaterial thing to the preacher of the gospel, whether you have committed
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.440]   murder or not.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:43.040]   If you are a murderer, you have got the same chance here as anybody else.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.560]   So put everything you like into that.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:56.440]   Put murder and drunkenness, put adultery and immorality and vice, put the foulest, most
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.880]   fiendish, the most perverted, horrible things beyond description and imagination, put them
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:07.400]   all in, however great my trespass.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:13.480]   Whatever I may have been, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:23.240]   Listen, "However long from mercy I may have turned away."
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.120]   It doesn't matter at all.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:31.620]   You perhaps have been reading the books of the psychologists, in which they say that
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.360]   if you are not converted in your adolescence stage, you never will be.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   Nonsense.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.840]   "However long from mercy I may have turned away."
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   It doesn't matter.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:49.520]   I don't care how old you are.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.840]   Forgive me for repeating something I have often said before.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.240]   I will let you into the secret of the essential difference between the life of a doctor and
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.960]   the life of a preacher and evangelist.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:08.560]   In the case of the doctor handling people, he is very concerned about the history.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.240]   He wants to know their past history, about the father and the mother, what they died
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   of.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   He must have his history.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.240]   He can't do anything about it.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.640]   Do you know, I am not interested in histories here.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:24.400]   That's why I am not interested in these testimonies, people describing the sins they
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.640]   committed and so on.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:32.280]   It is a waste of time because everybody is a sinner and everybody needs the same salvation.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.840]   The particular sins you committed don't matter at all and it doesn't matter what
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.640]   you were, whether you were an admiral or a journalist or a crossing sweeper.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   What does it matter?
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   You are a soul.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.080]   You are a human being.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.000]   No one case is any more wonderful than another.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.280]   Every one is a miracle and it is God alone who could do it.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:55.320]   Why pay attention to men, therefore?
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:01.360]   You may be an octogenarian trembling at the brink of your grave or you may be only eight
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   years old.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:14.680]   However long from mercy we may have turned away, thy blood, O Christ, can cleanse me
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.320]   and make me white.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:21.280]   Today, there it is then, I say.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.800]   There is no hindrance, no obstacle that you can think of.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.520]   The only thing that matters is do you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.560]   Every objection is answered.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.500]   Every obstacle is moved.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:41.160]   If you really see this and believe what he says, you can believe it now and know that
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:48.200]   your sins are forgiven, that you are not perishing any longer, but that you have received everlasting
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.280]   life.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.880]   Have you done so?
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.680]   Do so now.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.400]   If you begin to say, "Ah, but," you haven't seen it.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.460]   You haven't seen the truth.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.840]   You haven't attended it until you don't believe him.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:07.600]   If you believe what he says, every but is withdrawn.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.960]   Nothing matters.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:19.440]   I just go to him as I am and acknowledge and confess my sin, that I deserve hell and eternal
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:26.440]   punishment because of my folly and arrogance and sin, but that I believe that because of
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.760]   what he, the Son of God, has done for me.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.680]   It's all cancelled.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:40.200]   And I, from this moment, become a child of God and an heir of that eternal bliss with
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   the Father.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.920]   I do it now.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   And if you don't do it now, you haven't believed.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.600]   If you have believed, you'll do it at once.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.960]   I therefore leave it with you.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:52:09.800]   Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life, which is life indeed.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.920]   Amen.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:19.520]   If you have believed and have never done so before, confess your sin to him now and tell
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.600]   him that you believe and cast yourself upon his love and mercy.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:34.840]   Do so now.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:43.160]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:50.960]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:59.840]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:10.240]   shall be with him in glory and sharing his eternal life without end.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.200]   Amen.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
