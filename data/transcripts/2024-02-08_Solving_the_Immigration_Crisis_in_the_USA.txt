[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.000]   >> Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.240]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.480]   Today on the show, I want to talk about something with you that is going to sound more political.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.760]   It does have personal finance implications and impact. The basic concept that I'm going
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.040]   to drive at from a personal finance perspective is that as you build wealth, your sense of security
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.600]   and your actual security of your person, your effects, etc., your home, these are fundamental
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.240]   things. As somebody builds wealth, one of the first things that they will do in applying this
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.680]   wealth is to move from an unsafe neighborhood to a safe neighborhood because security is of primary
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.720]   importance, and this is a good use of money. That's the personal finance angle that I'm going
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.880]   to use to tie this into appropriate content for Radical Personal Finance, but I do confess up here
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.200]   and up front that this episode, that that connection is looser than I usually will permit,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.280]   and that's because this episode is coming from a request from a listener. A listener writes in and
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.240]   sends me a couple of articles, which I'm going to read to you and comment on, and asks for my
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.120]   commentary on this subject, specifically regarding immigration. We see in the United States significant
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.640]   issues regarding immigration, an enormous battle taking place. The listener wrote to me and talked
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.320]   about the arguments between Texas Governor Abbott and the Biden administration about the ability and
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   the right of the Texas Guard to secure the border with Mexico by placing barriers to stop the flow
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.680]   of immigration. We see immigration as a primary political topic all across Europe, all across the
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   world, etc. And so I feel justified in talking about it today with you, and I think that those
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.560]   of you who are interested in thoughtful, nuanced discussion on difficult topics will enjoy this
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.200]   show. However, those of you who are looking for just standard kind of personal finance fare,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.560]   you'll want to skip this episode and move to a different one because there'll be more of just
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.920]   kind of basic nuts and bolts of finance. The other reason I'm doing this is that I've been
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.600]   buried in finishing up my consulting appointments and also preparing for a new live event, which I'll
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.200]   be announcing hopefully in the next day or two. And I can do this topic fairly straight off the
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   cuff, ready to go without a ton of preparation. It's been over a week since I've been on the
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.360]   microphone. So let's begin with this. I'm going to begin by reading the article that my listener
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.680]   wrote to me about and asked me to comment on. And this article was written in 2014 by now dead Gary
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.560]   North. The article is called "Immigration Control, Federal Social Engineering." I'm going to read the
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.440]   article without comment and then come back and comment upon it. "Central planning by the federal
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.120]   government is officially opposed by conservatives until you show them a marker that says 'United
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.880]   States' on one side and 'Mexico' on the other. Then, 'Congress needs to build a fence.' The
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.080]   believers in fences offer many arguments. Some of them say this, 'Those people want to get free
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.320]   government welfare. We cannot afford it.' The defender of liberty replies in two ways. First,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.040]   these programs should be abolished. They are based on government planning and coercive wealth
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.520]   redistribution. They are the main problem, not any immigrants who may sign up. Second, the sooner
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.360]   they go bankrupt, the better. Let immigrants sign up. The problem is this. Most conservatives approve
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   of these welfare programs in theory and practice. The big ones are Social Security, Medicare, and
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.200]   tax-funded education. Conservatives do not want these programs defunded. They see them as part
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.440]   of the American way of life. Second, the conservative says this, 'These immigrants will
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.160]   undermine our social way of life. They're just too different. The American way of life cannot
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.400]   survive open immigration. Change will overwhelm the American way of life.' The defender of liberty
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.720]   responds, 'The free market changes America every day. Innovations undermine our way of life moment
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.560]   by moment. Innovation makes our lives better.' Second, he replies, 'Why do you think Congress
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.320]   can pass a law restricting freedom of travel and freedom of contract and thereby preserve the good
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.200]   parts of our way of life? Why do you trust the federal government's good judgment in matters
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.280]   social and economic? Why have you become an apologist for central planning? Why have you
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.840]   become an advocate of social engineering by federal politicians and bureaucrats?'
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.160]   Conservatives remain silent. They have never thought of this, and they don't want to have
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.680]   to rethink what they say they believe in, namely that Congress cannot safely be trusted on matters
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.440]   economic. They are saying that Congress can provide a Goldilocks solution. Not too much
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   social change, but not too little. The defender of liberty asks, 'When has Congress ever legislated
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.520]   a Goldilocks solution? When has the federal bureaucracy ever enforced it as written,
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.840]   let alone as justified by members of the voting bloc in Congress that passed it?'
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.680]   Third, the conservative says this, 'Immigrants will get jobs here. They'll take jobs away from
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.120]   Americans.' I want to focus on this argument, for it is the most common one. It invokes nationalism
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.320]   over liberty. It equates nationalism with restrictions on the freedom of contract.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.800]   It says, 'Not everyone should have the legal right to bid on jobs inside our borders.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.360]   Only those who are legally inside our borders already, or who will be born to those already
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.880]   inside our borders, should possess this right.' It says, 'Our ancestors got here before there were
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.040]   any immigration laws. We deserve the right to bid. Outsiders don't. It's first come, first served.'
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:32.680]   May we help? This attitude is in direct opposition to both Christianity and the free market. A
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.840]   fundamental principle of Christianity is the principle of 'service to God by service to
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.560]   our fellow men.' This is made clear in Matthew 25, 'Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.320]   done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' Verse 40.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.120]   The context is the final judgment. The principle of service is also basic to free market economics,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.600]   which teaches that income derives from service to the customer. This goes back to Adam Smith in
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.800]   The Wealth of Nations, 1776. "But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren,
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.920]   and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.360]   prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favor, and show them that it is for their own
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.040]   advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.960]   proposes to do this. 'Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want,' is the
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.320]   meaning of every such offer. And it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.040]   greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.080]   butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.520]   interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.880]   chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens." The fundamental economic principle
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.200]   of immigration control is that service must be made illegal in order to protect the above-market
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.520]   incomes of producers inside a nation's borders, thereby reducing the availability of services to
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:29.320]   customers inside the borders. The job holders form a cartel with a goal to keep out competitors,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.920]   thereby keeping their wages above market. The job holders prevail on Congress to post this sign
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:43.000]   facing outward on the border, "No. Help. Wanted." Not wanted by whom? By members of the job holder's
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.280]   cartel. It is now illegal for customers to post this sign, "Help. Wanted." The earliest manifestation
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.440]   of this mindset in America was the retailers' hostility to Chinese immigrants in California.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.560]   It started with the Gold Rush of 1849, the year after the federal government completed President
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.240]   Polk's theft of one-third of Mexico, which included California. Chinese workers worked
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:13.560]   long hours at far lower wages. They were price-competitive. This hostility by retailers
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.240]   got worse over the next quarter century. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.800]   example of a federal law excluding specific nationals. It was not repealed until 1943,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:32.200]   when China was an ally in the Pacific War. The president who signed the 1882 bill into law
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.120]   was by far the most appropriate president in American history to have done so, Chester Arthur.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.200]   Before becoming vice president, and then president after the assassination of Garfield, Arthur had
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.880]   been the head of the Port of New York, the government's most lucrative customs house.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.400]   It was known at the time as being a major source of political kickbacks to the Republican Party.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.160]   The stink got so bad that President Hayes removed Arthur from the position.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:06.680]   We are not taught the following in history courses. Not until 1948 was it legal in California for
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.840]   whites or blacks to marry Asians. The California State Supreme Court overturned the law. The vote
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   was four to three. That was the first state to overturn laws against interracial marriage,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:25.560]   by one vote. We look back and we are amazed. Why would anyone have believed that state politicians
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.400]   had the wisdom to assess accurately the collective social benefits and liabilities of interracial
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:38.040]   marriages? This was social engineering by state politicians. Most conservatives today,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:45.800]   but not in 1947, reject such a suggestion. Yet most conservatives believe today that federal
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.120]   bureaucrats can be trusted with this same power with respect to immigration. Conservatives quote
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.720]   Ronald Reagan, quote, "A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation." Conclusion,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:08.600]   from 1788 to 1882, the United States was not a nation. Silly, isn't it? Then why do conservatives
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.080]   quote it? This historically silly slogan assumes that passing a law is the same as achieving the
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   law's official goal. We have immigration laws on the statute books today. We also have 10 million
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.520]   illegal aliens, maybe 20 million, maybe 30 million. The government cannot even count them.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.760]   It would cost at least $23,000 each to deport them. Each case must be tried in a court. It
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:40.040]   would tie up the US court system. They cannot, will not, be deported. Fact, the USA does not
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   control its borders. This control is only symbolic, a token to placate the voters.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:53.720]   Are we therefore a token nation? Should we trust social engineering by politicians? Why?
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.520]   Borders, badges, and guns. A brief history.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:05.160]   Federal restrictions on immigration in 1917 applied to various kinds of social behavior.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:12.120]   But immigration restrictions from 1882 up until World War I mainly had to do with keeping Chinese
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.240]   out of the country. The Immigration Act of 1924 extended this to many nations.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:24.040]   Wikipedia summarizes, quote, "The Immigration Act of 1924, or Johnson-Reed Act, including the
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:31.160]   National Origins Act and Asian Exclusion Act, enacted May 26, 1924, was the United States
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.840]   federal law that limited the annual number of immigrants who could be admitted from any country
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.200]   to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States in
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.320]   1890, down from the 3% cap set by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1921, according to the Census
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:54.200]   of 1890. It superseded the 1921 Emergency Quota Act. The law was primarily aimed at further
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.640]   restricting immigration of Southern Europeans, Eastern Europeans. In addition, it severely
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.920]   restricted the immigration of Africans and prohibited the immigration of Arabs, East Asians,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.960]   and Indians. According to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, the purpose of the
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:17.160]   act was, quote, "to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity. Congressional opposition was minimal."
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:23.800]   End of Wikipedia quote. The tradition of immigration control lasted from 1924 to 1968,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.200]   when Teddy Kennedy's Immigration Act of 1965 was signed into law by Lyndon Johnson. A sign of
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:38.440]   freedom prior to World War I was this. There were no passports anywhere in the West. Wikipedia says,
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.040]   quote, "A rapid expansion of rail travel and wealth in Europe beginning in the mid-19th century
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.360]   led to a unique dilution of the passport system for approximately 30 years prior to World War I.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   The speed of trains, as well as the number of passengers that crossed multiple borders,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.400]   made enforcement of passport laws difficult. The general reaction was the relaxation of
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.600]   passport requirements. In the later part of the 19th century and up to World War I,
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.960]   passports were not required, on the whole, for travel within Europe, and crossing a border was
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:15.560]   a relatively straightforward procedure. Consequently, comparatively few people held passports.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.360]   During World War I, European governments introduced border passport requirements for
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.040]   security reasons and to control the emigration of citizens with useful skills. These controls
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.000]   remained in place after the war, becoming standard, though controversial, procedure.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.360]   British tourists of the 1920s complained, especially about attached photographs
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.560]   and physical descriptions, which they considered led to a, quote, "nasty dehumanization."
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:49.160]   End of quote and end of Wikipedia quote. "Your papers, please." World War I brought us that
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:57.480]   grim phrase. The conservative tradition in America, 1788 to 1882, was open borders.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.280]   So was the liberal tradition. The constitutional tradition in America was open borders. Only in
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:10.760]   1882 did this begin to change. It escalated in 1924. If you listen to the proponents of
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.600]   immigration restriction today, you would think that George Washington and James Madison in 1787
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.880]   persuaded the Constitutional Convention to authorize congressional restrictions on immigration.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.720]   You would think that this was part of the American constitutional tradition,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.680]   but the U.S. Constitution has no reference to any such restrictions.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:38.360]   Anytime somebody says that there have to be some sort of social criteria beyond non-criminal
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.720]   judicial status in order to gain residence in the United States, he is saying that politicians
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.640]   in Congress and permanent tenured bureaucrats in the executive are competent in understanding what
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.640]   America needs today and what America will need in the future. Conservatives don't believe this
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:02.440]   in many areas of life, but with respect to two things, imported goods and imported people,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.960]   they believe that Congress knows better and the tenured executive bureaucracy knows best.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.000]   This is the default mode of thinking for most conservatives. They believe with all their
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.280]   hearts that Congress can be trusted and tenured executive bureaucrats protected by civil service
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.720]   laws are in effect a kind of priesthood. These people know what America needs.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:30.920]   Why should anyone believe this? Hispanics are going to break up America. Recently,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.480]   I was sent this email, "It's true that for much, perhaps even most of our history,
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.920]   we had practically no immigration restrictions at all. We also had a nation consisting of a
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.560]   landmass begging for inhabitants, workers, farmers, inventors, educators, etc. But we insisted,
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.440]   if not legally, then as a practical matter, that these new arrivals learned our language,
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.040]   conformed to our laws, and consider themselves citizens of their adopted nation."
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:05.720]   Who were "we"? How did "we" do this? By letting people alone, judicially speaking.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.880]   The federal government said nothing. The federal government was not regarded as having any say
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:16.120]   in the matter. Continuing now the quoted letter, "A few could not and sometimes returned to the
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.400]   old country, but most stayed and became passionately loyal Americans. What's profoundly
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.800]   disturbing is that many of the new arrivals, particularly the Hispanics, appear to have
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.400]   little or no intention of assimilating, and in some cases of even learning or using our language.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.760]   If continued, this will become a surefire formula for societal disaster, most likely in the form of
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:44.280]   the country simply breaking up, just as did the seemingly impregnable old USSR. I'd bet more than
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.760]   even odds that this will happen in the fairly near future. Once it starts, it'll proceed with
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:55.880]   the speed of a massive seismic shift." End quote of the letter. What the author of the letter did
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.240]   not say is the following, "I trust the Congress of the United States and the permanent civil
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.280]   service bureaucracy employed by the executive to make decisions regarding social stability
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:12.520]   in the United States today and in the future." If he had been willing to do this, I would have
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.120]   acknowledged that at least he had thought through the implications of his position.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:22.360]   At least he was willing to say what is implied by his view of immigration. He believes in
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:28.280]   congressional social engineering with respect to immigration. He also believes that the federal
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.520]   bureaucrats have both the ability and the moral responsibility to make decisions about who should
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:41.160]   live here and under what circumstances. He is saying, inevitably, that federal bureaucrats
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.480]   have the ability to make accurate social forecasts about how specific non-criminal
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.640]   and physically healthy immigrants are going to affect American society in the future.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:58.360]   I do not share his faith. He doesn't trust Hispanics. He thinks Hispanics are going to
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.520]   speak Spanish all their lives. He thinks they won't integrate into the country.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.880]   Where is the evidence that Hispanic kids who were born in this country, and who have attended public
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.600]   schools, and who watch American television and listen to rap music cannot speak English?
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.200]   They can even speak rap. I don't speak rap. I cannot understand what those people are saying.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   But Hispanic teenagers are fluent in rap. I guess we can call them trilingual.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   I don't notice that Hispanics riot very often. People in La Raza march in groups carrying
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.680]   placards with slogans, but they're smart enough to have the slogans in English for the television
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.840]   evening news. The fact that Hispanic parents, some of whom do not speak English, demanded and
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:46.680]   got their own high school in Los Angeles, right next door to all-black Jefferson High, should
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.360]   come as a surprise, only in this sense. The school board voted for this. That the parents demanded a
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:58.680]   dress code is also no surprise. It is called Nava College Preparatory Academy. All the students
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:07.000]   speak English. Most of them speak rap. Most immigrants who came from Eastern Europe and
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.440]   Central Europe in the late 19th century and the early 20th century could not speak English. We
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.040]   don't know what percentage of them learned to speak English, but there were whole sections of
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.280]   New York City in 1900 that spoke Yiddish and other Central European languages. But the children
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.840]   learned. They mastered English. They did the translating for the parents. There was nothing
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.200]   odd about this. There is even a sociological pattern about immigrants. The recent immigrant
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.440]   parents want to maintain the old country's traditions. They want the children to maintain
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.560]   these traditions, but they also want them to be successful. Their children steadily abandon the
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.680]   parents' traditions. They want to be integrated. They want to be like their friends at school.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.080]   They want to be seen as Americans. Their children assimilate even more completely.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.280]   It is difficult for people over 12 years old to learn a foreign language if they never have before.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.480]   A few adults have the knack, but most people don't. There is nothing odd about this. It is
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.600]   probably genetic. Stages of development. Small children master languages at incredible rates,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.400]   meaning incredible rates for older people. Multilingual children who grow up in multilingual
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.880]   environments are common. My father, who was stationed in Egypt during World War II,
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.120]   said that boys in the streets could speak German, Italian, and English with ease. They had been
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:26.440]   selling services to various invading armies, and they got along just fine. People adjust. They
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.040]   respond to incentives. If there are economic incentives and opportunities to assimilate,
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.160]   the children of immigrants do. Eight words that define America.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:43.400]   There are eight words in the English language which generally define Americans, as long as
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   they are not in Congress. These eight words are central to understanding the American character.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:59.080]   They have been basic to the American character for over 300 years. Here they are. Live and let live.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:06.600]   Let's make a deal. When civil governments get involved in the affairs of men, then these two
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:12.440]   sentences get compromised. The anti-immigration forces are opposed to this one. Live and let
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:19.160]   live. The protectionists are opposed to this one. Let's make a deal. Quite frequently,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.680]   we find people who are committed to both positions, and they call themselves conservatives.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:33.000]   Conservatives love to see customs houses. They love to see customs agents. They love to see
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.080]   immigration control officials. They trust Congress. They trust the bureaucracy,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.400]   but only at national borders. In other areas of life, they insist that they believe in the
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.680]   principles of limited government, but show a conservative a national border and he abandons
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.040]   his principles. He substitutes trust in the federal government as soon as he sees a national border.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:00.280]   Keep this in mind. Residency is not the same as citizenship. Conservatives confuse the two
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:08.200]   concepts. Americans did not begin making this mistake until World War I.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:15.800]   Thus concludes my reading of the article. In the original version, linked in the show notes,
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.840]   there was an additional paragraph with a commentary linking to a YouTube video,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.680]   but the YouTube video has been removed and I don't know what it was. There is also
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:30.600]   a link to Gary North's detailed study of immigration theory called The Sanctuary
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.240]   Society and Its Enemies, published in the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1998.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.840]   And so, if you were interested in those, follow the link in the show notes.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.960]   Thus concludes Gary North's article. What I always appreciated, I learned an enormous amount from
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.720]   Gary North over the years. I first stumbled upon him with regard to his commentary on economics,
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.200]   because I was interested in his biblical commentaries on economics, but I just enjoyed
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.240]   his writings on social theory, etc. I always found them so thought-provoking that I was always
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.080]   having my ideas challenged by him. I was a subscriber to his website for many years
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.360]   until his death and just really appreciated how he always challenged my ideas.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   There was one thing that was always true with North, is that if you were going to tangle with
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.600]   him, you better know what you believe and why you believe it and be able to defend it.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.920]   That makes you a stronger person. He was a formidable opponent. When you disagreed with
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:29.400]   him, he was just a formidable guy in every way. Let's now turn to the issues of the day.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:35.560]   It would be my guess that no more than, say, two or three percent of the listening audience
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.200]   would agree with everything that North has written in that article or the implications
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:50.440]   of what he stated, because in general, the U.S. society, as well as most societies around the
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:58.760]   world, are firmly and completely split on these two issues. And North's position is that one or
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.720]   both of these things has to fall. Now, I've defended this myself. I broadly agree with
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:12.760]   North, with his commentary. But as I see it, a society can have two things in existence,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:18.280]   excuse me, have one of these two things in existence. Either a society can have what
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.880]   we'll call for now open borders, which we'll define in just a moment, or a society can have
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:30.360]   a welfare state. But I do not believe that a society can have both of those things and function.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.600]   And a society is going to choose which of those things it's going to have.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:42.200]   As for me, my preference is to have a society that has open borders and no welfare state.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:48.440]   But I seem to be in the extreme minority on that preference. And in general,
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.320]   most of the societies in which we live have chosen to have a welfare state
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   and then to restrict immigration, although until now that is basically disappears.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.920]   Let me explain why I believe this is at the heart of the issue, at least in the U.S. American
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:14.680]   context. I do not believe that, broadly speaking, that most Americans are in any way racist. And
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.840]   I'm going to use the traditional version of that term, not the modern Ibram Kendi version of that
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.520]   term or definition of the term racist. What I mean is that in the modern society, especially U.S.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:33.720]   Americans, U.S. Americans do not care about the race of someone with whom they are interacting.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.680]   They don't care about the color of the skin. They don't care about someone's ethnic heritage,
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.880]   their cultural background, etc. Americans broadly believe in live and let live.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:49.240]   They don't really care. What they care about is service. What they care about is convenience.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:56.120]   What they care about is service one to another. And so when Americans criticize people,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   they don't criticize based upon the color of someone's skin. They criticize based upon the
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:10.040]   expression of someone's culture. And there are certain cultures that are extremely distasteful
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:17.000]   to Americans, which they tend to criticize quite broadly. But it's not due to any outward
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.320]   appearance or due to any kind of ethnic background. It's due to a culture that does not
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:31.960]   fit well with the American culture, broadly speaking. If you ask most Americans, especially
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.080]   the most anti-immigration Americans, if they care what color of skin their next door neighbor has
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:44.280]   or what color of skin or what ethnic background the mayor of their town has, broadly speaking,
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.640]   they don't generally care, as long as the person is not trying to force it upon that individual
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:56.840]   American. But when you bring the welfare state into it, now it drives that frustration very,
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.840]   very high. The welfare state basically says, "Listen, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.640]   steal money from you because you are a producer, you're a worker. I'm going to steal money from
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:13.800]   you, and I'm going to give it to other people who need the money more than you do." And when
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.560]   there is a system where the need is clearly defined – so, for example, if your average
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:25.000]   American working man sees that his money is being stolen from him in the form of taxes,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.760]   and it's going to support an old folks' home that's kind of a community outreach where he
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.880]   can see that, "Look, these people are broke and indigenous, and if they weren't there,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.560]   they'd be on the streets," etc., he's not going to resist too harshly. But when you bring
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:43.560]   immigration into it, and when you paint the idea in his mind, regardless of its truthfulness,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.440]   that those people are coming in here, and those people are, you know, taking advantage of our
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.680]   free healthcare and our hospitals, and those people are coming in here, and they're taking
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.520]   advantage of our free government schools, and those people are coming in here, and they're
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.840]   being handed debit cards, etc., that makes the average American's blood boil pretty significantly.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:08.440]   And so, as I see it, you can have one or two of these things. If you got rid of the welfare state,
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   I think, and there were no redistribution of wealth, but rather Americans were reminded that,
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.600]   "Hey, what you make is yours to keep. We're not going to steal it from you." There may be
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.000]   some small tax system to support a national military or something like that, but no welfare
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.200]   taxes. "What you make is yours to keep. You got a deal. You got to go out into the world to make
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.600]   it." And all those immigrants that are coming in, they're doing exactly the same thing. There's no
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   welfare state for them. They're not being given free debit cards. They're not being given free
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.880]   health care. They're not being given free education or anything like that. They got to make it.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:50.280]   Then, generally speaking, it's my instinct as a born and bred American that most Americans broadly
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:57.160]   would be willing to accept that deal. I have tested this theory in person with many of my
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:03.640]   friends, the most ardent Trump supporters, the most ardent anti-immigration people,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:10.600]   and also my liberal left-wing friends. And in general, I have not yet – no, not in general.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.640]   I have not yet found anyone to whom I have made this proposition who would reject it.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.440]   Again, the most anti-immigration people with whom I've interacted personally, when I have said to
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:27.880]   them, "Listen, would you be willing to have open borders if you knew that you were not having
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:35.160]   money stolen from you in the form of taxes to give any kind of handout to other people?" But in fact,
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.720]   all of those immigrants are coming of their own dime, and they're just coming to compete
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.280]   honestly in the labor force with you. They're not getting any handouts. Would you accept that?
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:50.920]   To this day, I have not had any person to whom I've had this conversation reject that scenario.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.320]   So I believe that, however, when you have a welfare state, I don't think you can have open
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.480]   borders because it creates such an enormous conflict of interest for people coming to the
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.760]   country. So not only do you get people who want to move to a country for the opportunities,
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.520]   but rather you also get people who want to move to the country because they can get an easy life,
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:20.840]   a free and easy life in the country. And so you have the problem of who the immigrants are.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.160]   It changes the basic character of the immigrants when they know they're going to get free stuff.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:31.320]   And then secondarily, it changes the experience of the people living in that country.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:37.880]   And so I believe you can either have a country that has open borders or you can have a country
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:44.680]   that has a welfare state, but you cannot have both for the long term. And ultimately,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:51.240]   a country that has both is going to make some enormous change in one direction or another.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.760]   Now, I have a few more points I want to make on this, and then we're going to move to personal
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:32:00.280]   finance application. But before I do so, I wanted to find the term open borders. You will notice
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:09.560]   that or an astute listener would notice a couple of specific restrictions that North in his essay
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.920]   passed. And I believe that these potential restrictions are important. So what does open
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:21.800]   borders mean? Does open borders mean that a country has no checkpoints or security control
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.920]   at its borders? Does open borders mean that a country doesn't have fences, that a country
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:33.080]   doesn't have immigration at its airports, et cetera? My answer is it might, but it's not
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:41.160]   strictly necessary. So there are two things that North pointed out. He said non-criminal immigrants,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.680]   and he also said healthy immigrants or non-ill immigrants. And these are two things that I think
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.720]   are completely compatible with open borders. So here would be an example of the kind of system
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.560]   that I myself would be happy to support if it were feasible in any world, which it's not in
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.640]   today's world, any world that I can find. Maybe Mars or something like that, or maybe it's the
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:07.240]   world a century from now, but it's not feasible. Is it okay for a country to have some form of
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.560]   checkpoint control? Because one of the things that North didn't address in his essay that you
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.680]   often hear modern anti-immigration or anti-illegal immigration people, however they want to style
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.200]   themselves, talk about is, well, all the terrorists are coming in, all the criminals
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.000]   are coming in. I think it would be perfectly reasonable for a government to have some
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.720]   system in place of checking for a person's criminal background. As I see it, I do not
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:39.160]   believe that any government in the world has the right to control the physical movements,
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:46.120]   physical geographical movements of any non-criminal person. So I do not believe that
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.160]   the state, let's say I live in the state of Florida, I do not believe that the government
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:55.480]   of the state of Georgia has the right to control my access to the state of Georgia from the state
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:02.200]   of Florida across the state line as long as I am a non-criminal person. In the same way,
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:08.200]   I do not believe that the government of the United States or the government of Mexico has
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:14.040]   the moral right or authority to control the physical geographic movement of any non-criminal
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.480]   person. People can travel around the world as they want, and as long as someone is not
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.640]   a criminal person, I do not believe that a government has control over their body. Why
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.280]   should they? Why should any government have control over someone? To believe in that is
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.880]   to believe in tyranny, in absolute tyranny, to say that a government can arbitrarily decide
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:42.200]   who they control. Now, what is this and who can go where in the world? It's insane.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.640]   It's an insane concept that has become utterly normal in our modern society, but it's crazy
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.800]   when you actually stop and think about it. Why should any government have the right to control
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:57.400]   the physical movement of a non-criminal person? And look at COVID as a perfect recent example
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.440]   of what the world experienced. How stupid was it to believe that the government had the right to
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.200]   say, "You have to stay in your zone. You can't go out and walk your dog. You can't go to the
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   state park and ride your skateboard and dump it. We're going to dump it full of sand." Utterly
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:17.560]   ridiculous. They arrested people on the beach. Insane tyranny everywhere. And even there was
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:23.800]   more justifiable in case of a public health emergency and an infectious disease pandemic,
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.520]   which we'll go to in a moment, of a diseased person. But let's deal with criminality first.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:35.480]   Who does government have authority over? My answer is government has authority
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:41.560]   over criminal persons. That is the basic central role of government.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:50.600]   God has appointed the existence of government on earth to deal with the behavior of criminal
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:59.400]   persons. A government has one task, and that is to constrain the evildoer and to eliminate evil
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.480]   from the earth. Evil people who commit evil actions must be removed from society,
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.080]   and that is the basic function of government. Now, there are enormous and extremely important
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:17.560]   restrictions on the exercise of that right by government powers. There must be multiple
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.840]   witnesses. There must be a legal system. There must be abundant evidence. There must be due
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:29.000]   process. There must be presumption of innocence, etc. An accused has the right to face his accuser,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.320]   etc. So there can be no kind of nighttime raids by thugs in helmets and bulletproof vests who
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.080]   swoop in in the early morning and arrest people out of their beds. No, not a chance.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.000]   There can be no secret courtrooms with no cameras, etc. All judicial proceedings should be public,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.840]   and there should be a presumption of innocence, and there should be due process in all judicial
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:55.240]   proceedings. But at its core, the basic function of government is to restrain the evildoer.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:02.520]   And there is a component as an expression of that whereby a government official could do this
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:08.040]   in the context of open borders. And so would it be allowable to have a government that has
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:13.080]   open borders and say that there's a government official to whom you have to present your
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.840]   identity documents, to whom you have to present a federal background check of some kind or a law
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:24.680]   enforcement check, etc., to make certain that a country or a city or a state is not allowing
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.640]   criminal persons into their midst? My answer is I would be okay with that. I would be willing to
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:35.080]   accept that. But here we see the other fundamental flaw in the modern immigration debate, is that
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:42.280]   simultaneous with the enormous flow of immigrants across the border, without any meaningful
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.120]   checkpoints or restrictions, simultaneous with that, we have the enormous end the police movement.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.440]   And while I'm sympathetic to a lot of the arguments of the, you know, the defund the police
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:59.800]   movement and the – broadly speaking, these are two things that I do not believe can coexist.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.920]   Because as people are finding more and increasing criminality expressed in their community,
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:12.760]   the fear is rising. And one of the basic ways that a government retains its power and its
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:20.600]   authority in society is to maintain security, is to maintain peace. Yesterday in my children's
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.360]   homeschool, we were talking about feudalism. We were talking about the feudal system,
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   feudal structure of society and feudalism and how it worked. And what I think is often mistaken by
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:36.280]   people who are broadly sympathetic to the serfs working for the lord of the manor, etc., is the
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:43.400]   basic reason that this structure existed in the first place, which was due to attack by roving
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.520]   bands of marauders across Europe. And so what the lords and the serfs did in the feudal system was
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.200]   they made a deal. The deal was this. The lord of the manor and the lord of the countryside would
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.640]   develop a private army of knights and dukes and earls, etc., nobles. This private army would
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:05.880]   defend the people and keep the peace. That way, the peasants, the serfs, could till their land
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.600]   in peace and not worry about being murdered and raped in their beds, not worry about having their
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.240]   harvest stolen by bands of marauders. And the portion of their harvest that they had to turn
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.480]   over to the lord and the serf in the form of – sorry, the lord of the manor, the dukes and the
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.760]   earls, etc., the nobility system, the portion of their harvest they turned over in the form of taxes
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:32.040]   was a better deal than having their produce stolen by bands of marauders. If you look back at the
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:39.160]   history of humanity, there were societies in which people hunted and gathered for themselves.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.880]   But the instant you had a transition to a stable farming society, then you had rise to increased
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.600]   levels of violence because people who didn't want to do the backbreaking work of tending to their
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.960]   own farm and keeping their own crops, etc., realized, "I can go over to my neighbor there,
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.440]   who he's doing the work all the time, and I can just show up at harvest time. And with a sharp
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:06.520]   spear or a bow and arrow or my own physical size and a club or whatever tool of war I happen to
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.240]   have, I can intimidate him and I can steal his crops and I can steal all of them from him."
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.480]   And so you have increased needs for security to protect crops, and this makes an enormous
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.560]   difference in the history of nations and the history of individuals as well. So whenever
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:30.840]   there is insecurity in a society or even perceived insecurity, the people will call out and respond
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:37.400]   favorably to somebody who can provide that security. Let me tie in now a modern event.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:43.320]   Over the past few days, the president of El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele,
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:50.840]   won his presidential re-election campaign in an absolute landslide. I don't have the specific
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:57.240]   figures of his initial victory, but as I recall, it was a close election. When he came into office,
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:02.200]   he faced significant opposition. But over the course of his most recent presidential term,
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.800]   he has taken certain actions in the country that resulted in him receiving an absolute
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:14.840]   landslide of the vote, something like 85% of the vote. And it's one of the most stunning
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:20.760]   victories by any political candidate, at least in my lifetime.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   Now, what led to that? Well, if you don't follow Latin American politics, you might have at least
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:31.160]   some idea of the fact that, historically speaking, El Salvador has been an extremely unsafe country
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:37.560]   in Latin America. El Salvador was the one country in Latin America that I myself was scared to go to
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:43.320]   in the past. I've traveled a lot in Latin America. The one country I never went to and I was scared
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:51.480]   to go to was El Salvador, due to an absurdly high murder rate in the country. Putting the story very
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.880]   short, Bukele came into office. He marshaled the military forces, built enormous prison,
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:04.200]   built an enormous prison, went out of the streets, and arrested, on a wide scale,
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.880]   arrested all of the gang members in the country, identified by their having gang tattoos,
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:18.440]   primarily. Imprisoned them all in an enormous prison complex, an enormous prison complex,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:27.640]   created cinema-quality advertisement promotional materials for this movement, and cleaned up the
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:34.120]   streets of El Salvador in a completely unprecedented way, leading to, over the course of, what is it,
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.360]   a couple of years, something like that, El Salvador going from the country with basically
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:43.720]   the highest murder rate in the world to, if not the lowest murder rate in the world,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.080]   a lower statistical murder rate than, I don't know, the United States, currently speaking.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   And this has had an absolutely transformative effect on the El Salvadorian society, on the
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:04.360]   country, on the commerce, the business, etc. Previously in El Salvador, due to the gang
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.080]   control and gang warfare happening across the country, you didn't let your children go to the
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.960]   park, families stayed in their homes, you didn't go to that next block over because it was controlled
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:19.000]   by a rival gang, etc. Well, today, the country is totally transformed. The people feel safe,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.560]   they go out and they play. And what's happening is there's enormous flows, not only of money,
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:28.920]   to the country, and there are other things as well. He's embraced various things. He's working
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.440]   hard to build the infrastructure in the country and improve the highways. He's made radical moves,
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:42.360]   such as embracing Bitcoin as an official currency, etc. But enormously also due to the
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:50.120]   increase in safety, there is an increase in tourism to El Salvador. But more importantly,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.880]   there's an increase in El Salvadorians who are from the diaspora, who had gone abroad,
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.720]   now returning home more regularly to visit their friends and families and looking and saying,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.120]   "How could we bring money back? How could we invest into this country? It feels like a new country."
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:11.640]   And so at its core, the basic point I want to make is that when a politician can create
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:20.680]   peace in the streets and can create a society of comfort—sorry, of safety, and what I'm
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:26.520]   deriving of comfort is not only actual safety but perceived safety, that politician will receive
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:33.960]   broad levels of support. And if a politician allows increases in crime, increases in insecurity,
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.800]   for example, homeless people camping on your front lawn, things like that, which may or may
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:45.640]   not be associated with crime, but it certainly is associated with perceived insecurity and perceived
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:51.480]   decay—if a politician cannot see to that basic order, the politician or the political party or
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:57.240]   whomever is going to lose support. But if the people feel secure, then they will have support.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.480]   And everything else is secondary to that. So if you go throughout political history and you look
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:09.320]   at the feudal system or you look at the modern world, you look and see, "Why do the mafia have
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.760]   control? Why are the Taliban so popular in Afghanistan?" Well, the answer is they see to
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.880]   the needs of the people. And ISIS can come into your village, but if ISIS can get you clean water
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.840]   and secure streets for you to walk around, etc., then people are going to wind up supporting ISIS
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.000]   because at its core, that's what we want from government. We want government to work. And the
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.040]   core basic function of government working is get rid of the criminals so that honest people can live
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:42.360]   and not be in fear of their life. Now, interestingly also, what does the U.S.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:50.120]   Society do? Well, here is an editorial from Today in the New York Times, guest editorial
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:58.520]   by Dr. Will Freeman and Lucas Pereyo. I never know how to pronounce things in the
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:04.360]   Spanish accent or English accent. I go back and forth. "Why Nayib Bukele's anti-crime model for
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   El Salvador won't work in other countries." Here are a few paragraphs. "Voters in El Salvador this
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:13.240]   week gave their tough-on-crime president a sweeping mandate. Keep going. While votes are
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.040]   still being counted, President Nayib Bukele claims he won re-election by a landslide with more than
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.240]   85% of the vote. If those results hold when the official count is announced, not even Latin
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:28.680]   America's best-known populist presidents like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez or Bolivia's Evo Morales
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.560]   will have come close to winning election by such margins. Mr. Bukele's unparalleled rise
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:39.800]   comes down to a single factor, El Salvador's stunning crime drop. Since he took office in 2019,
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:48.360]   intentional homicide rates have decreased from 38 per 100,000 in that year to 7.8 in 2022,
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:54.840]   well below the Latin American average of 16.4 for the same year. The crackdown Mr. Bukele has led
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.720]   on organized crime has all but dismantled the infamous street gangs that terrorized the
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:05.240]   population for decades. It also exacted a tremendous price on Salvadorans' human rights,
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.760]   civil liberties, and democracy. Since March 2022, when Mr. Bukele declared a state of emergency
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:16.680]   that suspended basic civil liberties, security forces have locked up roughly 75,000 people.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.800]   A staggering one in 45 adults is now in prison. Other leaders in the neighborhood are taking
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.640]   notice and have debated adopting many of the same drastic measures to fight their own criminal
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.880]   violence. But even if they wanted to make the trade-off that Mr. Bukele's government has,
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.960]   making streets safer through methods that are blatantly at odds with democracy,
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.200]   they aren't likely to succeed. The conditions that enabled Mr. Bukele's success and political
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.320]   stardom are unique to El Salvador and can't be exported. And it goes on and talks about how,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:49.160]   how, I'll just read it, "Walking the streets of the capital, San Salvador, in the days before the
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:54.120]   election, we saw firsthand how families with children have returned to parks. People can
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.160]   now cross formerly impassable gang-controlled borders between neighborhoods. The city center,
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:05.080]   which for years was largely empty by sunset, is now lively late into the night. But El Salvador,
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:11.240]   which transitioned to democracy in the 1990s, has veered off that path. Mr. Bukele now controls
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:17.080]   all government branches. The nation of 6.4 million is run as a police state. Soldiers and police
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.880]   officers routinely whisk citizens off the streets and into prison indefinitely without providing a
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.440]   reason or allowing them access to a lawyer. There are credible reports that inmates have been
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.920]   tortured. Government critics told us they have been threatened with prosecution and journalists
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.800]   have been spied on. Even last Sunday's vote is under a microscope after the transmission system
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.920]   for the results of the preliminary vote count collapsed in a highly unusual manner." And they
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:46.040]   go on and talk about things in Ecuador and what was unique about El Salvador, etc. The point is
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:51.720]   that what I find fascinating about that paragraph is there are a lot of people of basically any
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.280]   country in the world, the United States, the country I know best, but many other countries
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:03.000]   who, if I read that paragraph and simply transposed the name of my own country,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:10.280]   my own native country to that, then it wouldn't be too far off the mark. Now, I think that a lot of
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:16.440]   that is just perception rather than reality, but perception is ultimately what matters. I have
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:22.280]   friends who have been whisked off into prison, and they were ultimately provided with access to a
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.240]   lawyer, but they were in prison with no charges made for an enormously long period of time.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:32.040]   And all of us are now in the United States accustomed to finding out there's some early
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:37.080]   morning raid. We're accustomed to having closed courtrooms where we don't know the—we can't see
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.400]   what's happening. We don't know what's happening in the argument. We can't even see who the jurors
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:49.080]   are. Even when we can find a camera feed from a courtroom, which obviously doesn't happen in
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.600]   federal courtrooms where they really need them the most, at least most many state courtrooms,
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:58.680]   we have camera feeds now, but we can't even find out who the jurors are, which is insane.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:05.400]   And so the voting process under a microscope for unusual results when the preliminary vote count
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.120]   collapsed in a highly unusual manner, these are the things that are common to many of our
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:18.040]   experiences. And so, as I see it, no political system can stand if it doesn't provide for the
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.720]   basic needs of the people. And that was true about feudalism. It's true about modern democratic
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:29.320]   systems. If modern democratic systems can't provide these basic needs of the people,
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:36.760]   security—if our communities do not feel safe and they're not actually safe, then it erodes trust.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:42.840]   And the problem with democracy is that for those who are in the minority, if their needs are not
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:50.760]   met, it feels just as tyrannical as if your country is run by a dictator. And if you go
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.160]   around the world and you look at different political systems, a government that is run
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:03.880]   by a noble tyrant, a nobly-minded dictator, is often an extremely attractive form of government.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:10.760]   You see that in a place like Singapore. One of the most incredible transformations in modern
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.960]   society, one of the most successful advanced modern states, etc., was run by an extremely
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:21.880]   powerful, extremely heavy-handed—I'm not insulting him to say it—but quasi-dictator.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.520]   And we see that around the world, is that I would be happy to live under a dictator if the
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:33.320]   dictator's interests are aligned with my own. That experience is far preferable to living under
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:40.520]   control by a tyrannical mob whose interests don't align with my own. And they control my life
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:46.840]   exceedingly, and yet I'm in the minority. It doesn't feel any better than it does to live under
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.760]   a dictator whose interests are aligned with my own. Now, hear me clearly, there is another way,
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.560]   and that's what we've been trying to work on for a long period of time. And that, I think,
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:04.920]   was the beauty of the American system, which was a system where the interests of—sorry,
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.360]   the control of government was restricted to the local level where democratic expression
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:17.000]   is more appropriate, and the power of the state on any level is severely weakened
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.120]   just to the most essential of elements. But I don't want to go any further into political theory.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:28.680]   It makes me sad to see what my own country has become. But let's deal honestly with some of the
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:34.440]   issues. And so let me bring clarity to a few of these points. Number one, when you're dealing
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.240]   with an immigration issue and an immigration crisis, as the United States is clearly dealing
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:44.840]   with, you have a choice between open borders or a welfare state. And the fact that the United
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:51.880]   States is currently embracing a welfare state, a very broad welfare state, and open borders
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:58.280]   is poisoning the conversation enormously. I see no solution to this problem, by the way. I have
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:03.080]   no solutions whatsoever. I don't believe that Americans are ready to give up on either of those
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:09.480]   things at the moment. Ironically, even those who have voted, for example, for immigration controls,
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:15.160]   many of the voters who voted for President Trump in the year—when was he elected? 2020.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:24.040]   A prime issue of their voting for him was to end illegal immigration and to build a wall.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:31.240]   As I understand, according to Peter Zeihan, what is ironic about that effort is that previously,
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:36.280]   the United States had a fairly effective wall on its southern border, just like it has a fairly
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.840]   effective wall on its northern border. The wall on much of the northern border is an enormous
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.400]   wilderness. On the southern border, it's an enormous desert. And that desert was famously
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:51.160]   very difficult to cross until the construction of a border wall, which required the installation
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:57.320]   of roads for the contractors to be able to build the wall. And so now there's a network of roads
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.840]   crossing a previously impassable desert, which makes it easy for people who are transporting
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.880]   immigrants to drive them most of the way, and then they just have to walk a little bit and
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:13.240]   get picked up by another car. Whereas previously, there was a natural defense of a desert.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.960]   I find that an interesting analysis, as far as I know it's true, but I have not been there
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:25.880]   to walk the wall myself to see exactly to the extent of its truthfulness. So it's just ironic
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:32.120]   that here's this thing that's supposed to reduce immigration, building a wall, and meanwhile it
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:39.240]   winds up enabling easier immigration across the border because of the construction methodology.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.080]   Similarly, of course, there's plenty of places where the wall is climbed over and it's cut
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:48.600]   through, etc. Just a dumb idea. Doesn't work, didn't work, no point in it, etc.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.960]   But we're in an insolvable crisis. I don't see how these two things can be reconciled. So as
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.800]   best I can tell, things are going to continue as they are, back and forth, back and forth,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.800]   until we see some kind of broad-scale collapse of the system.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.840]   The second point I was making is that you could have a version of open borders,
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:12.040]   while also having some form of checkpoints, identity verification, criminal verification,
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.680]   or verification of non-criminality, etc. And then related to that, you could also have
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   verification of healthfulness. So let's say that what I would love to see would be,
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:29.240]   I would love to see all visa restrictions abolished so that anybody who wants to move
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.760]   to the United States could move to the United States. All they have to do is come. But when
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:42.120]   coming, I would love them to have to bring a certificate from the police background of their
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:47.880]   own state and present that certificate of non-criminality. Here's a federal background
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.560]   check. This shows that I'm not a wanted criminal, etc. This is, by the way, a standard procedure
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:57.000]   for all immigration programs. Every time I get a residency or apply for some kind of government
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.640]   thing, I have to bring a federal background check from the FBI, etc. So that's standard procedure.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:08.200]   There's a well-proven system in place for that. And then also, a medical check showing I don't
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:14.680]   have any infectious diseases run by a doctor, etc. And again, this is also a standard part of
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:18.680]   many countries' immigration systems that you have to have a certificate of health.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:25.320]   And so this kind of thing, to me, would be great. I would be thrilled if somebody would do this.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:29.640]   Because this is the point I think that most conservatives miss, the point that North made
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:35.720]   quite strongly, is that why do you think that a government bureaucrat can somehow figure out
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.760]   how many workers we need for a X, Y, Z visa class? How many tech workers we need? How many
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.520]   farm workers? How many of this worker? How many of that worker? You don't have a clue.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:52.760]   And what I find fascinating is that one of the great challenges that every businessman I know,
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:59.160]   including many in very menial trades, in agriculture, etc., as well as many in tech and
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:04.840]   kind of high-level businesses, they can't get enough workers. And so they have to go through
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.640]   all these quota programs and apply for a certain number of workers, etc., and it's an enormous
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:15.240]   problem with paperwork. And if the United States would simplify this system, nay, eliminate any
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.880]   restrictions, then the country would have an enormous competitive advantage and would be able
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.360]   to attract some of the world's greatest immigrants, which would be an incredible
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:29.960]   boon to the country. It would be an incredible boon to the country's economy. More people
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:35.240]   makes for a much more vibrant economy. It would lower the average age in the country,
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:39.080]   which would lead to increasing vibrance. And I think that for all of the problems that the
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:44.600]   United States has, I think the United States is better at assimilating immigrants into the nation
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:53.240]   than any other country in the world, because our culture is one of a creed rather than an ethnicity.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:59.480]   Our culture is very, very inclusive of anybody from any place as long as they buy into the
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:05.240]   national creed, the basic set of beliefs that compose the civil religion of the United States.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:11.160]   And if those people buy into that, then we accept them as Americans no matter what. This is why it's
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:20.200]   very common for Americans to have a friend who just moved over from the UK or Somalia or Japan,
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:26.360]   etc., and two years later, an American will make a comment like, "Man, you're an American through
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:31.240]   and through. You're totally American." And it has nothing to do with immigration status. The person
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.440]   may or may not have a visa. The person may or may not be a U.S. citizen. It has to do with culture,
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:41.160]   because if somebody embraces the American culture, regardless of accent, regardless of language,
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:47.240]   etc., then Americans accept them. This is very different than other nations that are primarily
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:55.880]   a nation due to an ethnic identity of some kind or your family's history here, etc.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:00.520]   So I think it would be an incredible boon to the country to have that kind of system.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:09.400]   And I understand that people want to protect their stuff. It always seems better to go and
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.960]   form a cartel to protect your industry and protect your occupation. And the free market
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:20.520]   ultimately systematically tears those things down. So not only is it morally repugnant to me
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.240]   to build cartels to protect your industry from outsiders just because so you can get all the
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:32.360]   money, but it's just philosophically dumb. It's a dumb way to live, and it hinders human progress
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.160]   and human advancement. Those would be some expressions of what I would love to see as an
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:42.040]   ideal system, an orderly system. I would be fine with checkpoints, etc., and I think it would be
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:48.360]   a great benefit to the country. What do we think about the current system? Well, it's absolute
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:58.600]   chaos, and it is fundamentally – it is horrific what is happening right now. The mass transfer of
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:05.080]   people across the southern border with very few checks, and the checks that are happening are
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:14.040]   fake. As far as I see it – I try to be careful with the use of the word "immoral," but they're
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:19.160]   really, really bad. And it's bad for multiple reasons, and I believe that the current
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:28.040]   crisis is bad for all three parties. So first and foremost, the current crisis is bad for immigrants,
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:35.000]   and the reason it's bad is because they are heading into a situation that is going to be
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.320]   terrible for decades. What I mean is there's not – the system I described that I would love to see
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:47.240]   happen doesn't exist in the United States. It doesn't exist, and it's not going to exist,
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:52.200]   as far as I can tell, for a very long period of time. And so, when immigrants are coming to the
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:58.360]   United States, they're primarily coming in because they're applying for asylum. We're not exercising
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:04.840]   any kind of significant checks as to the claims of fear that someone makes in their demand for
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.120]   asylum. We're just broadly handing out court dates, and these court dates are years in the future.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.840]   And right now, for every immigrant that I know to the United States system,
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:25.960]   the entire U.S. immigration system is completely – I don't even know what adjective to use. It's
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.920]   just totally screwed up. It doesn't work. It's terrible. I have friends who are going through
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:36.600]   the system, have followed every law, have tried to do everything, and they just sit in limbo
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:42.760]   forever. And court system here, and it gets kicked out there, and et cetera. And so, going into the
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:49.080]   U.S. immigration system is a nightmare, where you just sit and sit and sit and sit, and there's no
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.840]   serious attention being given to the lives of the people who are sitting there. And so, I would never
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:01.320]   want to get involved with the U.S. immigration system if I didn't have to. It's not that it can't
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.480]   be done. There are some people, and if you can have a highly desirable job and your company can
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.680]   afford a great lawyer, et cetera, they can grease the skids and get something resolved. But you will
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.640]   spend years just waiting and waiting and waiting. And so, all of these people, poor people who are
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.760]   coming into the United States, trying to build something for themselves, they're going to be
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:27.000]   stuck into a system where they're second-class citizens, and they can't get legal status,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.320]   they can't get legal standing, et cetera. And this is terrible also for their children.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.240]   If their children are not born in the United States, it puts their children into enormous limbo.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.880]   And if they leave the United States, they can't come back because of the very restrictive system
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.040]   that the United States has on travel. The only way to come in and out is to cross the border
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.520]   illegally, because the whole system of getting into the United States with a highly restrictive
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:57.880]   visa system is utterly screwed up. And so, I believe that it's a moral wrong to create these
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:06.120]   expectations for the immigrants. Number two, it's a moral catastrophe for the existing citizenry of
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.720]   the United States, because what they are seeing on a day-to-day basis is chaos. And let me just
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.440]   do the third one next. It's a moral catastrophe for the government itself. What you have right
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.960]   now in the United States, forgive me if I'm ranting, I know I'm ranting, but if you're
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:27.080]   listening, I assume it's useful to you. The current system of the United States
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:34.440]   and what the government is doing to itself is a catastrophe. Because when I, as a law-abiding
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.000]   citizen, see that the government is not enforcing its own laws in any meaningful way,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.840]   and it's clearly visible with hordes of people walking across a river, and that the Border Patrol
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:57.560]   is non-functional in terms of actually – I mean, poor guys. I have a friend of mine who I
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.960]   talked to about this sometime, former Border Patrol agent. I cannot even imagine trying to
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.080]   work in that government agency. Got to be the lowest morale across any government agency right
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:15.000]   now. And so, you're creating a system in which you are watching people flout your laws. And that
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.440]   is a bad pathway to go down. Because as law-abiding citizens watch you as the government
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:29.400]   allow, be permissive of people flouting your laws, disobeying your laws with impunity,
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:37.320]   nay, you're even encouraging it in every way possible, then that causes ordinary law-abiding
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:45.080]   citizens to say, "Why am I taking the trouble to follow the laws? Why am I doing that?"
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:52.200]   Your journey to enterprise AI is full of opportunities and challenges. How can I
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:59.240]   keep costs down? How can I keep my data safe? How can I use all of my data wherever it lives?

[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:25.080]   highly respectful of the law and who police themselves based upon their respect for the law,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.240]   you are breeding discontentedness and disrespect for the law, which is going to make your job as
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.880]   a government much more difficult in the future. Because people say, "Why should I obey a law that
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.640]   he's not obeying?" And I would compare it to this. I haven't seen this personally,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.520]   but I've heard this described by a couple of people. But let's say that it's opening morning
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:50.040]   of fishing season. And what I've heard fishermen say sometimes, let's say that fishing season for
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:06:00.840]   XYZ fish opens at 8 o'clock a.m. on June 1, and you'll be down at the river, and it's 7.45 a.m.,
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.720]   and everyone is sitting there waiting. They're all lined up. You can see all your fishermen. It's 7.45,
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.760]   and everyone's waiting, and waiting until 8 o'clock. But then around, say, 7.54,
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:16.440]   Joe Schmo tosses a line in the water. And all of a sudden, the guy next to Joe says, "Well,
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.520]   I'm going to do it." And he tosses his line in the water too. And at 7.57, everyone's got their lines
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:29.480]   in the water, except for the 10% of highly committed, law-abiding people. They're going
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   to wait until 8 o'clock. They're going to wait that extra three minutes. Meanwhile, they watch
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.800]   all their friends pulling the fish out, and they feel, "Why am I the sucker? I'm the sucker who's
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.440]   sitting here obeying the law. Why am I the sucker?" This has been something for years that has bothered
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:49.800]   me enormously, is that I aspire to be a law-abiding person. I aspire to be a model citizen. I'm not
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:56.760]   always, but I want to be. I would compare it to things like welfare programs. My aspiration has
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:04.120]   always been to be somebody who is not on welfare, to always be somebody who is a producer, not a
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:11.080]   consumer. I want to help my neighbor. I want to be a supporter. Those are the ideals and the civic
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.520]   virtues to which I aspire. And half the time, I live my life as a sucker. And it's like, "Well,
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:20.280]   everyone else is taking advantage of that program. Why don't you?" And when you look around and you
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.880]   see all the immoral and unethical people getting rich, it makes it very, very hard for you to
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.400]   stand up and say, "No, I believe this," even though it doesn't. And when you create that
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   kind of society, that makes things really bad. And that's where we're at. The governmental—so,
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:45.960]   you know, a government that does it this way, that pursues illegal means to get its end,
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:53.480]   I have zero respect for. Be straight about what you want. Speak the truth about what you want.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.520]   Be willing to stand behind your convictions and do it properly in the public view.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.360]   And if you say, "This is what we're going to do," then say it so that people can vote on it,
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:08.600]   if you're going to believe in democracy. Or at least do it. Don't do it by hiddenness and by
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:14.520]   non-enforcement, etc., because you destroy trust and confidence in your government. And I think
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.160]   that is what is happening to the U.S. government. And finally, I mentioned it's immoral to the
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:26.440]   citizens, because what they're getting is not what they voted for. And you could say, "Well,
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.040]   people get what they vote for. You know, President Biden won the presidency, so people should have
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.960]   known." Yeah, but President Biden didn't say, "This is what I'm going to do." At least I don't
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.280]   remember. Maybe he did, and I just was ignorant. But I'm not aware of him saying, "I'm going to
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.840]   eliminate all imposition of law so that people can—so tens of thousands of people can cross
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.640]   the border illegally. We're going to destroy the definition of what it means for asylum seekers.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.840]   We're not going to ask for any verifiable evidence. What we're going to do is we're
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.440]   going to give people a court date that's a few years down and get as many people into the country
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.720]   as possible." There is no way you can look at the current system and see that it's anything except
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.080]   intentional. But it was not stated by candidate Joe Biden when he was running for president,
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.720]   nor was it stated by anybody else who's doing it. It's all being done. And so this is immoral
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:21.240]   to the citizenry, because the entire point of a democratic system is that the people can vote for
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:27.000]   what they want. And so the politicians say, "Here's what we'll do for you," and then the people vote
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.320]   for that. And so when you have that, it makes people feel like their voices are heard, okay?
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:40.840]   And this has been fundamental to the American fabric of society. All right, I lost. I lost
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.520]   on that issue. But that's okay. It was a free and public vote. The majority has it or the plurality
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.400]   has it, whatever the case may be. I lost. That's okay. I'm happy to lose. And after all, we're all
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:57.080]   Americans here. And I can go along and I'll just fight next time in the political system. But you
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.240]   see that that confidence and trust is breaking down. So is it a temporary thing? Is it a permanent
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:10.600]   thing? I have no idea. I hope it's just temporary, but it makes me sad because the current chaos is
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:19.400]   deeply immoral. It's at least counterproductive, and I think it's wrong. It's wrong. It's not the
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.040]   way that it should be done on any level. It's not an honest debate, and it's going to lead to
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:32.920]   increasing levels of unrest, increasing levels of discontentedness, increasing levels of vitriol.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   I don't see a solution in the political space that is going to have an impact.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.360]   All the rest of the stuff, there's minor things about terrorists are coming. All that stuff is
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:50.200]   dumb. If a terrorist tries to sneak into the country across the southern border and blow up
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.880]   a bomb, you shoot him. We're a country of gun owners. We just shoot people. It's no big deal.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:05.160]   There's no meaningful risk of terrorism or Chinese infiltrators, etc. It's an enormous
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.880]   benefit. The last comment – I want to move to the personal application and personal finance – but
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:19.560]   the last comment is simply that, as a Christian, I am amazed. So I'm trying to present – clearly,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:27.640]   what I'm describing comes from theological conviction of open borders, what I've advocated
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:33.800]   for, etc., and then care for people. But on the whole, I'm just amazed that the Christians in the
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:38.600]   United States, broadly speaking, are not paying attention to what's happening. There's an enormous
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.720]   fear that people have that the immigrants are going to come to the United States and they're
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.680]   going to change our way. Go back to the Russians. The Russian spies are going to come in and they're
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.920]   going to sow problems and they're going to change the society. The Russians couldn't keep any of
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.920]   their spies employed. They'd send them to the United States and all their spies would defect.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.440]   And so it's the same thing. Muslims can barely hang on to their Muslim identity when they go
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.880]   to the United States. And people from all around the world, the American culture is so strong and
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:12.760]   it's an enormous opportunity. And I wish that – just a personal thing, I guess – but I just wish
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.080]   that Christians would open up and pay attention. As far as I'm concerned, God is sending the entire
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.600]   world's masses to the country, which is a lot easier to engage in good missionary service and
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.280]   evangelism with your neighbors around the block than it is to pay to send people overseas in
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:35.800]   precarious situations. And so kind of the broad anti-immigration stance of so many evangelical
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:43.400]   churches drives me nuts. I think they should be affirming what I have said about affirming that
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.600]   the chaos is unacceptable and that it's hurting people, it's hurting, as I said, the immigrants
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:54.360]   themselves, it's hurting the Americans who are already in the country, and it's hurting the
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.560]   government. And so the chaos is unacceptable. But the broad kind of anti-immigration stance
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:05.160]   is, to me, crazy. But that's probably the most inflammatory thing I've said so far.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.760]   Let's move now to the personal applications of this. And I want to make two applications. Number
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.440]   one, if you are an immigrant or considering immigrating to the United States – don't have
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:20.280]   too many of those in my audience – or if you are already living in the United States and you don't
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:26.680]   have legal status in the country, what should you do? Well, first of all, I think that generally
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:32.120]   speaking, most people should not use this pathway to try to immigrate to the United States. This is
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.720]   a bad pathway. So recently on a Q&A show, I had a caller who called in and said – I think it was
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.440]   German – said, "I'd like to move to the United States." You cannot be – even as tempting as it
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.640]   may be – to say, "I'm going to fly to Mexico and I'm going to sneak across the border and make an
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:52.920]   asylum application." I do not see any fruitful benefit there in that. When you are an illegal
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:58.920]   immigrant to the United States, you are a genuine second-class citizen. Everything is closed to you.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.600]   I guess I should have said you are a metaphorical second-class citizen, because you're not a
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.400]   citizen. You're a second-class person. Everything is closed to you. There are a few places you can
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.800]   get a driver's license, etc., but you will spend all of your time looking over your shoulder.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.760]   Now, you don't have to worry generally about an immigration officer sweeping you up.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:25.400]   What you have to worry about is you have to worry about an employer not being able to hire you,
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:31.640]   because this is what governments do, is they use functionaries to enforce their rules.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:37.320]   So let me give you an example, okay? Why does everybody go across the U.S. border with Mexico
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:43.880]   instead of flying into New York City? The reason is due to the American visa system, that there are
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:50.760]   only, what is it, 30-something countries that have... There's one country's citizens who can
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.400]   travel to the United States without a visa and without prior authorization. That country is
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.000]   Canada. So Canadians can travel to the United States without a visa. U.S. immigration officers
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:09.400]   still can turn away Canadian citizens, of course, and they routinely do if they find any intent to
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.800]   immigrate to the United States. And so if you show up at the Canadian border with your car
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.760]   packed full of gear and you're going down to "spend some time" with your girlfriend in Los Angeles,
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:24.760]   you're probably not going to make it into the country, because U.S. immigration officers
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.640]   would view that as intent to immigrate. Unless you have an immigration visa processed in advance,
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:37.960]   not going to happen. Other countries of the world who come from a list of whose citizens have a
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.280]   generally high acceptance rate for tourist visas can travel to the United States with an electronic
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:50.040]   travel authorization. So if you're from the UK or from France or from Germany or from, you know,
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.080]   Japan, etc., then you can... I think Japan. You can travel to the United States using the ESTA
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:00.440]   program, the Electronic Secure Traveler Act or something, but it's an electronic pre-admission.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.120]   And as long as you have that done, they'll let you board the plane and then again you'll probably be
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:09.240]   able to get into the country. The immigration officers will still turn you away at the airport
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.800]   if they think that you have intent to immigrate to the United States and you don't have an
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:20.840]   immigration visa pre-existing. Everyone else around the world has to apply for a visa to travel into
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:27.960]   or even to pass through the United States. And that visa system is extremely onerous.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:35.160]   The visa costs, I think, is $160. You have to pay it regardless of whether you are accepted
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.720]   or denied. It's just a payment no matter what. You have to bring a mountain of paperwork and
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:45.960]   basically you have to prove to the immigration officer in the U.S. embassy abroad that you don't
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:51.560]   have immigrant intent to the United States, that in fact you are highly connected to the place that
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:56.680]   you live and you don't have the intent to move to the United States and overstay your tourist visa.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.080]   And it's quite an onerous process. Even all of the formalities of getting the appointment
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.520]   are often difficult. Some embassies you can't even get an appointment for a year or two.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.840]   And then you say, "Well, I want to move to the United States with some kind of immigration visa."
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:14.440]   Good luck. They are very, very difficult to get unless you are highly sought after.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.640]   And so what is the solution? Well, the solution for many people around the world who have zero
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:26.760]   hope of proving to an immigration officer that they can pass these checks, etc., is to go to
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:33.000]   the physical border of the United States, to come in across a sea border on a boat of some kind and
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.160]   land on the beach or to come across the southern border. And so that's what people are doing,
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:43.720]   largely from Central and South America, walking in some cases through the Darien Gap,
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.040]   using the bus system and local transportation, getting transportation to the border and then
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.920]   walking across the border. And they're doing it because they can gain easier access into many of
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.520]   these countries, even if they have limited documentation. They at least have visa-free
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.120]   access if they have a passport or they accept their cedula or whatever it happens to be,
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.440]   and then they cross the border across from Mexico. And they can do that.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.600]   So what I'm saying, though, is that you shouldn't do that if you're listening to me.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.960]   Because once you're in the United States – sorry, to make the point – in flying to the United
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:26.120]   States, the U.S. uses that visa system to restrict the access of immigrants, potential immigrants.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:33.400]   But they're not doing it with U.S. border officials. Yeah, there's immigration officials
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.040]   at the airport, but they're doing it with airline employees. The airline employees won't let you
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.920]   board the plane if you don't have the appropriate visa. So they're using a system like that to keep
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:48.360]   you out. Now, the same system applies inside the United States, is that the United States won't
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.960]   penalize you as an illegal immigrant for working if you don't have work authorization. They will
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:00.520]   penalize your employer for hiring you, and the penalties can be steep. And so what the Immigration
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:05.720]   and Customs Enforcement Agency does is they do some high-profile raids routinely, and they basically
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.360]   instill fear in employees. And so if you go to the United States, you're not going to find that it's
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.800]   a land of flowing with milk and honey. You're going to find that you have very limited employment
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:22.920]   opportunities if you don't have proper employment authorization with a genuine immigrant visa
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:27.560]   opportunity. You have very limited employment opportunities. And then when you pass into those
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:32.200]   limited employment opportunities, you are going to be taken advantage of, broadly speaking,
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:39.240]   and you're going to be abused. Because unethical employers who are willing to hire undocumented
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:45.000]   workers know that they can get away with greater forms of abuse than if they are hiring documented
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.920]   workers. And while all people have legal rights in the United States, you will be very embarrassed
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:59.000]   to exercise those rights due to your status of non-belonging. When I'm in the United States,
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.640]   I can throw my weight around freely. A cop walks up to me on the street, asks me questions.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.400]   I turn to him and say, "Officer, I don't answer questions." When I pass through immigration in
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.240]   the United States – this didn't turn out well one time, but I did it. I did it.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:17.640]   When I travel to the United States and an immigration official starts asking me questions
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:22.360]   about where I've been, I just say, "I'm sorry, officer. I don't answer questions." And I can
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:27.640]   routinely throw my weight around because I'm confident not only in my citizenship status,
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:35.000]   but I'm confident in my knowledge of the culture, my knowledge of the law. I know what laws the
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.680]   police are under, et cetera. When you travel as an illegal immigrant to the United States
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:45.560]   and you're interacting with a police officer, you will have none of that confidence because
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:49.960]   the structure of legal requirements in the United States is very different than where you're from,
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:54.520]   and you're going to feel extremely vulnerable. So you feel vulnerable to everybody, which makes
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.240]   you slower to go for help, which means that when somebody robs your house or steals your cash or
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.880]   whatever it is that they take from you, you don't go and file a police report because you're scared
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.520]   of them calling ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. You're worried about how the
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.960]   cops are going to treat you. You're worried about all this stuff, and so you live your life as a
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:18.040]   second-class citizen. This is true even if you have linguistic skills, and unfortunately, you
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:23.480]   probably don't. Well, I guess if you're listening to the show, you do. But there's a lot of people
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:28.360]   who get abused because they don't learn the language, and so they wind up living in a
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:35.800]   completely different reality. And can it work? Sure, it can work. It's just really, really brutal.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.920]   And all across the United States, this is true. And so you're going to be a second-class citizen,
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.960]   and it's not going to be fun. It might be better than where you're from. If I were a Venezuelan,
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:51.000]   I would be in the United States as an illegal immigrant, doing everything I could to feed my
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.200]   family back home, sending money back home on remittances, and doing everything I could to
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:00.280]   get my family with me. Not a question in my mind. If I were from Haiti, I would absolutely have gone
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:05.160]   in through Brazil. I would have emigrated up across the Darien Gap. I would absolutely have
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.440]   gone to the United States as an illegal alien. Absolutely no question in my mind that I would do
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:16.120]   that. But that's if you have any kind of professional capacity. If you're understanding
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:21.240]   the words that I'm speaking to you right now as whatever we're, an hour and 20 minutes into a very
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:28.680]   detailed, very kind of high-level philosophical conversation in English, then you shouldn't do
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:33.080]   this because you'll have better opportunities elsewhere. And if you come to the United States,
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.200]   you have to come on a legal pathway so that you can have some chance of things working out in the
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:44.280]   long run. I have known a few people who have made it in the United States as illegal aliens and then
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.760]   went abroad. I have some friends of mine who lived in the United States. They lived there for about
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.160]   15 years. They invested in real estate in the United States. They became wealthy.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.560]   They little by little got their money, about three-quarters of a million dollars or about
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.600]   half a million dollars, their life savings that they made primarily with real estate investment.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:07.480]   They little by little got it out of the country, and then they left the United States, moved abroad
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.320]   where they did have citizenship status, and basically they're barred from ever going to
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.480]   the United States again. That's the best I can imagine. That does not happen frequently,
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.240]   and so I don't think people should take this pathway to the United States.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.720]   If you're in the United States illegally, I'm going to give you here the same advice that I've
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:30.200]   given, is that I think you're wasting your time. Unless you are a very low-level worker, which
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.720]   you're not because you're listening to me right now for all the reasons I said,
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:39.400]   then you're wasting your time in the United States. And this insecurity and sitting around
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.840]   and waiting, you're going to wait another decade to wait on some political change that somehow
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.400]   they're going to pass a bill that gives amnesty to illegal immigrants or to the children of illegal
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:56.280]   immigrants, et cetera. I see no way that happens in the next decade. Too polarized, and both camps
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.760]   in the political system, they're not willing to listen to each other. Could some kind of
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:08.680]   compromise bill be worked out? Like I said, would I myself vote, if I'm in Congress, would I vote for
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.080]   a bill that gives open borders and automatic amnesty to all illegal immigrants in the United
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:19.480]   States in exchange for ending the welfare state? I would. I'd vote for that. And it's laughable to
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:25.480]   think that that has any chance of happening in the next 10 years. We've all got our heels dug in way
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.600]   too deep on any of this stuff. And so remember, I'm out here in, I don't think it's philosophical
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.160]   la-la land, but it's purely philosophical what I'm saying. It has zero practical impact.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.720]   There's no feasible structure in which any kind of this thing happens. And that's why my entire
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:49.240]   life as a paying attention to politics, since about mid-90s, it's been exactly the same thing,
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.000]   a never-ending debate, and nothing changes about it, because the positions are too locked in.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.920]   The Republicans have decided to be the anti-immigration party. They couch it in rule
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:08.280]   of law. That's why we're opposed to amnesty bills, and we're not going to institute meaningful
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.000]   immigration reform. And the Democrats have dug in their heels and are unwilling to listen to
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.120]   any Republicans' concerns on any issue. And so they just fight, and they fight, and they fight,
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.400]   and they fight. And the government is impotent. So when you stay in the United States in that
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:29.640]   status, you're not going to get ahead the way you could if you went back home, wherever you have
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:35.080]   legal status, and started over again. And if you've got money, then use that money to restart
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.240]   yourself with legal status somewhere where you can use money to buy yourself a residency visa,
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:45.160]   buy yourself a citizenship, et cetera, and start over. America is no longer a country. America,
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.360]   the ideal, has spread around the world. And there are a lot of places outside of the United States
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.560]   that are far more American, even in the country of my birth. And so we're living in the age of
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.240]   digital revolution, digital connectivity, and you don't have to be in the United States to make it
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.960]   rich. If you're listening to my voice, you have the skills to succeed in any corner of the world.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.000]   And so if I were in the United States under that status, and I were no longer kind of the
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.080]   penniless immigrant who just had nothing but manual labor to offer the world,
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.120]   then I would make as much money as I could in a short period of time, and I would make a plan for
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.480]   a new place to go where I could exercise that, and I would go there, because I'm convinced that
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.120]   there's plenty of opportunity around the world for smart, intelligent people, even to access the U.S.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.840]   economy without being physically there and spending your life in limbo. And now the final point I
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:44.040]   want to make, and this is where it gets very financial. Recognize always that your security
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:53.080]   matters more than anything else. If you do not feel secure, and if you are not actually secure,
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.440]   you're going to spend all your money to try to get security.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.360]   So if you're living in a neighborhood right now, and you don't have, and there's crime increasing
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.960]   in your area, and you haven't figured out how to get your police department to do their job,
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.920]   etc., you need to move to a gated neighborhood. You need to start spending more money on your
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:15.240]   security. You need to get guards on your block. You need to increase your security. You need to
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.520]   start changing your living patterns so that you yourself are not, don't face a crime wave.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:28.600]   I'll skip some of the many stories I could say, but recognize this as your primary priority.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:34.600]   If you do not have economic opportunities where you live, recognize that this is going to be a
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:40.520]   primary thing. And so you want to make sure that you're never put in a situation of being
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:46.360]   an illegal immigrant. And so cultivate the economic opportunities that you have,
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.560]   and then cultivate some more for your children in other places. This is one of those things why I
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.680]   did my international stuff. Looking at a country that seems to be unraveling at the seams,
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:02.920]   optimistically, I hope that we can pull it together. I hope it's just a temporary
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:09.960]   time of difficulty, but I don't live my life on hope. Hopium is dumb. I live my life on plans,
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.920]   and so make some backup plans for other places that can be gone to, et cetera. And recognize,
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.200]   don't ever allow yourself to be in a situation which you can't feed your family.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:25.240]   About half of the audience, when I said a few minutes ago that, you know, if I were from Haiti,
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.960]   I would absolutely go to the United States as an illegal immigrant, you probably sucked your breath
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:34.600]   in. "Joshua, I thought he was a conservative guy. Why wouldn't he obey the rule of law?"
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:41.160]   Are you telling me that you would obey a stupid law saying where you can and can't go
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:48.200]   if your children are dying of starvation? I mean, most of us would become thieves,
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.000]   only a tiny percentage of us. I would love to think, I would hope that I'm in that percentage,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.280]   but I'm not that confident in my own ability to not even be a thief. We would steal to feed
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:07.000]   our children, let alone some imaginary lion on sand saying you can or can't work. First of all,
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.720]   I have no moral repercussions about it. I encourage illegal immigrants in the United States to work
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:17.480]   without any fear of failure, because what's the alternative to work? Stealing? You're going to
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:24.360]   force a man to be a thief because you won't let him work? Who would ever grant a government the
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:32.200]   right to say that you can or cannot work? I'm somehow supposed to not be able to work to feed
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:41.000]   myself and feed my family? I'm not going to go out into the marketplace and voluntarily negotiate
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.680]   with people for wages for a day's labor so that I can have food and a place to live and a safe
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:53.560]   place to be at night out of the cold? That's an insane law, and immoral laws should be disrespected
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:58.520]   and disobeyed because they are immoral. And so immigration restrictions on a man's right to work,
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:05.400]   etc., should be disobeyed by all people because they're immoral. You don't have the right to tell
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.760]   a man that he can't work. That's like the flip side of the immorality of slavery. You neither
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:16.840]   have the right to steal a man's labor from him by enslaving him, nor do you have the right to steal
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:21.640]   a man's ability to labor by passing a law saying that he can't work. Both of those are immoral,
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:26.520]   and they're wrong. A man has the right to go out into the world, make a voluntary free exchange
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.680]   with someone of labor for income in whatever form it takes. Now, the government can make
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.440]   it difficult, and they can pass, you know, do that stuff. But my point is that put yourself
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.000]   in that situation. If those are your convictions, you say, "No, I would obey the law, and I wouldn't
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.680]   go where it's illegal for me to go." Put yourself in that situation. Do you really mean to say that
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:50.440]   you would not work if your family were in need, if you were suffering violence where you're from?
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:58.520]   Of course you would. And then the third thing is just recognize how a country can change.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:05.720]   The country of the United States today is not the country of my birth, and so your country also can
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:10.600]   change. If you're listening to me from France, there's a good chance that you look around and
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:16.920]   say, "The nation of my birth is not the nation of today." And change is going to happen. I prefer
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.400]   to embrace it. I want to embrace it, but I also want to recognize that sometimes change can get
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.480]   out of hand, and it may not go in the direction that you want it to go. And so as a sovereign
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:30.120]   individual, you owe it to yourself to be prepared to thrive in any kind of circumstance, and that's
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.440]   what you can do. So cede to your physical safety. Live in a safe place. If you're living in a
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:38.680]   dangerous neighborhood, move. If you're living in a dangerous city, move. If you're living in
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:43.560]   a place where you don't have economic opportunity, move. Because at the end of the day, it's this
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:49.480]   kind of physical movement really is one of the few things that governments ever listen to, and
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:54.520]   that's what's happening in the immigration scenario. So I would assume that I've said enough
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:00.840]   in this show to find some area of agreement with you and some area of disagreement with you. And
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:06.840]   I think that this show probably still, if it's not too much personal finance in this particular
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:11.640]   episode, at least we can reclaim the moniker of radical, at least in some of these things.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:16.200]   I fully acknowledge that these are interesting philosophical discussions. I don't have any
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:22.200]   practical application of any of this other than what I have ended the show with. I can't tell
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.680]   you how to vote. I don't want to vote for Republicans or Democrats. I understand if you
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:31.320]   vote for a likely Republican candidate, Donald Trump, I understand. I get you. You don't have
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.600]   to defend it to me. If you vote for a likely Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, I understand.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:41.720]   You don't have to defend it to me. If you vote for someone else or you don't vote at all, I
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:47.560]   understand. I don't have any kind of practical Democratic outworking of this for reasons that
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.760]   are probably obvious at this point in time. I can't tell you any way that I see this resolving.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:58.040]   Someone else's crystal ball may work better than mine, but to me, these things are just too far
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:04.920]   removed to see much change. And while people can change on some things, I only see it happening
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:11.160]   kind of if there's a philosophical imperative. And as I see it, most people are stuck on the
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:16.120]   horns of a dilemma caused by their own philosophy. So the Republicans – I don't need to go into
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.680]   politics. You get it. But the point is, we're on the horns of a dilemma, and we can't – these
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:26.680]   things are irreconcilable. And so my best guess of the future is that basically we muddle along
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:34.600]   until we see something happen. So my guess is that no political change is really going to happen
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:41.480]   on immigration, but I think the flow of immigrants is going to dry up. The world of Latin America
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:47.160]   just probably doesn't have that many young people to contribute anymore. And anybody who wants to
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.840]   immigrate to the United States using this cross-border crossing is probably there by now,
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:34:01.560]   or at least is on the way. And so that process of flying from Uganda to Brazil and then walking and
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:07.960]   bussing your way up, that's a multi-month process, but it's not a two-year process. And so I don't
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:13.560]   expect an enormous horde of immigrants to continue. I think that what you're seeing right now is
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.480]   whatever was pent-up demand caused by various issues, and it's probably about at its limit.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:24.440]   And so I would expect – and it's just my best guess. We'll put it here in public so I can come
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.000]   back and check on this in five or ten years. But my best guess is that it'll probably just die down.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.880]   Maybe it'll be a political movement for a while, but there's not going to be any significant
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.800]   resolution. The U.S. Congress basically seems incapable of legislating anymore,
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.320]   even on important issues where they should be legislating. And so
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:48.840]   gridlock it is. And as Gary North himself was fond to say, "Highlight gridlock,
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.120]   because at least they don't get in my way." I don't think it's always good, but
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:57.640]   unfortunately that's the situation. And people will continue to be upset about things, and then
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:05.160]   probably 15 years from now, most of this will have kind of slid into the dustbin of history,
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:11.560]   kind of like duck and cover and Russian spies and all the propaganda of the past as well. That'd be
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.080]   my best guess on what happens. In the meantime, you got to see to yourself, you got to see to
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:21.000]   your family, and you got to make good decisions so that you don't wind up in a vulnerable situation.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.480]   I would just simply say, I guess what I would prefer to share my heart on in a closing manner is
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:43.560]   this. Laws that exist do not need to affect your personal actions. And I would beg you, if there
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:49.480]   are immigrants near you, especially illegal immigrants, especially recent illegal immigrants,
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:58.200]   please help them. These men, primarily men, some women, but these people face enormous
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:05.160]   difficulties in life. You have no concept of the world in which these men live.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:09.720]   I was talking to a friend of mine recently who worked in an airport, and he was telling me about
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:15.800]   the African guys who work at a lot of the airports across the United States.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:21.400]   And he didn't have much money, had to fly recently, and he said to me in passing he
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.440]   had to go sleep in the airport before an early morning flight. He said, "Well, I just went and
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.800]   found all the African guys and laid down with them." And basically, as he told me the story
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:35.240]   from his experience, is that you have all these guys from Africa, at least the ones around him,
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:41.080]   all these guys come over from Africa. They get a job working at the airport. Usually they get two
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:46.200]   jobs on two different shifts, so an early morning shift with one restaurant and a late afternoon
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:54.760]   shift with another. They live at the airport. At night, generally speaking, they don't go home
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.480]   because they don't really have a home. They're here by themselves. Their family is back home.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.160]   And they work these two jobs, and they go and they sleep in the airport every night and then go to
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:10.760]   work. And then when they have a day off, there's usually one apartment that somebody has rented
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.760]   that's basically the apartment. And they go to the apartment, they lay down a sleeping bag,
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:19.800]   and sleep next to whoever happens to be off that day. And you have 30 guys who will sleep
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:26.600]   at that apartment when there is a day off. And I just want you to imagine you living that
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:36.680]   lifestyle. I want you to imagine yourself being that guy. Imagine you've got a wife and children
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:42.680]   at home. You've moved across the world. You're working a fairly low-paying wage.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.720]   Thankfully, it's decent financial planning for those guys in the sense that they've basically
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:53.960]   limited every expense except food. They wind up spending an enormous amount of money on food
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.040]   because they have to buy all their food from the airport concessions, which is high-priced,
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.720]   and then generally unhealthy, which of course creates health issues. But other than that,
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.000]   they've limited all their other expenses. So, they can send significant amounts of money home
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.160]   to support their wife and their children with the dream of being reunited with them someday.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:17.480]   But just imagine you're living that lifestyle. Imagine that you're working two eight-hour jobs,
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:22.760]   working 16 hours a day, and that you sleep on an airport floor, on an airport bench in a little
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:29.080]   corner back in the middle of nowhere at night. What would you give for somebody to come along
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:36.360]   and give you an encouraging word? What would you give to be invited to someone's, you know,
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.800]   Thanksgiving dinner? What would you give for someone to help you to connect with the culture
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.800]   that you're living in but not really living in? What would you give for a friend? What would you
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:54.600]   give for someone to invite you to church? What would you give to make a difference in someone's
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.880]   lives? The fact that someone has crossed a border does not make anyone less human,
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.680]   any more than the fact that someone has stolen a loaf of bread
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:13.640]   makes them less deserving of care and consideration. Go back and I would say read,
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:21.000]   but it's a hard book to read. Watch Les Mis by Victor Hugo for one of the ultimate wrestlings
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:31.240]   with this. Go and read Count of Monte Cristo, my favorite novel. Go and deal with these situations,
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.400]   and don't harden your heart to people just because you think, "Well, that guy doesn't
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.920]   deserve my love and attention because he doesn't speak my language," etc.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:48.680]   I would assume that there's probably, I don't know, who knows, maybe there's 50 terrorists
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.520]   who have come into the United States. There probably are. I don't have any idea.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:40:00.680]   But every single immigrant that I have interacted with personally on a personal basis in the United
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:08.360]   States has been the kind of man that I would be proud to have as my neighbor, and I think you
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:15.800]   would too. Don't let language barriers stand in your way. Learn Spanish and go and practice it
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.280]   on immigrants. Learn Somali if you're in Minnesota, and go and get to know your Somalian neighbors.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:33.800]   These people who are immigrants to the United States are abused, broadly speaking, by society
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.960]   because of their second-class status, and you have the opportunity to change that.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:45.720]   And it's actually really fun. A number of years ago, my wife and I hosted, we have some friends
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:52.120]   who are Nigerian immigrants to the United States, and we hosted them for Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:59.480]   and it was super fun because here we are as the born-and-bred Americans making Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.440]   Nigerians don't have a clue about Thanksgiving dinner. They don't know
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:09.320]   anything about it. And I've got, I think it was three Nigerian families. I've got 16,
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:17.560]   something like 15 or 16 Nigerians all packed into this little apartment. We hosted it at our
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:22.680]   friend's apartment. So you've got Joshua and his wife and family. We're the only white people in
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:28.200]   the place. Every other one of them is longing for their, I forget what they call it, their
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:31.880]   traditional bean dish. I forget the name that they use for it. But they're longing for their
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:37.240]   own food while I'm carving the turkey and showing them the mashed potatoes and the gravy and
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:45.400]   everything. And it's just so fun to share that stuff. And these are the experiences that you're
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:50.280]   missing out on if you don't go and engage with your neighbors. I know I'm preaching at you,
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:57.240]   but I beg you that go and engage. And this is one of the things I have an enormous bone to pick
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:09.800]   with my generally Republican and conservative groups from which I primarily issue. It's that
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:19.080]   it's amazing to me how opposed many Republicans are to Latin American immigrants is that most of
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:24.600]   these people are the exact kinds of people that you say that you want in your country.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:33.800]   For example, what kind of man gets up, travels for months with nothing,
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.560]   sleeping on the street corner to go to a place that he can go and get a job?
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:43.960]   What kind of man braves the terrors of the Darien Gap?
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:51.240]   I have spent a lot of time talking with immigrants who have walked through the Darien Gap. I've spent
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:43:01.800]   a lot of time feeding people who are sleeping on the street. You want these people as your neighbors
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:07.720]   because they are men and women who are determined to build a better future.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:14.600]   That's why they're going through this hell of leaving their families and going elsewhere.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:25.160]   In addition, a huge percentage of them are extremely Christian, extremely conservative.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.280]   If they're not Christian, they're at least broadly religious, which is
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   a much easier place to start than people who don't care. And they're coming to you.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:44.280]   They're coming to be your neighbor, to be your co-worker, to sit in your church pew with you,
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:50.200]   etc. And I just beg you, you don't have to solve any of these political issues. As I see it,
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.800]   they're insoluble. But you do have a responsibility to love your neighbor and to work with them.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.480]   Now, love of neighbor primarily starts with those closest to you. Only a fool would say
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.880]   that you owe the same duty of care to an unknown guy on the other side of the world as you do
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.400]   for your own son in your home or your literal next-door neighbor. Obviously, there's a variation.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.880]   But if God privileges you and brings a community of immigrants across your path,
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.480]   go and get involved and help them, hire them into your company, help them get established,
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.840]   have some language courses, invite them to your church, etc. And what you'll find is that there's
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.480]   an energy and there's an enthusiasm there that you're missing in your daily life.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:35.240]   I love immigrants to the United States because they get rich like four times faster than Americans
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:41.560]   do. They work harder. They get rich faster, etc. And this is basically a self-selection bias.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.080]   It's not, in my opinion, that there's anything fundamentally different about somebody from one
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:52.200]   country or another. But it's the fact that the people who are coming are coming because they
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.120]   want something different. They want something better. That's the only reason you leave your
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:01.400]   family. That's the only reason that you leave your community. That's the only reason you leave what
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:07.160]   you know to go to something unknown. It's because you want something better. And this is probably
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.360]   going to turn out to be a huge competitive advantage for the United States in years to come.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:17.320]   If we can get over some of the social instability, if we can make sure that we lock up all the
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:25.720]   criminals and deal with them in a strong way and get rid of them, then it's going to be an enormous
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.280]   benefit because it's going to bring youthful enthusiasm. And in all the previous waves of
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.640]   immigration to the United States, you've seen the same cycle play out again and again and again.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:41.720]   So this is a personal plea to you is get involved wherever you have opportunity. Get to know your
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.280]   neighbors. Welcome them to the country. Make friends with them. Invite them to Thanksgiving
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:52.760]   dinner. It's super fun. You're going to enjoy it. And you'll have an opportunity to affect
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.480]   the future of someone's family in a really powerful way. Thank you for listening. I
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:03.480]   appreciate it. I'll be back with more distinctly personal finance content very soon.
