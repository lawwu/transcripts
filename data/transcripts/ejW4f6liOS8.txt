[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   My body is a wonderland.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.080]   If that wonderland is white, soft and mushy.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.640]   Sure.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.340]   And hairy too.
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.620]   You know, the worst thing about skin on skin sleeping with the newborn is that,
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.380]   you know, sometimes she roots and she goes after the man, the male nip.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.860]   I know.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.560]   Problem is my nipples covered in hair.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.020]   It's really awkward for everybody.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.260]   She start gagging.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.120]   I'll tell Tali that story when she's 18 or at her wedding.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.820]   It'll be even better.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.720]   All in.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.960]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.840]   Rain man, David Sack.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.700]   I'm doing all in.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.460]   And it said.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.600]   We open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.220]   Love you guys.
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.920]   Queen of Kinwa.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   I'm doing all in.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.960]   Hey everybody.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.480]   Welcome to another episode of the all in podcast.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.400]   I am wearing a blue shirt.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   I am a pasty white old Greek man who's balding and obnoxious.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.960]   And, uh, with me today is, uh, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.400]   My pronouns.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.180]   My pronouns are beep beep.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.560]   And most people just call me a jerk with me today.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.220]   Of course is my Sri Lankan Oracle looking wearing a furry sweater.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.160]   Hello everybody.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.200]   My name is Chamath.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.260]   I have a salt and pepper, black hair, brown eyes, uh, black hair, uh, black eyes.

[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.200]   And I'm wearing a black shirt.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.120]   Um, I'm wearing.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.040]   Uh, I am tall, uh, six foot two.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.620]   I go by the pronouns.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.360]   We King and stud muffin.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.900]   And, uh, uh, I'm here to talk to you about, uh, internet security protocols.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.900]   Wah, wah, wah, wah.

[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.440]   I think people should just come up and say, well, I don't look like the closest.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.540]   Like, I don't look like Urkel.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.660]   I look like a Bollywood.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.520]   When you put your glass, I'm like the Sri Lankan article to us.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.840]   Welcome to the all in podcast.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.160]   guess two out of the four of us are canceled next up for cancellation sax yes i'm coming to
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.120]   you here from the floor of the new york stock exchange which was once land that belonged to
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:17.920]   the mojico and the montauk the oneida the erie and the iroquois tribes oh we're all here since time
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.440]   didn't you went for it sax i love you i'm isn't it important that we at any moment
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.160]   that we're successful we have to flagellate ourselves and remind ourselves
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.600]   that at one time all this land was owned by somebody else we stole it also the greeks
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:54.160]   conquered the romans but you forgot to mention you're also wearing a brother shirt that is
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.520]   four sizes too large this is my slim fit so that slim fit oh no here we go again sax has been
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   upgrading the wardrobe he's changing wait wait before freebird does the intro uh jay
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.120]   kyle you want to tell them why we're we're doing these intros like this yeah i gotta
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.440]   pause before our kids okay yesterday on the internet emerged a series of videos that were
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.320]   clipped of microsoft presenting their new suite of developer tools yada yada and corporate people
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.720]   and the internet was like oh my god this is crazy woke ism like what what is happening here this
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.280]   no i thought it was a skit i thought it was a saturday night and so right and so then as soon
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.800]   as they got called out by the entire internet they claimed that they were doing this for visually
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.960]   impaired people which kind of begs the question of why visually impaired people need to be able to
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   do this and so they're doing this for visually impaired people and they're doing this for
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.280]   people who are visually impaired and they're doing this for people who are visually impaired
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.480]   and they're doing this for people who are visually impaired and they're doing this for people who are
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   visually impaired and they're doing this for people who are visually impaired and they're doing this
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.600]   for people who are visually impaired and they're doing this for people who are visually impaired
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.200]   people need to know what race you are like it's still playing into this like crazy weight race
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.400]   consciousness but then on top of it it wasn't just that we we know it's not that because then they
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.720]   start doing this no no but hold on yeah also if you if you're blind and technically can't see
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.440]   you may not even know what blue means because you will have never seen the color blue or blonde
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.080]   okay right right but they were also identifying their races which kind of begs the question of
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.400]   why that's important but if you were born blind you would not know what that means either you're
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.960]   literally colorblind people have explained to people putting you on the same footing as people
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   who are not visually impaired i'm saying i'm saying if you're visually impaired you're using
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.400]   the wrong language that language is for the sighted people okay but i i'm just calling
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.480]   on their stated explanation that it has anything to do with visually impaired because
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.240]   then they went on to basically recite the names of 10 tribes native american tribes that no one's
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.320]   ever heard of on on which the microsoft campus used to belong to so which is why i was kind
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.440]   of making fun of that in my initial statement but so look this is just woke capitalism this is
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.680]   wokeism out of control obviously they didn't see the election results
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   earlier in the week it's clearly there was some level of virtue signaling i think in their defense
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.520]   they were trying to do it i think for the visually impaired the problem was they didn't explain the
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   context and they didn't give instructions to the people on what to do so the people came out but
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.240]   jay cal that video that was a clip pulled out of a broader context here right so like apparently
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.640]   this is common on campus or common there that this is happening all over so we just know it
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.120]   isn't common because i asked people online well it was optional it was optional it's optional
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.960]   apparently to the common point i think the reason the internet reacted the way it was was i asked
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.920]   every single person who came at me because the woke left came at me i just said can you show me
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.960]   another clip of this on youtube of any event where this occurred and nobody could so i think this was
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   kind of a first when did you stop being a member of that woke left jcal i've never liked the
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.160]   historical side i've never liked the historical side i've never liked the historical side i've never
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   been for bernie i've never been for elizabeth ward i've always been moderate always wait can
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.360]   i hear freberg's intro yeah freberg can we hear yours my identity is an illusion it's an illusion
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.920]   created by the viewer and you can call me whatever you want i sit on the ground where during the
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   haitian period there was lava and magma and nothing but co2 and methane and i represent those gases
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.080]   that are now lost to the oxygenation and the cyanobacteria that swarmed over this earth and
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.200]   took everything over and led to the formation of eukaryotic life and here we all sit today in our
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.880]   privileged existence thank you are you saying that you want to freberg is just electrons hitting
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.760]   neurons in interesting ways yeah i know he's like exactly he's like it is his pronouncer his
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:44.480]   pronouns are proton and dark matter biochemical quantum bath quantum foam is my pronoun so would
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.000]   you like to formally apologize for colonizing the dark matter during the big bang now
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.360]   or would you like to i feel it was inappropriate it wasn't fair when the cyanobacteria took over the
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.760]   the face of the earth and sucked up all the co2 and created all the oxygen and and for that we all
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:10.560]   apologize for the genocide of the for the genocide of of co2 and methane i mean those molecules were
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.920]   really happy and they had a you know they had a very kind of like peaceful existence on this earth
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.120]   and you know cyanobacteria just came in and ripped it away
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.200]   just took it all away from there and you know and then the offspring ended up being us and here we
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:34.480]   are so apologies all right all right welcome to episode 54. everybody's canceled the final episode
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.120]   everybody's horrible i don't think that the microsoft thing was bad when you hear the
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.880]   broader context it was like you know that's just you know i think it's a reasonable thing that
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.840]   visually impaired people i'm still absurd i'm still long microsoft and google and short the rest of
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.560]   big tech so i'm fine with it there you go back to the stock price i actually i i do you think that
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.600]   the google long netflix short play is the right play i think the best i think the best trade on
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.760]   the best trade on the internet the most obvious simple money making trade is long microsoft google
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.600]   short big tech the rest of the big tech short ibm short netflix no no no no no no no no meaning
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.720]   you can you can very comfortably short apple facebook amazon netflix and be long microsoft
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.760]   google so as a spread trade right right it's the most it's the best risk parity trade on the
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.920]   internet right now i mean period in the markets can you explain explain the spreadsheet so look
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.120]   look i i tweeted this a while ago but it's like and and again the i i think like
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.240]   well let me be constructive and say the people on twitter that respond to these
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.280]   threads are not totally stupid although i think they're kind of idiotic um i said you know here's
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.760]   how you can effectively you know i said something about you know big tech and i said oh i can
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.880]   comfortably put my short on and i'm kind of trolling people when i do that because i'm not
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.320]   full trade and the real trade whenever you put anything on, in my opinion, is all about
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.800]   managing risk and the best thing about the internet and the stock market is that when
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.860]   you're betting on internet stocks, you don't necessarily have to be naked long or naked
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.620]   short which comes with a lot more risk than if you were long one security and short another
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.620]   against it.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.960]   For example, over the last ten years, you would have made a lot of money by being long
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.040]   Amazon and short a basket of traditional commerce companies, offline commerce.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.460]   I'm going to make up a basket but Macy's, JCPenney, Kmart, Sears, right?
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.920]   If you were short those and long Amazon, that's what's called a spread trade.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.660]   You're basically playing the gap between your longs and your shorts.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.020]   It's independent of where the market generally trades is one of the key points.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.020]   Irrelevant of the market.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.020]   You're basically saying-
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.200]   Because those stocks could go up but just not anywhere near Amazon.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.940]   Everything could go up, right.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.280]   Right.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.460]   When you put that trade on, for example, I'm going to bet that if everything goes up, Amazon
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.920]   will go up more than Kmart, Walmart, Sears.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.660]   If the stock market goes down, Amazon won't go down that much but these ones will go down
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.660]   a lot.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.760]   You're playing the spread.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.400]   Just to be very explicit, there was a very, and I talked about this last week, but this
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.440]   idea wasn't mine.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.540]   It's a borrowed trade from somebody who's a very well-known hedge fund manager who put
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.920]   it on.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.940]   It's a massive size.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.160]   To be honest, not knowing much of anything, I just copied it.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.200]   His initial trade was long Google, short Facebook.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.540]   That trade basically was at parity which meant that the long and the short canceled each
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.100]   other out for about the last four years.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.500]   Until the last year, it completely blew out and it returned about 80%, 85%.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.600]   If you had put $100 in, you would have made about 85 bucks on this trade by being long
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.800]   Google, short Facebook.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.520]   The bigger trade at scale is actually long Google and Microsoft and short the rest of
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.740]   big tech.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.340]   There's a lot of vagaries why that this idea makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.160]   What you're saying is they'll outperform the other basket of tech.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.240]   On a relative basis.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   On a relative basis.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.920]   It's not like you're saying Airbnb can't go up or Facebook can't go up.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   It could.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.280]   It's not going to go up as much as those other two.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.820]   He's saying the trillion dollar market cap companies, not the Airbnb's.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.780]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:21.160]   The reason why focusing there makes sense is they're hyper liquid markets.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.700]   They have tremendous ways in which you can have massive size on.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.920]   You could put a trade of 10 billion long versus 10 billion short.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.400]   You can put mega size on these things if you have real conviction.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.160]   The third thing is when the banks look at that kind of position, they actually, from
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.980]   a risk management perspective, treat it differently than if you were just naked long any one of
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.760]   these things.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.540]   Naked long would be just making one bet.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.760]   Or naked short, which is even more dangerous.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.640]   Because if the market collapses by 30%, both stocks might go down 30 roughly, but one will
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.000]   go down 32 and the other one will go down 28.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And so you're really only exposed-
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   You're down 2%.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.060]   2% as opposed to the 30%.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.200]   So all the market risk is taken out when you make trades like that.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.180]   The reason it's possible also today to do so at such a scale, right Chamath, is interest
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.880]   rates are so low.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.640]   So when you borrow on margin to go long.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.320]   So if you're long, the rate is very low.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.880]   And when you short the stock, if it's a highly liquid stock, it doesn't cost a lot to borrow
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880]   to short.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.880]   That's right.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.740]   So your actual carrying cost on that trade ends up being pretty low relative to the upside
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.740]   you expect.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.580]   So just to give you a sense of it, when I tweeted that tweet out, to complete the picture,
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.940]   I was actually long something against my proposed short.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.460]   And I put it on in pretty meaningful leverage.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.620]   And it's worked out really well because I was playing the spread.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.620]   And I was like, "Oh, I'm going to do this."
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.620]   And I was like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.320]   search, they're inoculated. And so in many ways, Google is the
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.340]   safest. And it's also, as we've said before, the purest
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.700]   moneymaking machine on the internet,
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.240]   you're referring, of course, to Google paying Apple $10 billion
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.740]   to be correct, search in their own Android. So one platform and
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.340]   on the other platform, they they pay them so much that they're
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.940]   going to be always protected. And the second best company is
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.700]   Microsoft. And you we even saw it, by the way, this past week.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.040]   I don't know if you guys saw that, but Microsoft decided to
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.940]   broadside attack against notion. Yeah, that was a productivity
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.280]   app that's been growing very well. I felt this when I was on
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.180]   the board of slack, when Microsoft put its gun sights on
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.320]   us, we always thought that they could not out compete with us.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.420]   And what it turns out is, when you have a massive distribution
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.160]   advantage, feature parity is enough. And you can actually be
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.260]   slightly less than good enough on the features. Because
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.820]   distribution and bundling and packaging overpower a customer's
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.020]   desire to adopt a product. So in the case of slack,
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.420]   it was very difficult, I think, for us to compete against
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.060]   Microsoft's bundling of teams, with all this other software
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.220]   that they were selling, and all the discounting that they could
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.620]   do made it very difficult for us to compete because we had a
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.100]   single product. And lo and behold, 18 months later, the
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.160]   only real long term protective solution for slack shareholders
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.140]   was to basically get bought by Salesforce so that you could be
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.520]   part of a bigger whole. This past week, Microsoft decided to
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.640]   go after notion. And it's going to be I think, a very similar
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.540]   story where
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.300]   you know, once they decide to sort of go after this product
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.100]   experience, they only need to be 80% is good. And then the
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.440]   distribution and bundling and packaging will take care of the
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.200]   other 20%.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.800]   It doesn't kill the other company, but it creates headwinds
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.500]   that massive headwinds because because a company like notion
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.020]   cannot be fully valued over long periods of time simply being an
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.620]   SMB company, you at a minimum, you'll have to move into the mid
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.380]   market, you may necessarily never have to go to the
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.140]   enterprise. But you probably have to go to the mid market.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.940]   And in that is a very troublesome path.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.380]   Because Microsoft has so much, you know, 10x so many tentacles
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.780]   inside of those businesses. So anyways, basically the long
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.320]   Microsoft long Google is a pretty obvious kind of like
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   monopolistic, you know, pair trade, the question is, what do
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   you short against it, so that you can take up the market
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.360]   volatility and you can play spread. Again, Apple has severe,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.320]   you know, headwinds with respect to inflation pressures, and
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.280]   margins and supply chain issues. Amazon has pretty meaningful
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:26.780]   headwinds.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.320]   Now, relative to pricing power and competition. Facebook has
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.420]   pressure with respect to regulatory oversight.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.120]   I just came up with one. What about Airbnb versus the
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.940]   airline? You're talking about trade, you're talking about
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.860]   smaller rinky dink ideas.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.560]   I listen, I'm not playing the same chip stack issue. I wasn't
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.140]   there on Tuesday night. I'm on a Thursday night. So no, no, no,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.220]   be a good spread for me.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.980]   No, that's a stupid idea. And I'll tell you what, okay, if
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.540]   you're going to put these things on go to where the deepest
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.720]   liquid markets are, because those are the same things that
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.120]   are going to be in the market. And that's why I'm saying that
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.380]   those are the safest. Okay. Right? Like, like, don't try to
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.900]   be different. Being the same here.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.200]   Tell me why Airbnb, which is an incredible margin business
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.320]   that's incredibly well run and growing versus airlines, which
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.180]   are horribly run and low margin. Why wouldn't that be a good
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.180]   spread trade? I'm just thinking.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.820]   I think it's a very, very two, you're picking two random
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.580]   companies out of a hat.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.460]   Well, they're both in transportation and vacation and
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.560]   travel completely different businesses with completely
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:25.840]   different
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.180]   motivations with different capital pools with different
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.960]   people that own the stock. There's no point trying to get
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.760]   cute on these things. My point is, if you really want to be
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.080]   hedged against market risk, got it. Code of where it's safest.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.180]   Find the simplest, most obvious thing. Don't overthink it or
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.240]   don't put it on. So another obvious one, here's it. Here's
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.040]   it. So obvious is within big tech, figure out which ones you
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.960]   want to be long, which ones you want to be short. That's a
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.720]   spread trade that over the next four or five years where if you
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.820]   expect a lot of market volatility, it makes sense to
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.040]   maybe put some of this kind of stuff on right. A different
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.760]   version of this idea, which makes sense is in autos. Again,
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.920]   trillions of dollars of market cap. And you can make a
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.980]   decision. Do I want to be long, Tesla lucid and Rivian and short
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.660]   the traditional autos that could be a trade. You know, but trying
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.180]   to change like trying to go after like, let me pick Airbnb
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.060]   versus United Airlines is too random for me. And I don't think
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.700]   they're correlated.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.040]   enough for it to make any sense.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.440]   All right, speaking of the stock market, sacks, you've got the
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.040]   background of the New York Stock Exchange as your zoom background
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.420]   today. What's that about?
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:40.580]   Yeah, so bird listed on the New York Stock Exchange today. This
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.040]   is a company that I've been involved in pretty much since the
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.480]   beginning, we led the Series A round back in 2017. It was
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.320]   actually the first check I wrote as a VC to lead around at craft
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.960]   and four years later public company on the New York Stock
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.040]   Exchange. Pretty amazing.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.240]   And so you're literally at the New York Stock Exchange as we
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.400]   see the first remote bestie.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.680]   Yes. And you can see behind me. That is the floor of the New York
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.020]   Stock Exchange. It's not like, you know, if you've seen the
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.540]   movie trading places, it's not like that anymore. There are no
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.240]   stockbrokers. There's no like paper flying around. Got it. I'm
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.900]   not really sure what the purpose of all those monitors are down
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.160]   there. I feels to me a little bit like a movie set.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.020]   It's like a movie set. Yeah. And so people come here to record
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.920]   things. But as we all know, the all the trades are really
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.520]   happening inside giant machines.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.220]   Can you turn around and just start yelling Booyah Booyah
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.320]   security comes in?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.260]   No, I'm in I'm elevated above the floor. No one can really
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.140]   hear me. I'm in like this sort of broadcast booth.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.200]   So take us behind the decision to go public as a four year old
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:54.900]   company. We were expecting, you know, Airbnb, Ubers and Lyfts,
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.460]   took over 10 years to go public. Now here we are sitting on a
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.220]   four year old public company. Is that a good thing? A bad thing?
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.080]   Something in between? And how does the board and the management
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.460]   team make that decision to go public?
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.900]   I think it's a good thing. Because the company Well, the
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.640]   company wanted to I think it had the opportunity to it. It grew
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.680]   very, very quickly before COVID. Then you had COVID was like sort
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.400]   of a huge setback. They I mean, basically, the scooter industry
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.420]   to stop for at least six months because of lockdowns. But then
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.780]   coming out of COVID, they bounced back
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.620]   really strongly, they kind of pivoted their model to what's
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.040]   called a fleet manager model where basically they're putting
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.520]   a business in a box for a local operator or local entrepreneur
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.740]   to buy the scooters with financing and manage the fleet
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.560]   themselves. So it's a much more highly virtualized model. And so
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.140]   as a result of that in q2, they just did 60 million in revenue
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:53.520]   in the last quarter. And I think it was gross profit of something
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.120]   like 27%.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.940]   And it was had a loss of like 12 million. So they're very, very
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.500]   close to getting to profitability. And, you know,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.460]   companies only four years old, you know, it took Uber 12 years
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.420]   or whatever to get to be public. So it's been pretty, it's been a
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.280]   pretty amazing ride. There's been a lot of big ups and downs.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.160]   But so it's kind of a pretty sweet event.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.600]   Is it trading? I know it was switchback was like the SPAC
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.040]   name,
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.600]   right. So it's it today was the first day started trading under
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.540]   the ticker symbol BRDS.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:32.160]   I guess all birds took bi RD. So we took BRDS. And, you know,
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.580]   there's a total number of shares outstanding of I want to say
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:41.280]   roughly 300 million. So it's about a $2.4 billion market cap,
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.340]   you know, as it stands right now, which you know, for a
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.700]   Series A investors pretty great.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.720]   Really happy for you.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.900]   Sex. Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations. It's great.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.680]   Congrats, dude.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.740]   We heard last week Sequoia is going to do the Sequoia fund
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.420]   this evergreen fund, keep owning
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.920]   shares now as a VC. Do you distribute after four years of
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.340]   this investment and you made multiple investments? Or do you
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.880]   make the decision? Hey, we think it's undervalued, we have, you
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.380]   know, conviction in the company, we were going to be in it for 10
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.540]   years, or do you just take the quick win and give everybody
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.040]   their shares?
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.500]   Well, I've I'm going to ever agree to be on the board for the
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.680]   next year. So you know, I'm planning to do that. And are we
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.800]   have a traditional six month lockup. And so at that point,
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.300]   we'd have to make a decision about when or how many shares
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.060]   we're going to distribute, how much to distribute the shares.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.640]   And this is the first time we've been confronted with decision.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.580]   I mean, Kraft Ventures is only a four year old firm. And like I
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.420]   said, this is actually the first round that I led as a VC. So
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.940]   it's the first time we've been confronted with a distribution
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.660]   of this magnitude, we've had some smaller distributions. So
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.220]   yeah, we still have to make those decisions. We haven't
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.300]   decided yet what we're going to do.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.020]   If you if the stock is up, let's say, meaningfully in the next
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.780]   six months, and you get to that, you know, six months and a day
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.340]   and you have the ability to distribute,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.020]   you know, a hundred percent, and you're looking at it, business
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.260]   is thriving, you're on the board, do you consider holding
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.060]   for a year or two so that you can distribute at $16 $25 or
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.320]   whatever your price target is?
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.620]   Maybe we haven't got we haven't gotten to that point yet. So
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.760]   yeah, I mean, I guess what I would say is that our bias would
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.280]   be to distribute shares to our LPS, so that they can make their
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.060]   own decisions about whether they're told or not. As long as
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.820]   the stock is, you know, priced fairly, if for some reason, we
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.300]   thought it wasn't, then there'd be an additional reason to hold
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.800]   on to it and make the distribution later.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.280]   Jamal, what are your thoughts on this given it's come up before?
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.460]   And a number of us are going to be faced with this decision. And
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.060]   then we see Sequoia has got LP buy in for an evergreen fund.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.940]   Well, I think an evergreen fund is different from having to
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.600]   figure out how to do distributions. So they're
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.980]   solving for two different ideas. The evergreen fund is really good
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.400]   because
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.120]   you don't have to do this continual fundraising process.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.320]   And you can basically roll gains back into the next tranche of
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.820]   invested companies in an easier way. I like that idea. It was
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.620]   pretty rare at the time, I remember when I was starting
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.540]   social capital, the only fund that did it really well was
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.780]   Sutter Hill. And for a whole host of reasons, I decided to not do
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.820]   an evergreen fund. In hindsight, I think for me, that turned out
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.540]   to be better, because then it was easier for me to wind down
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.820]   and have a clear demarcation of
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:29.520]   when it was just myself and other LPS versus when it was just
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.580]   my capital. But there were some really good reasons to do it.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.920]   The hardest thing I think that Sequoia is going to find in this
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.200]   new iteration is at some point, somebody's reputation will be on
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.660]   the line for judging public equities. And it's still not
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.740]   clear to me that people who live in breathe venture can context
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.660]   switch well enough to
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.240]   then live and breathe public equity. So just the best example
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.340]   I would say is like Tiger Global, when you look inside
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.880]   that organization, which is incredibly well run, there are
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.300]   two superb investors that carve the universe up, right? You have
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.240]   Chase Coleman that runs a public book, and you have Scott
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.740]   Schleifer that runs a private book. What does it prove? To me,
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.200]   it proves that it's just very hard to find a person that can
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.600]   do both. And the context switching is very complicated. So
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.540]   maybe Sequoia finds an incredible public market strategist that
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.580]   can then manage these positions.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.480]   Otherwise, but they've done this for a few years, right?
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.840]   They've Sequoia, I don't know, people realize this, they set up
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.120]   an interest on the heritage fund, and they set it up with
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.600]   only GPS money, it's got billions under management, and
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.720]   it's been making late stage private but mostly public equity
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.380]   investing.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.080]   I know, but that's a fund of funds. What I'm saying is, I'll
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.960]   be very honest with you, if I was an LP of Sequoia, I would
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.420]   want the money back. And the reason is, I'm not sure that
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.460]   Sequoia can compound
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.880]   money in the public markets anywhere near what I could. So
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.080]   do you buy the point that they make that like, exiting some of
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.340]   these left most of the, you know, kind of value creation on
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:03.780]   the table?
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.960]   No, I think what they're saying something much more subtle,
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.600]   which is they exited, and they have regrets for selling, you
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.240]   have to remember, when Sequoia distributed Google, every single
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.200]   partner got Google shares. Now, had they held those shares, they
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.300]   wouldn't be saying any of this. And famously, I'll tell you when
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.560]   I should they held their shares.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.020]   I actually do.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.160]   Fair enough. But maybe they did. Maybe they didn't. But let's
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.360]   just let's just put it out there that, for example, I know
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.060]   explicitly, when I almost merged social capital with Kleiner
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.020]   Perkins, like six years ago, I spent so much time with John
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.480]   door, the most incredible thing that I was so impressed with
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.980]   door was he was he told me, he had never sold a single share of
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.400]   Amazon that was distributed to him. And he had only sold a
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.840]   handful of shares of Google, only to fund future capital
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   requirements of Kleiner at the time.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.560]   So I just think that ultimately, I think probably what
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   Sequoia was saying is, man, I wish I had not sold my Google
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.600]   shares when they were distributed to me. Because
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.100]   otherwise, they wouldn't make that claim.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.140]   No, I think what they're saying is more subtle. I think they're
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.040]   saying usr LPS should have held them. We are on the board of
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.100]   these companies from day one, we have better insights in the
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.820]   second decade than in the first production board founder David
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.360]   Friedberg, how do you think about early exits, distributing
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.720]   capital, because you do have also with a startup stock, you're
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.000]   going to have a startup studio structure, which you should
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.700]   explain to the audience how a startup studio works, because you
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.120]   create companies, which is, you know, was a terrible place to be
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.400]   maybe five or 10 years ago, but it turns out you're in the best
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.740]   place because zero to one is where all the values created
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.640]   explain the two things, what a startup studio is for people who
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.540]   don't know. And then what's your view of selling early? If a
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.120]   company of yours goes public,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.840]   I think there's a big, there's a bigger kind of framing here,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.100]   which is a lot of
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.020]   There's, you know, professional money managers have tried to find
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.360]   ways to create what is called permanent capital, which is a
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.740]   vehicle whereby they can continuously make investments
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.120]   decide when to sell those investments and recycle the
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.240]   capital into new investments. With the idea being that over
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.300]   time, they're not at risk of capital outflows, meaning
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:16.180]   investors pull their money out, and they're not at risk of, you
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.400]   know, needing to kind of go out and raise more money and they
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.980]   can, they can share in the value creation as they grow their book
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.040]   value over time.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.440]   Years ago, a bunch of hedge funds set up public reinsurance
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.360]   companies. Dan Loeb did this. What's his name? I know, did
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.820]   this lackman did it and basically, Bill Ackman did it,
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.680]   what they did is they set up a public company and you public
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.740]   company, a reinsurer. And then they use that that reinsure to
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.060]   underwrite reinsurance. And when you underwrite reinsurance, you
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.580]   get all this capital that you can then go invest, and then the
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.880]   hedge fund manage that investment. And because it's
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.400]   actually a public company, it's a got a balance sheet, the
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.640]   shareholders can't pull their money out, right, it's just got
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.460]   a balance sheet. And the hedge fund was managing that balance
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.160]   sheet. And you know, generating good returns. And this is
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.320]   effectively what Warren Buffett does. And everyone looks to
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.120]   Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett, it's kind of the, you
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.100]   know, the key kind of long term here, which is, hey, look, if
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.000]   you can keep investing and keep compounding value, this thing
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.380]   can grow, you know, exponentially over time. So you
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.660]   know, the way we set up the production board, I had the
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.240]   option of raising a fund and being a fund manager, I chose
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.160]   to set up the production board, because I was much more
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.500]   interested in I think, the similar sort of vein of what
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.360]   Sequoia is saying, which is like, how do you become a longer
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.020]   term, builder and a longer term holder, and where you don't have
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   these incentives to return capital, because you only get
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.520]   paid if and when you return capital. And, you know, and then
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.560]   you're kind of making these decisions to, you know, because
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.480]   your shareholders are saying, well, you had a good return
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.180]   quickly, give me the shares back and let me and mark your profit
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.360]   and take your share. And I was also more interested in look,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.120]   the fact is, over time, there's always going to be opportunities
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.060]   to chase with the capital. So if we have a great gain, if
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.900]   something works out really well, we can take the gain, and we can
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.180]   reinvest that capital and building new things, there's no
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.700]   shortage of opportunities to pursue for the rest of my life.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.760]   So that's why I set up the production board initially in
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.980]   partnership with alphabet. And then later on, we brought in,
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.400]   you know, Bill Gates and other Allen and co and other kind of
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.100]   investors that have a similar sort of mindset, which is like,
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.520]   let's just, if we haven't an exit, recycle that capital and
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.220]   continuously, they're not looking for a quick win, they
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:21.520]   don't have
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.000]   pension payments
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.720]   to make, right, they don't have a reason to distribute cash. And
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.120]   so same with me, like, I don't have a reason to take cash out.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.060]   So the objective was just build this thing over time and grow
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.420]   value over time. And that's why I set it up the way I did. And I
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.300]   think it allows us to make, you know, really long term bets that
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.020]   are super risky. Most of what we're doing is super technical
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.860]   and difficult and maybe very hard to pull off, many of which
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.780]   are still after many years in a very early
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.560]   very patient capital, patient capital, and also the you know,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.640]   the preference for
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.060]   not trying to find exits. But I have found this, I'll tell you
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.180]   one thing, I've been through a number of circumstances where I
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.520]   have seen businesses I've been an investor in or involved in,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.660]   that have traded long term value for short term opportunity,
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.780]   meaning there's an opportunity to make a business that you can
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.780]   then go raise capital against, you change your strategy to do
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.420]   that, then you go raise VC funding. And now the business
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.320]   looks like it's working. But the 10x or 100x opportunity was
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.840]   taken off the table, because you ended up going down this
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.760]   different path, that was a sure thing.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.980]   And then you went down this other path, that was more likely
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.860]   to work, that created value in the short term that allowed you
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.320]   to mark up your investment or raise capital against that. But
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.180]   you gave up the big long term thing. And I think that's
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.940]   something I've been trying to avoid with the structure. And it
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.040]   certainly makes sense with some of these other folks and what
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.820]   they're trying to do.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.900]   So what we're getting at here, Sachs is decision making by
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.400]   capital allocators, and on behalf of their LPS, or letting
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.640]   the LPS make those decisions. Inevitably, the crypto world
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.040]   says, Well, why aren't you just doing this in a DAO?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.660]   And, you know, having some decentralized authority, make the
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.560]   decisions. I had Vinnie Ling, I've had a conversation with our
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   friend Vinnie Lingham, after the Solana stuff and multi coin
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   capital. And we were talking about DAOs for early stage
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.180]   investing or syndicates and just brainstorming, hey, is there a
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.740]   way to do this? And the problem I came to every time was, should
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.200]   a bunch of folks be making decisions who are not meeting
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.920]   with the companies or meeting with 2000 companies a year,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:27.040]   what are your thoughts on a DAO? Representing sort of what we
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.680]   collectively do, but we all do it, obviously, in different
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.340]   flavors?
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.680]   Does this actually exist? Yeah.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.520]   Well, there have been DAOs that have existed to vote on buying
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.920]   NFTs. So yes, for collectibles.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.120]   I mean, I kind of feel like I'll let you know when it actually
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.680]   gets here.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.200]   So open minded to it, but who knows?
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.240]   Yeah, but I mean, we talked about these things as if they
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.480]   already are here, and they're not quite here. I mean,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.800]   technically, I know they exist, but people haven't really
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:56.040]   figured out how to use them to, you know, to be a fund manager,
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   for example,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.580]   I think David's right. I think the look, I there, there are
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:05.100]   these three immutable features of web 3.0, that we're going to
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.580]   have to figure out over the next few years. So the obvious ones
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.980]   are decentralization, right? That makes sense. The second
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.300]   obvious one phase, the level of composability, which means that
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.880]   your plug and play with everything. But the third one is
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.560]   this idea of democratization.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.320]   And governance, right? And that's where DAOs come in. And
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.860]   David's right, we don't really know what the boundaries of that
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:33.800]   feature is. I think it exists in some small level scale. But we
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   need to have many iterations of companies get built to figure out
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   what it'll mean. So I don't know, I'm taking a pretty
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.860]   traditional approach, Jason, which is that, you know, it's
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.380]   kind of like a crawl, walk, run strategy. Right now, I'm in the
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.560]   crawling phase. And I'm kind of saying, how did, how did the
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.240]   web 1.0 and web 2.0 develop, and I'm trying just copying it. So
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.740]   you know, in web 1.0 and 2.0, you needed companies like Sun
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.460]   Microsystems, and Cisco, and, you know, all of the plumbers
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.300]   foundational stuff to build plumbing for the internet, to
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.120]   allow the thousand flowers to bloom at the application level.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.840]   And, you know, we had a very good reference model, by the way,
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.240]   for web 1.0. For most people, if you want to look at it, it's
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.060]   called the OSI reference stack. And if you actually look at that
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.900]   OSI stack,
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.180]   you can translate that to all kinds of value creation over the
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.640]   first, you know, two arcs of the internet over 20 years, trillions
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.360]   of dollars was created by just following each of those
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.880]   substrates. And in those transitional layers was where
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   these great, beautiful companies were built. And I think
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.760]   similarly, we're going to do that again, but we need a
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.300]   different stack to represent what Web3 is. So yeah, you know,
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.540]   this week, we did something which was pretty straightforward,
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.060]   which was this idea that if you're going to build all these
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.320]   apps, you're going to need a lot of data. And you're going to
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.500]   need a distributed compute infrastructure, which means
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.960]   you're going to need very simple building blocks like remote
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.580]   procedure calls RPC that exists in web 2.0. It's kind of a not
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.120]   something you don't really think about, but in Web three doesn't
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.340]   exist. And so it's all this AWS, you know, GCP, like
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.300]   infrastructure that has to get built. And that's what syndica
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.420]   does. And I think that's a really very interesting
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.020]   observation there, because everybody is trying to go to the
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.200]   application level and talk about the consumer experience.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.700]   But before you even have the ability, you know, we're talking
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.660]   about cars before we've even made a transmission or, you
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.160]   know, that's exactly right. This is why crypto comes across as so
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.820]   delusional and strange. Sometimes they wrote 3000 ICO
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.940]   papers, none of them were about infrastructure, they're all
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.660]   about some sort of endgame.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.180]   The thing is, it's a very delicate balancing act, right?
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.420]   You need a handful of companies that capture consumer
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.580]   imagination, right, that then incentivize all of the plumbing
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.080]   companies to come in and build underneath it, right? So it's a
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.700]   very, it's a very delicate balancing act, right? So you
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.020]   needed CompuServe in order to enable a bunch of companies,
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.660]   then you needed AOL in order to enable another set, then you
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.380]   needed Yahoo, then you needed Google. And in all of that, what
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.560]   happened was people were pulled through, right, you needed
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.180]   Amazon commerce to justify AWS. So we're in that world where
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.540]   it's going to be a little back and forth where the pendulum will
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.300]   swing back and forth between consumer experiences that capture
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.960]   imagination get to some level of scale, that then create incentive
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.200]   for the developer ecosystem and the technology infrastructure to
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.720]   catch up.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.940]   Zillow, which we talked about previously, became an iBuyer.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.880]   What's an iBuyer? That means you buy a bunch of single family
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.060]   homes in all likelihood, like Opendoor and Redfin have been
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.880]   doing, and then you hope to flip them, maybe improve them and
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.360]   maybe lower costs to the consumers by taking out real
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.500]   estate brokers. This has created a lot of bad feelings amongst
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.440]   real estate brokers, a TikTok video,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.120]   and a bunch of other things. I've been on a lot of social media
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.620]   forums, and I've been on a lot of social media forums, and I've
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.420]   been on a lot of social media forums, and I've been on a lot of
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.680]   social media forums, and I've been on a lot of social media
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.720]   forums, and I've been on a lot of social media forums, and I've
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.840]   been on a lot of social media forums, and I've been on a lot of
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.940]   social media forums, and I've been on a lot of social media
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.680]   forums, and I've been on a lot of social media forums, and I've
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.220]   been on a lot of social media forums, and I've been on a lot of
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:05.600]   social media forums, and I've been on a lot of social media
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.400]   forums, and I've been on a lot of social media forums, and I've
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:06.860]   been on a lot of social media forums, and I've been on a lot of
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.400]   over the decades. According ahead of their earnings call
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.960]   this week, Bloomberg reported Zillow is trying to offload
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.900]   7,000 7,000 homes for 2.8 billion. That's about a 400k
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.300]   average per home. And Zillow shares dropped 37% this week
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:28.060]   alone from 100 to 66, their market cap has dropped 9 billion
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.760]   throughout the week. And they're down 70% from a peak valuation
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.860]   of 48 billion just in February about six months ago. Zillow is
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.020]   going to reduce its workforce by 25% over the next few months.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.980]   I'm assuming that's all those I buyers. Anecdotally, a lot of
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.720]   what I'm hearing is they bought homes indiscriminately. The
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.040]   anecdotal stories that are breaking on Twitter and other
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.180]   forums with real estate brokers are, they would look at a home,
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.620]   they didn't know that it had a noisy neighbor or it was near
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.820]   power lines or whatever the people who came in bought them
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.740]   indiscriminately, maybe too fast, whereas some other
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.620]   companies maybe Opendoor or Redfin were more considered I
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.740]   actually had Glenn from Redfin on the pod.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.140]   And he said, he's a very hard not long ago. And he said, it's a
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.780]   very hard operational business, you have to be very careful on
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.480]   what you buy and your entry price that seems to have turned
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.460]   out to be true. What do you think, Friedberg,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:20.140]   Rich Barton, who runs Zillow is considered a legend in Silicon
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.000]   Valley, you know, he has been involved in some of the most
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.020]   successful internet companies. And you know, when he stepped
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.600]   back in as the founder of Zillow, step back in to run the
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.900]   business a few years ago, it was viewed as kind of a second,
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.780]   you know, resurrection of this business, and he was going to
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.000]   take it into new areas. And then three and a half years ago, he
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.960]   announced the side buyer program, which everyone thought
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.400]   was such a, you know, incredibly strong move, and obviously
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.160]   chased Opendoor, which Chamath is involved in, and I'm sure
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.520]   we'll share more on. But it was such an obvious opportunity that
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.860]   if you could add liquidity to the real estate market, the
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.220]   residential real estate market, there's an incredible amount of
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:01.000]   value to be had. Now, the way that they wrote about it, when
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.800]   they talked about it initially, and then the way that they've
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.840]   kind of talked about in their earnings report this week was
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.880]   that they were trying to be a quote market maker in the
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.600]   business. And it turned out that what they were really doing was
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.160]   being more of a speculator, right, a market maker looks at
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.260]   bids and asks and the spread and then tries to create a gap in
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.900]   that spread and make and take some share of it. And by adding
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.560]   that liquidity, the idea is the spreads can narrow and they can
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.820]   make money. In this case, they were looking at the historical
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.680]   velocity of selling prices of homes, and using that as a way
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.820]   to kind of project what was going to happen, which is
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.060]   basically a market maker, which makes them much more of a
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.900]   speculator than a market maker. And they clearly got this wrong.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.540]   And they're kind of quote unquote, models on, you know,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.660]   where prices headed ended up getting them in trouble. There's
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.900]   also the inherent conflict where they are now competing in a way
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.360]   with the brokers that generate a lot of revenue for them and are a
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.440]   big part of their core business. And they were clearly, you know,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.020]   cannibalizing their own business where the Zestimate and some of
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.360]   the other scoring that they provide as a data and analytics
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.580]   platform to both sides of the existing market,
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.380]   they're blown up because they're coming in and saying,
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.720]   we're going to put our, you know, our foot down and say, this
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.080]   is what the value is. And it inevitably kind of cannibalizes
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.720]   the core product that they provide to both sides of the
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.660]   market. So you know, one could argue this was flawed from the
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.600]   beginning, the execution clearly was way off. And it begs the
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.840]   question, you know, where was leadership and kind of tracking
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   what was going on here as these guys were buying homes at market
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.540]   prices that are well above what they were actually selling for in
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.120]   the market, no one was actually doing on the ground work. They
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.160]   were all doing kind of speculative models and saying,
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.560]   this is what we think.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.660]   Will happen. And then they woke up way too late and lost way too
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.880]   much money. I think they lost $300 million in the quarter. So,
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.360]   you know, really a lot of questions and a lot of
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   challenges on this. I'm sure Chamath has a point of view on,
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.240]   you know, what makes Opendoor distinct from from Zillow. But
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.500]   there's a really important kind of, you know, underlying here,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:00.280]   you know, the maturity of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.360]   who's crushed it so many times, doesn't mean that they're
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.400]   perfect. And, you know,
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.360]   this is a big mess.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.640]   You can go really too fast into a turn here. And clearly they
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.480]   flipped the car. Chamath, I don't know how comfortable you
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.380]   are talking about this.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.060]   Very comfortable. Okay, well, then here we go. Number one, you
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.680]   know, I'm not on the board of Opendoor. Of Opendoor.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.300]   Maybe tell us about your history with Opendoor Chamath would be
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.600]   super.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.160]   Look, I look, I am one of the largest individual shareholders
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.480]   of that company, I think somewhere between three and 4%
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.980]   of the business I own. We, you know, I came to own those shares
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.380]   with a large shareholder. I'm not a shareholder. I'm not a
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.700]   large investment, as well as through the transaction, where we
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:48.240]   merged one of our SPACs into it and took it. Yes. Couple things
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.780]   to say. The first is about the CEO and founder of Opendoor.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:57.900]   Eric Wu is special, special, special. So let me just leave it
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:02.580]   at that. On that topic. The second is, I think that Rich
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.960]   Barton is very special.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.860]   I think that he's very, very important. I think that he's a
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.880]   very important person. And I think that he's a very important
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.860]   person. And I think that he's a very important person. And I'm
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.920]   very, very happy to be part of it. But it speaks to two big
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.360]   mistakes that Zillow made. The first is that catching a wave of
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.560]   disruption is very difficult when you have an old line
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.840]   business that is fundamentally competitive with the new line of
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.680]   business. And Zillow, as David said, had this thing called Zestimate,
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.180]   which is a very interesting thing. And it's a very interesting
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.120]   thing to think about. And it's a very interesting thing to think
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.160]   about. And it's a very interesting thing to think about.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.920]   And it's a very interesting thing to think about. And it's a very
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.440]   interesting thing to think about. And it's a very interesting thing
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.600]   to think about. And it's a very interesting thing to think about.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.820]   And it's a very interesting thing to think about. And it's a very
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.260]   interesting thing to think about. And it's a very interesting thing
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.220]   to think about. And it's a very interesting thing to think about.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.120]   And it's a very interesting thing to think about. And it's a very
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.900]   interesting thing to think about. And it's a very interesting thing
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.320]   to think about. And it's a very interesting thing to think about.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.120]   And it's a very interesting thing to think about. And it's a very
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.560]   click worthy, then if you go in there, and it shows some depressed value, you think the site
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.960]   sucks. That's the unfortunate psychological reaction. So I think whether we believe it or
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:10.020]   not, or whether Zillow knew it or not, is estimate over time, basically calcified this idea of price
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.920]   inflation. So the accuracy was never a goal. So then if you take that business, and then you try
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.840]   to orient it towards home buying, and you use probably zestimate or some version of it to
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:25.640]   underpin how you buy and take risk, it creates a lot of risk. And I think this is essentially what
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.440]   played out where they were over buying homes. And they didn't know how to price this stuff
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.960]   accurately. So you know, my partner Ravi tweeted this out, but you know, the open door margin on
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:42.180]   average is about 10%. The Zillow margin on average was 3%. So they had a much more razor thin margin
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:47.800]   of safety here, which again speaks to pricing. And then it speaks to this third thing, which is that
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:55.940]   if you start doing one thing and do it really well with software, the gains over years really
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:01.260]   compound. And so when somebody else shows up and tries to pivot their business to try to copy it,
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.480]   it's very, very difficult. The classic example is Google versus Yahoo, Yahoo had a beautiful
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.860]   directory driven business. But when Larry and Sergey really Larry invented PageRank,
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:17.500]   and then invented that first version of a Google search index. As we saw it play out over the next
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.500]   10 or 15 years,
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.160]   it was impossible for Yahoo to really invest the technical law to the technical capital necessary
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:29.700]   to catch up with Google. And every day and every week and every year as free work talked about last
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:35.760]   week, those technical gains compound and compound and now Google is completely unassailable with
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:43.420]   respect to search. I suspect we will look back and the ability to accurately forecast price and
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:48.200]   volatility and the ability to sell these assets.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:53.220]   at a defined margin of safety in a predictable way is something
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:58.900]   software can solve. And it seems that open door is the first
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.920]   doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the only one. But it has an
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.460]   enormous headstart now. And as long as they can keep iterating,
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.460]   those gains will compound. So that's what I think. I just
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.820]   think this is a wonderful business. run by an incredible
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:19.100]   CEO to wrap up this Zillow story sacks. Any thoughts on, you
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.060]   know, to my point here, you know, you're the rating agency,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.040]   and you had this business and the business might be
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.940]   orthogonal to the existing money printing machine on a strategic
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.900]   basis. What do you think? Any lessons or mistakes here? In
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.480]   terms of when you handicap Zillow? Or do you want to just
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.320]   move on and talk about it?
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.680]   I mean, look, I'm a I was a C investor and open door because
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.260]   rabbi invite me to the seed round. So, you know, I'm a
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:43.820]   little biased.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.940]   Here, but I think it's pretty obvious what happened. Zillow
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.080]   tried to copy them, the business is much more operationally
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.420]   complicated than they realized it's a low business, low margin
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.240]   business with the tuck, which requires a ton of capital. So if
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.820]   you're off a little bit, the losses can be huge. And Zillow
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.160]   couldn't figure it out. They underestimate the difficulty.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.140]   That's what frequently happens when a big company tries to copy
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.420]   a smaller sort of upstart company. So I mean, that to me
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.420]   is what happened in a nutshell. Quite frankly, we're an hour
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.820]   into this pod, and we haven't discussed
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.200]   issues, any issue that I think is broadly relevant to most
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.700]   Americans. I think this is one of our worst episodes, we're
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.060]   going to bore everyone to tears. I frankly don't understand what
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.800]   the you're doing. I don't even know why we have a topic
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.140]   list. When you start pulling it out of your ass like DAOs. And I
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.260]   don't know what the else.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.460]   All right. All right. Fine. We'll talk about politics.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.820]   I thought the doubt question sucked. All right. I'm just
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.200]   giving you the opportunity.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.260]   That we shouldn't even be talking about cut it out of the
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.320]   show. Cut it out.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.320]   This whole episode should be cut.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.400]   Jesus Christ.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.380]   This is episodes you ever done.
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.180]   Yeah, I agree. I think we should cut all that.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:46.900]   It's going great.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.620]   Jason, I agree that that part where we cut it. That's all
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.680]   right, fine. You got some loser.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.740]   I'm trying to give you guys the benefit of the doubt to just
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.600]   because it was like, no one cares. All right, fine. Calm
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.380]   down, everybody. You want to talk about politics? We talk
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.460]   about politics. Okay, Sax. Go ahead. Tell us about the
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:04.960]   election.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.720]   Okay, I'll just rattle off some of the key results here from
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.100]   blue states. We have a woke lash going on all across the
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.620]   country.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.460]   The important thing in Virginia, a state that Biden won by 10.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.760]   He's cranky, huge upset Republican Glenn Young can be
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.120]   Terry McAuliffe, former governor there. He was this was a huge
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.420]   upset McAuliffe was supposed to win. Youngkin 151 48. So that's
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:35.540]   a 13 point swing versus where Biden was just a year ago. In
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.840]   New Jersey, a state that Biden won by 16 points, the Democrat
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.580]   held on to it, but only by 1.5 points. And I bet you anything,
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.020]   the RNC is kicking itself that didn't give any money to
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.940]   chatarelli, who's the challenger, who I think almost
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:52.380]   who came very, very close. And there were down ticket seats
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:58.740]   that went Republican so that the this is really interesting in
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.040]   South Jersey, which is a blue collar bastion for Democrats.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.760]   We need versus burr. That's right. The Democratic State
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.240]   Senate leader Steve Sweeney lost to a truck driver named Ed Durr
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.020]   who spent a grand total of 153 years in the Democratic Party.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:17.500]   153 dollars on his campaign okay so those were some and then we have some other write-in like
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.880]   he was printing on the lawyers to say write me in I think I don't think is a writing but but any
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.580]   event so so implications for 2022 Dave Wasserman of cook political report calculates somewhere
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:33.760]   between a 44 and 51 c game from the gop they only need five C's to win the majority so it's looking
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:39.820]   very bleak for the Democrats in 2022 and then I think you also had some very interesting local
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:46.120]   elections in Minneapolis voters rejected a proposal to defund the police with 56 of the vote
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.880]   uh they there was a ballot proposition to change the police department into some sort
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:58.240]   of larger public safety group voters were having none of it in Seattle which is a very
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.460]   liberal city they voted for a literal Republican as city attorney which is the office that
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:09.760]   prosecutes misdemeanors so against a police abolitionist who said she would stop prosecutor
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:15.100]   shooting misdemeanors you're forgetting that in Virginia it wasn't just Glenn Youngkin that won but
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:20.920]   basically it was Terry McAuliffe and then a lieutenant governor who is some milk toast
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:27.580]   individual and an attorney general candidate who was caught in blackface which by the way there is
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:35.020]   no more racist thing you can do just to let you guys let everybody all the non-colors okay guys
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.340]   please don't do blackface or brown face it's such a bad it's just not it's not you're right it was a
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.320]   huge so so the lieutenant and Youngkin and it was a it was a black female Lieutenant Governor and a
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.760]   Latino attorney general that's right and they swept right that's right that's right so the
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:54.160]   Lieutenant Governor was Winston Sears uh she's a a black woman Republican if you've seen the photo
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.620]   of her she's frequently photographed with a giant assault rifle in her hands uh that's her and then
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:05.740]   uh a Hispanic attorney general Jason meari's uh one as well so yeah it was a huge sweep
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.280]   and then you know in Long Island and Staten Island which again are
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:16.060]   blue counties you had two Republican prosecutors beat the local sort of uh incumbent Democrat
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:25.660]   decarcerations DA's red just I think I think this is very clear which is um Trump was behaviorally
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:32.140]   extreme and after four years people were sick of it nobody wanted that behavioral extremism because
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.940]   it was unpredictable and people felt frankly in danger and I think that that was legitimate he
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.220]   also turned out to be extremely lazy
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:45.520]   and probably pretty dumb now what we're realizing is the different form of extremism which is policy
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.320]   extremism will also be met with the same response which is that you you can't sustain election
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.960]   results and wins right so people care consistently about three things they care about the economy
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.280]   they care about the education of their children and they care about safety
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:09.160]   and the thing that Glenn Youngkin did which I thought was at least a playbook for centrists
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.780]   and the right and it's also a playbook for the Democrats if they choose to embrace it is to
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:19.060]   understand that these things are reaching a tipping point where you know again we've said this before
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:24.880]   it is possible to live in a state of mind where you believe in Black Lives Matter and you believe
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:31.120]   in law and order right and and when you try to pit those two things against each other for example
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.400]   like you would have thought the one place where they would have basically defunded the police in
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.100]   its entirety would have been Minneapolis after George Floyd but it's not going to happen it's not
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:45.340]   going to happen but instead even they drew the line and said no or New York or New York there was a
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:49.420]   there was a really compelling quote actually by this woman I think it was in the New York Times
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:57.460]   um and what she said was I didn't elect Joe Biden to be FDR I elected him to tack to the middle and
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:02.920]   just calm things down so that everybody could exhale so that we could reset same with me and
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.840]   what's that that was Abigail spamburger actually she's a Virginia Democrat yeah she's a Virginia
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.040]   Democrat who won
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.380]   a seat in one of those blue counties that just flipped red to vote for Youngkin and since she
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:19.120]   got elected I guess she got elected last year she's been telling the Democratic she's the one
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.040]   who called out Pelosi in that you know caucus meeting saying I don't ever want to hear the
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.720]   words defund the police again that is electoral poison and then she said yes nobody elected Biden
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:34.300]   to be FDR they elected to be normal and stop the chaos and so yeah certainly my vote yeah
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.980]   yeah there's a big backlash going on because Biden has decided to start governing like Bernie Sanders
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:46.240]   so do that so sacks is the lesson Dems learned this time around is it's very easy to beat
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:52.480]   Trump but it's very hard to beat a moderate Republican no no it's not that it's like you
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.760]   just have to be a rational normal person that's what I mean by a moderate Republican well you
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.600]   just have to be moderate I don't think it matters but this is but this is the key but that's the
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:08.140]   Dems it was so easy for them to use Trump you know but these three topics are not a Republican tent
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:14.080]   poll nor are they a Democratic temple they are the tent pole of reasonable people yes meaning which
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.460]   most people are reasonable hey guys get out of the way so that we can you know have a reasonable life
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.500]   in an economy hey folks please make sure my kids when I send them to school for eight hours a day
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:28.120]   come back reasonably educated and please keep my streets safe and I'm not really willing to
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:33.520]   decarcerate ad hoc to such a degree that all of a sudden crime gets out of control those
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.080]   are not Democratic or Republican tent poles those are just moderate centrist rational things to do
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.060]   things to believe in yeah being and also behave normally like I I think whatever happened with
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:47.740]   these progressives where they couldn't pass you know the stimulus bills and things that almost
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:54.040]   everybody agreed on Glenn Youngkin was not behaviorally extremist yes and and from a policy
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:53:01.300]   perspective was pretty much down the middle Eric Adams Eric Adams is not behaviorally extreme and
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:06.820]   he is politically down the middle the mayor of Buffalo who got re-elected is not behaviorally
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.020]   extreme and he's been elected to the Republican Party and he's been elected to the Republican Party
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:12.760]   he's politically down the middle do you start to see a pattern here yeah nobody wants AOC Bernie
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:18.160]   Elizabeth Warren or Trump I think it's not it's not a question of AOC or Bernie or Trump it's just
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:25.600]   that right now the temperature of America is let's just all exhale and just recenter ourselves as a
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:31.720]   country yeah and so moderation and centrism is actually what calls for today I don't know how to
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:37.480]   predict what happens in 15 or 20 years and maybe AOC is the canary in the coal mine for where the
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:43.420]   world goes by a plurality of people in 15 or 20 years but what's clear is it's not where it goes
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:49.060]   today and I think that we it all behooves us to just take a real step back and exhale and just
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:54.760]   read the tea leaves because every single thing that the Democrats tried to do to sort of like
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:00.100]   make this extreme really didn't work the race baiting all of that stuff really kind of failed
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:06.100]   and I think that that's important to listen to you know because you had a lot of black Indian Chinese
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.900]   families that just showed up Hispanic
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:15.460]   you know that again reliable Democratic voters and voted for Glenn Youngkin in a way that was
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:23.260]   surprising to me right and then so if you compare New Jersey and and Virginia Biden won Virginia by 10
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:32.380]   he the the Democratic nominee lost Biden won New Jersey by 16 and Phil Murphy barely
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:37.840]   squeaked by it was like 10 000 votes Jersey's always had a a Republican kind of
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:43.000]   leaning group uh they're very uh too Biden won by 16. this should have been a cakewalk yeah but I
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.400]   think that's 16. how much of that is get Trump out of office is what we I think the Democrats need to
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:54.160]   parse and I blew it by going to radical we're repudiating behavioral extremism and policy
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:59.140]   extremism so I think we just need to realize rational normal chill people
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:04.060]   who can do reasonable things get our kids educated so for example on the education front
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.780]   um I don't know if you guys saw this because I tweeted and you can put this Nick in the
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:14.140]   group chat but in California right now there's a battle over math class ridiculous right where the
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.440]   title I'm just going to read the title because it sets it off California tries to close the
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.600]   gap in math but sets off a backlash proposed guidelines in the state would de-emphasize
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.240]   calculus reject the idea that some children are naturally gifted and build a connection
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:34.180]   to social justice critics say math shouldn't be political well of course the way that those
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.720]   articles are always written it's always about the backlash you know they don't talk about
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:42.820]   what what the people in charge are trying to do to basically degrade the curriculum of course there's
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:47.080]   a backlash because parents don't like put the people on these school boards are doing this
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:53.020]   was the sleeper issue in Virginia was the school board issue you had um you know parents were
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:57.340]   already angry that the teachers unions had kept the schools closed for a year and a half during
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:03.460]   covet and while their kids were at home you know work doing classes over Zoom parents got a good
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.660]   look at what some of their kids were learning and didn't like what they saw I mean we're talking about lessons
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:14.500]   plans that incorporated CRT and you know the 1619 Project view of America singling out kids by their
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:19.960]   race making them focus on difference and then there were some you know rather explicit materials
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:25.660]   at young grade levels about you know LGBT issues and so this led to a whole bunch of confrontations
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:31.720]   at school board meetings where parents of all races objected to you know the least lesson plans
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.160]   for their kids and the school boards and administrators just dismissed their complaints out
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.600]   of hand and you know their
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.400]   message was well we're not teaching CRT to your kids uh but if we were it's a good thing and only
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:48.340]   white supremacists would object so you know that was sort of what was happening in the background
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:53.860]   and then McAuliffe comes along and makes this gigantic Gaff in the last debates about two weeks
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.640]   before the election where he says I don't think parents should be telling the schools what to
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:04.120]   teach and what yes this is with the customer no he said that he said that on a debate and he said
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.540]   that in a debate about two weeks for the election McAuliffe was leading through this whole thing
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:12.400]   until that debate where and this was sort of a Kinsley Gaff in the sense that you know Michael
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:18.700]   Kinsley said a Gaff is when a candidate inadvertently uh says something true you know this is McCullough's
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.480]   view is that the teachers Union should be controlling the schools not the parents well
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:30.340]   um yes so this is what yonkin uh jumped all over all of his ads in the last weeks of campaign really
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:37.480]   focused on this issue you know poured gasoline on a fire and then the most tone-deaf thing McCullough did is he had Randy
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.520]   Weingarten who is the head of the uh the big teachers Union come in and campaign for him at
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.840]   the 11th hour well of course that's not going to save him because people are sick and tired of the
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:54.340]   teachers unions so you know this was basically the big sleeper issue CRT and the schools in Virginia
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:58:01.660]   and you know this is this I think specifically is what the Democratic Party has to wake up to is
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.880]   that these progressive ideologies are not popular the other thing I'll say about Glenn yonkin is that
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.420]   this is another
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.020]   thing that the that the Republicans should hopefully pay attention to which is
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:19.360]   you can look normal act normal be normal you know this is not an extremist in any way this
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:25.120]   guy was the co-CEO of Carlisle which is a huge and very successful private equity firm so this
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:31.900]   is a very rational reasonable person who um you know didn't embrace anything that was really that
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:37.360]   pro-Trump and that should be a real wake-up call to the Republicans which is hey let's
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:43.180]   just run a fleet of normal people I think what you saw I think Chamath is right that what you saw in
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:48.340]   Virginia is that the playbook that Gavin Newsom just used to defeat the recall in California did
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:57.520]   not work in Virginia which is he tried to paint yonkin as a Trump proxy and youngkin very definitely
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:02.560]   you know avoided that he got Trump's yes he got Trump's endorsement but very early in the process
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:08.140]   he did not have Trump come to the state um and you'd have to say it also helped yonkin a lot
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:12.880]   that social media that Trump wasn't all over social media because he's been banned so you
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.620]   know in a weird way Facebook and Twitter deserve an assist here um because they helped keep Trump
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:23.860]   out of the Virginia race so you know this playbook that that Newsom defined that worked
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.660]   very effectively from California which is simply to keep running against Trump I think Democrats
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.500]   thought they'd be able to win elections for years based on that that playbook didn't even last two
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:39.520]   months so you know so I think Democrats are gonna have to find a new playbook here okay so Friedberg
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:46.600]   uh on this California issue around education one of the key or most controversial um concepts is
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:51.460]   detracking in other words instead of having high performing students go to a high performing track
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:56.920]   and then everybody else stay behind maybe keeps in not all cases but keep some of the students
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:02.440]   together because there is some research that shows if done right if you track people together
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:09.160]   the higher performing students will pull up the ones who are slightly behind other people say we're
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:15.400]   basically uh throttling people who could be the next Einstein or the next world-class leader in
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:21.520]   science math Etc uh any thoughts on the concept of detracking since I'm assuming you were in the
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:30.280]   high speed track in science and math maybe we should get rid of like JV and varsity sports teams
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:37.360]   to play baseball and Major League Baseball as well and you know any distinction of performance
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:46.240]   um or exceptionalism goes away you know and and that is kind of the the key social question is are
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:53.440]   we going to give up exceptionalism um to minimize uh the distance uh between the exceptional and the
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.280]   average and that seems to be what's happening makes people makes people feel bad but I've said
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.020]   this point before you know we're doing it when we try and think about you know the billionaire tax or
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:10.900]   you as soon as you start to limit progress um you reduce inequality but you limit progress and the
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:17.920]   same will be true not just in science not just in business but also in sports and athletics and and
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.900]   any other kind of system where you will have exceptionalism you will have an average you will
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:29.860]   have a distribution amongst human performance and as soon as we try and limit the difference in that
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:36.400]   distribution um we move the entire curve to the left here's the counter free bird
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:43.120]   um what some studies have shown is yes you will uh throttle the high performers but we're seeing
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.300]   along race lines certain demographics being left behind other ones excelling and that you can get
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.920]   yeah it's an ethics and values question right like do you think that individual freedom and
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.800]   the opportunity to pursue your opportunity your your exceptionalism um should be taken
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:06.340]   away from you such that others who aren't as exceptional as you are given um you know greater
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.200]   progress than they would have had on their own um and that's the key Crux of what all of these
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.980]   social systems are grappling with whether it's in sports or business or finance or or um or education
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:23.440]   is what's the right thing to do and that ethics question is going to be defined by the social
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.640]   agenda of the moment and you know the means of the moment and what we all think is is the right thing
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.960]   to do and it's different all over the world and it's different within political systems but it's
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.420]   a very divisive point that I think folks who find themselves on one end of that exceptional spectrum
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.320]   in different aspects are going to have one point of view and folks on the other end of that
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.920]   exceptional spectrum are going to have other points of view and everyone's going to be sensitively
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.320]   tuned to where they fall in that spectrum I will say one thing though on that spectrum exceptionalism
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:56.140]   is rarer than the average therefore it is likely the case that over the next years and decades we
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.580]   will see the um
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.900]   the idea that we should remove exceptionalism in business and exceptionalism in education
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:08.980]   exceptionalism in sports because it benefits the majority and um and and no one kind of
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:14.200]   recognizes and a lot of folks don't recognize the progress that is made by exceptionalism and
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.340]   um and that's and then we're going to wake up one day and be like oh wait a second we don't
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:22.420]   have the the best sports teams winning all the gold medals we don't have the smartest kids we
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:27.280]   don't have the best businesses China and Europe and Brazil and whomever else the emerging markets
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.560]   in India are going to start to have such a good point I think this is a very old debate it's the
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.300]   debate between a quality of opportunity and a quality of results yeah and the progressive
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:43.000]   left is absolutely obsessed with a quality of results or outcomes which they now call equity
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.380]   which is we're going to take people at the finish line and we're going to move them around we're
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:52.360]   going to redistribute the outcomes to achieve a more proportional representation or something
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.460]   more fair as opposed to giving everybody as much opportunity
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:02.560]   at the outset as possible that is the fixation right now that is why they're taking out advanced
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.300]   math in the schools they're trying to level people it's not going to work it doesn't lead to a more
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.440]   we want to have an exceptional Society where I think we should be focusing is creating as much
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.660]   opportunity for everybody the way to do that would be to let every child go to the school of their
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:22.840]   choosing so that we would stop trapping kids in bad schools but back to kind of bring this back
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.400]   to the election for a second because I think it was a very clear repudiation of this progressive mindset
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.740]   and I think there's essentially two sets of reactions to it if you look at sort of all the
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:41.560]   left-wing commentators the the one who I thought seemed to get it the most was CNN's Van Jones
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.780]   actually had I thought you know a rare moment of introspection where he said it was this was
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.940]   the the results were a five alarm fire he said it was a big big wake-up call for the Democrats
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:57.340]   to stop annoying voters with woke hectoring um he he actually advised Biden to start triangulating
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:02.320]   against the woke left in the way that Bill Clinton did I mean which is something that I've been
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.820]   suggesting on this this pod so you're saying something super important the game Theory now
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:13.240]   is for Biden to put to the test the progressive left because now he can go firmly to the center
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:21.400]   and he can put all of the pressure on the progressive left in the house and uh Warren and
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.440]   Bernie Sanders in the Senate well he's right that's the first thing he should do is he should
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.740]   he should pull a sister soldier on Bernie Sanders he he can't keep delegating the domestic agenda
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.880]   to Bernie Sanders he if he wants to save his presidency he'll start triangulating in the way
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.100]   that Bill Clinton did I'm not sure he's going to I think there's already a misperception that
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.380]   the reason why they lost selection is because they didn't deliver the goodies in this house
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:52.540]   reconciliation bill um that in other words I don't think the public cares about the goodies I mean
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.740]   they care about this normalcy and centrism yeah there's a part of the network right base that does
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:02.440]   the what's in that house reconciliation bill but but here's the thing Democratic turnout in this
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:08.620]   election was extremely high the Democratic turnout for McAuliffe was higher than the Democratic
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:14.560]   turnout four years ago for the Democrat who won the the turnout that uh in New Jersey was higher
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.600]   than what Murphy got four years ago when he won the problem the Democrats have is that Republican
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.860]   turnout was extremely high even without Trump showing that Trump doesn't matter that much
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.160]   uh to turn out and the Independence came out in
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:33.520]   a big way for Republicans so this idea that Democrats can just win elections by delivering
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:39.100]   you know uh programs for their base that's not going to work so I think that's a misperception
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:44.260]   I think Van Jones has the right idea they need to triangulate but you turn the channel to MSNBC
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.980]   and they were just blaming the whole thing on white supremacy basically hysterical
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:53.140]   um just on the detracking thing this shows to me a severe lack of creativity
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:57.100]   you if you look at what happened in the NBA they had this developmental
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:01.180]   league which they didn't kind of run then became the G League they now have the ability to bring
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.640]   players fluidly from the Warriors G League team up to the Warriors or the Knicks team up to the
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:12.400]   Knicks what this means is you don't have to say there's two different tracks and the the two never
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.980]   shall meet in the season they can move up and down in math a very easy solution to this would
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:22.540]   be to have the high track for high performers have the regular track and then spend with all
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:27.040]   this money we have say hey every school is going to be open from three to five o'clock
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.520]   four days a week if anybody wants to attempt to get into a higher track of math just stay after
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.320]   school for two hours anybody can go and get one-on-one tutoring and just double the number
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.660]   of teachers the whole country wants excellence they don't want leveling they don't want equity
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:48.460]   they don't want a quality of results they want to have a quality of opportunity people to move
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:53.200]   up they do want to see that's true and that's students and immigrants do better at math that's
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.980]   what you're missing yes and that's about a quality of opportunity absolutely no it's not
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.760]   just about a quality of opportunity they're so far behind statistically that you need to do
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:05.320]   something new what we're doing is not working David that's why people are picking this bad
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.960]   decision they are eliminating advanced math because they don't want to actually look at
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.460]   the the problem what do you see the problem is well if there's an underperformances starting
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:19.960]   group then you should work hard to raise them up not eliminate the subject give me a suggestion
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.380]   charters and school choice okay look I mean if you're if you're going to define structural racism
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.740]   as conditions that that trap people of color in poverty across Generations seems like a pretty
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:38.140]   fair definition then you have to say the number one cause of structural racism is the school system
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:43.720]   education yeah it's the school system because we know poor kids are trapped in schools that aren't
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.280]   very good why because they're controlled by the education unions they don't have a choice they
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:54.040]   don't have money so who is making that argument uh on the on the side of the left no one why
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.860]   because everyone knows the unions especially the education unions
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:00.760]   are the number one donor to the Democratic Party so the Democrats won't even look at this problem
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:06.940]   all they'll do is the way is blame white supremacy could build their base is by saying we want to fix
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:10.960]   education that would be if you they are education what do you think young industry in Virginia by
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:18.280]   the way 55 of Hispanics in Virginia voted for Youngkin so minorities are shifting on this issue
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:26.800]   based on charters and school choice private chat these are the new quality of life issues if Youngkin has a good four years
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.060]   in Virginia he can run for president and crush this thing can I show you just one chart and then
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:36.760]   we can get off the politics thing which is it was this chart from this guy Patrick uh Ruffini who's a
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.860]   pollster and I think it really illustrates the problem that progresses the Democratic Party for
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:50.080]   the listeners okay so what this chart shows is it basically shows where the Democratic the Democratic
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.540]   Party is in the Senate Republican Party is in relation to the center of the country okay and
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.740]   basically as you'd expect
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:04.300]   in a democracy whichever party is closer to five wins okay so in 1994 when Bill Clinton was president
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.760]   the Democratic Party the center of it was smack dab as five the Republicans weren't that far away
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:16.060]   they were a six so the party even though there was a lot of partisan warfare the the political
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:21.280]   differences actually weren't that great and Clinton I think more accurately found that dead
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.680]   Center okay fast forward to 2004 so George W Bush is president now the Democrats are
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:32.980]   at four Republicans are at five that's why Republicans won okay now go to 2017 these poll
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:39.220]   numbers he did and this is a few years ago the Democrats are all the way at two okay and the
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:43.900]   Republicans are at six and a half so it's true that both parties have moved away from the center
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:48.400]   but Republicans are one and a half points away from the center whereas Democrats are three
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.360]   points away so the Democrats have actually moved further away from the center if you
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.620]   look at who are the activists in the Democratic Party who is the base who is
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.780]   the energy who does all the work who does the contributions it is the progressives right this
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:07.480]   is why McAuliffe ran as McAuliffe is not a progressive he was a Clinton Democrat you
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:12.820]   know going way back to the 90s okay he was Bill Clinton's you know right-hand man in the party
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:19.300]   back in the 90s but he nevertheless ran as a progressive in Virginia who supported the
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:23.320]   teachers unions why because he was appealing to the base of the party Gavin Newsom did the
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.560]   same thing in California Gavin was never a Bernie bro he
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:32.080]   I mean he's always been liberal but he he has moved very far left and Biden has moved very
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.840]   far left as president why is that because the base of the party has moved very far left so
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:45.100]   unless that gets fixed I see maybe the party's base but not the country's exactly so you're
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:51.220]   going to need a strong Democrat who can basically give the Heisman to that part of the base or
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.060]   they're going to keep losing elections I think this could be a Republican decade I know it
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.500]   doesn't seem like it right now because
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.480]   you had Trump and the Republicans lost but look how quickly the Republicans turned around their
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:08.440]   electoral fortunes so with Trump on the sidelines then that's just a huge detriment yes if Trump is
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.240]   the nominee in 2024 all bets are off but in 2022 he's not the nominee he's still
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.200]   censored from social networks he's really nowhere in sight and people people have a very short
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:26.440]   um memory it turns out they've moved on very quickly Young can check the box because he felt he
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:32.260]   had to to get the nomination and to run on the Republican platform but then you think Young
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:37.900]   is going to talk to Trump once no not once and I and I think and I honestly think this election is
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.780]   going to help Republicans move past Trump because what Republican believes in um in like that the
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:49.180]   electoral system is rigged now right I mean all these blue cities and states just delivered big
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.880]   results for Republicans so where exactly is the ballot stuffing where exactly is the stole where
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.360]   the stolen elections that's gonna that's gonna stop now too they're gonna stop it's gonna stop
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.220]   overnight right because I mean by the way Kristen cinema probably knows this like you know the the
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:07.720]   the funny thing about all of this is when Peter Teal put in 10 million dollars into this pack for
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.880]   Blake Masters who used to work for him and said you know in Arizona I'm gonna run this guy against
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:20.800]   you cinema attacked hard to the center instantly so she she knew too yeah well so just just a small
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.140]   point of course so Blake is running against uh the other guy um the astronaut guy I'm facing on his
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:31.360]   name but but yeah but but cinema is up so to speak uh in the next election cycle so she got a little
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:37.060]   bit more time but you're right like cinema is attuned and Mansion is attuned they are some of
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:42.160]   the few Democrats that are attuned to where the center of the country is you heard Mansion in the
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.260]   wake of this election said this is a center-right country these guys better wake up um you know they
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:50.740]   should really now look I think I think what's going to happen in the wake of this election is
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:55.060]   that this infrastructure bill is going to sail through because one of the crazier things that
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:59.500]   the progressives were doing was holding that bill hostage it might have helped McAuliffe I don't
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.100]   think it would have I don't think McAuliffe would have won but it might have helped him by a point
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.880]   or two if they had gotten that infrastructure bill done because a lot of those programs are
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.920]   going to be popular in a state like Virginia okay but I mean but but I think that you know
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.580]   this house reconciliation bill they just seemed hell-bent on jamming it through with all these
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:20.680]   tax increases I don't I don't think that's not popular you know what the big issue in New Jersey
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:25.000]   for them yeah one of the big issues in New Jersey where you almost had this upset within one point
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:33.340]   was taxes you know um there was a a gaffe by Murphy who said something like you know he said he said
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:38.020]   that if if taxes are someone's chief concern he said quote maybe we're not your state can you
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:43.540]   imagine that wow and he almost lost the election because of that so I don't think all these big tax
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:50.020]   increases are what the country wants and you know if Biden insists on allowing Bernie to dominate
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:58.180]   Warren I think it's gonna you're gonna see 40 to 50 seat losses by the Democrats in 2022. okay moving
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:06.400]   on to our final topic crazy update out of China a research team has developed a method of converting
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:12.040]   carbon dioxide into starch Science magazine published this paper from a research team 100
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:20.560]   grams of catalysts converting five grams of CO2 per hour into starch um and uh freeberg I saw you
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.960]   said that this is 10 times more efficient than corn plants uh what's the impact of something
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:34.120]   like this could it hit scale would it have an impact on food security carbon global warming
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.940]   yeah so I tweeted this paper out because it's just it's a fantastic demonstration of what's
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.980]   possible in this new emerging not emerging it's been around for a long time but kind of
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:50.500]   you know in the state of art in um in biomanufacturing you know photosynthesis
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:56.380]   is the system by which most starch is produced on planet Earth today that is plants convert sunlight
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:03.640]   and use water and carbon dioxide to make starches and starches um and and sugars which are what
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:09.460]   carbohydrates are account for 60 percent of human calories and we get all those calories from rice
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:14.860]   wheat potatoes which you know are grown on about 60 percent of our acres that we farm on planet
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:20.140]   Earth so you know in in plants there's a series of these chemical reactions and what these guys did is
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   um isolated and created a couple of specific proteins which are a class of proteins called
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.660]   enzymes and what an enzyme is is it's a protein that can take different molecules and combine them
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:39.700]   and re and force them to react and make something new and they identified a couple of enzymes and
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.960]   engineered a few enzymes and put them together in a cell-free system meaning there's no cells
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:50.380]   involved it's just a tank with a bunch of fluids in it and and they stick in some carbon dioxide
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:55.000]   that they can suck in from the atmosphere and they um they can and they have to drive it with
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.460]   some hydrogen gas which we can just get from water and the system basically converts that
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:06.580]   carbon dioxide into starch which is uh being done at a rate that's almost 10 times higher than what
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:12.220]   we see with um with corn plants so it's it's an incredible demonstration there's there's several
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.780]   steps to the system like six steps and I did some back of the envelope math and my back of
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:20.320]   the envelope math on what they've demonstrated and and by the way everything they did
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.240]   is publicly available for reproducibility so people are going to try and resource open
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.460]   source so people are going to try and copy this now but my back of the envelope math is um you
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:37.540]   know uh this system can produce about 10 grams of starch per liter per day which would mean it
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:44.920]   would take about 2.7 trillion liters to suck up all of the carbon dioxide that all of humans are
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.260]   putting in the atmosphere every year from all of industry that would require um about 27
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:55.720]   million tanks that are about 40 feet tall and about 8 feet wide that whole all of those tanks
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:01.360]   could fit in an area about 25 by 25 miles you could attach one nuclear reactor to it to suck
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:08.200]   up the uh the water and convert it into hydrogen gas and feed this system and those tanks 25 miles
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:15.040]   by 25 miles would take out all of the carbon dioxide on planet Earth and convert it into usable
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.720]   starch and that starts by the way that system could be tuned not just to make starch for consumption it
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.820]   could make biofuels it could be used to make bioplastics it could be used to make anything
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:30.220]   that's hydrocarbon based um and so you can kind of think about this being the entry point to a
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.960]   series of production systems that we could use to make stuff why did they open source it
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:40.360]   so they're a research team of scientists from China and they've been iterating on this this
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:46.780]   process this isn't the only process right and so what they're showing is that this is possible
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:50.140]   and what I think we will see is a lot of people
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:55.000]   battling their brains now saying not only do we use proteins and enzymes that we find in nature
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.020]   but we're going to start to engineer our own proteins and our own enzymes that are even more
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:03.700]   efficient than what we see in nature and that's what's starting to happen this system alone what
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:09.820]   I just described this 25 mile by 25 mile system which is tiny is the equivalent of starch production
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:15.520]   from 42 U.S corn belts if you took all the corn growing in the United States it's 42 times that
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.240]   um is what it would produce that's my back of the envelope math of kind of what these guys did
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:25.180]   um and so I think what they're showing is this is incredibly yeah yeah and and the implications we
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:29.200]   could go in a hundred directions and we could talk for an hour about what this means and what
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:34.600]   you could do with it but I think it it really catalyzes this this point that that that we're
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.840]   kind of everyone's always like how are we gonna get all this carbon out of the atmosphere what
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.700]   are we gonna do with this where there's a will there's a way the science is here today 27
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.420]   million tanks made out of plastic you could probably get that stuff produced you know a
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:50.020]   couple billion dollars find a piece of land that's 25 by 25 miles that's near the end of the year and
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:54.460]   it's near some water and put a nuclear power plant there and you could suck up all the CO2 in the
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:58.300]   atmosphere anybody want to take anyone but you want to take a guess of how many people on the
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:04.420]   team were in advanced math courses the funny thing about this that I think is really interesting is
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:09.700]   that it came at the same week where we were ending you know what was this political theater of cop 26
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:19.600]   you know Greta Thunberg uh who's you know how dare you how dare you she had this very funny comment
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.100]   like uh you know it was a bunch of corporate nonsense and the same old blah blah blah was
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:30.880]   her description of cop 26. you know we had this great trickle of like you know agreements there
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:37.120]   was like on Monday there was an agreement to stop deforestation uh and then you realize it's a non-binding
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.320]   agreement and you're like oh okay well I guess we're not gonna stop deforesting we're just gonna
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.140]   keep you know doing that and all of this stuff just kind of like took a lot of my enthusiasm
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.900]   um and I was a little despondent
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:53.620]   about what was going on and then when I saw this thing I was I was really quite impressed
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:59.260]   I will say that there's a very tricky thing happening right now which is that developing
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:05.260]   countries basically said listen if you want us to go after climate change we want 1.3 trillion
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:10.720]   dollars a year to support us and so you know the western world will have to figure out whether
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.860]   we're willing to pay you know what is the equivalent of you know six or seven percent
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:19.840]   of U.S GDP to a whole bunch of other countries every year for them to slow down and
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:23.620]   if we don't make these payments to India and China and a bunch of other developing nations
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:28.060]   they they have said we're just going to continue to do what we're going to do here's an idea take
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:32.500]   half of that money and put it towards science yeah take half that money and go build a plant
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:37.360]   that uses this system that was just demonstrated and put it in South Texas and suck up ocean water
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.160]   and convert that ocean water into hydrogen gas great jobs by the way ocean water can be turned
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:46.240]   into hydrogen gas by running electricity through it so you're putting a nuclear power plant to
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.900]   protect the electricity you run it through ocean water you create hydrogen gas you pump it into
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:54.580]   these freaking tanks and it sucks up all the CO2 and it makes stuff that humans can consume and
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:59.320]   that we can use and suddenly you have this abundance of material you have this abundance of
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:04.600]   food and you can turn this and jobs and you can turn this into a lot of different things and you
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.840]   know this kind of goes to the point I've been making for a while if we want to invest in
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:13.240]   infrastructure this is the sort of thing that both solves climate change creates jobs and has
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:19.060]   extraordinary economic return potential built into it so how does it get politicians re-elected
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:23.620]   you know I think the private market may come after this stuff I'll be honest I'm you know I'm like I'm
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:27.100]   talking to people looking at this being like why don't we make a plant that we can make biofuels
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:31.000]   and bioplastics and food and other stuff out of this uh this technique and there's going to be
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.460]   other iterations of this technique um but it's such a no-brainer cost like a functional prototype of
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:42.040]   this like a small prototype nothing right I mean a couple million bucks yeah like nothing so um
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.180]   the other thing
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:48.160]   that happened this week beyond this request for 1.3 trillion dollars is that you know we're now
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.340]   seriously considering carbon tariffs and we talked about this on a pod before but
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:56.680]   you know I've said I think this is the most disruptive thing in the capital markets and
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:01.060]   and geopolitics that can happen in the next 10 or 20 years is an effective carbon tariff
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:06.220]   which is to say that when a good or service enters the borders of a country they will
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:12.880]   levy some tax that they think represents its drag on the environment and so you know
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.320]   um the simple example would be a car you know you make a car you make a Tesla
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:25.420]   in Texas but the minute it crosses the border to Canada Canada says well here's the true carbon
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:30.580]   intensity of this car all of the energy that you put into the aluminum to the batteries
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:35.740]   you know to the to the buildings where the engineers sat that were that were building FSD
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:41.680]   and uh you know I'm going to charge an eight thousand dollar tax on this car or iPhones coming
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.000]   to China yeah that's happening I think that's coming so I think that you know the combination
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.300]   of tariffs and these transfer payments is going to create a real economic incentive for folks to
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:57.760]   make these kinds of big technological Leaps so I'm pretty bullish on all of that I'm less bullish on
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.200]   politicians ability to organize because unfortunately again this is the first time I
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:09.400]   really paid attention to cop and it just looked like a bunch of really you know you know it's just
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.180]   a lot of political theater Sachs does this uh science conversation about saving the planet do
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:17.140]   anything for you would you like to get back I mean I think it's the way to solve the problem is you
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:21.940]   have to figure out new Technologies to actually take carbon out of the atmosphere because you're
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:28.180]   not going to do it through you know these political programs I mean you know China India
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:34.480]   paying them and another developing nations 1.3 trillion a year I mean foreign aid already is
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.100]   one of the least popular parts of of the government's budget you're going to now
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:44.260]   pay 1.3 trillion to these countries so that they it's nonsense and you're going to pay
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:52.720]   technology that solves the problem nobody's gonna stand for that yeah and you know the the education
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.940]   system right pour it in yeah I don't think there's a political solution to this problem that's going
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:02.860]   to be palatable to people I think it's going to have to be solved through new technology now let
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:07.960]   me ask you a question freeberg you said there's a six-step process given your experience building
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.800]   science and technology
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.920]   products is it possible for each of those six steps to get but 20 percent more efficient a year
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.680]   yeah look I mean um I just say that to describe that there's a series of steps in the system it
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:27.160]   you know um but uh at the end of the day this is a demonstration of science that has been you
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:31.960]   know probably funded to some small amount but you know if you start to iterate on this approach and
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.220]   think big picture and think infrastructure solution here uh there's a lot of room for
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.500]   improvement I'm sure so in other words you're back of the
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:45.820]   envelope 25 by 25 mile if this is getting 50 more efficient 25 more efficient year over year we could
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:51.580]   see it becoming you know uh twice as efficient every two to three years and your 25 mile might
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.000]   be a five mile radius City I mean think about going to Mars right what are we going to do in
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.040]   Mars we're not going to grow friggin fields of corn and grow cows and stuff right you're going
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.820]   to need a system that literally takes the molecules that are in the atmosphere there
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:08.200]   uses some electricity that's probably going to be produced by a nuclear power plant and convert those
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.940]   molecules into what you want to make and consume and that's what we can do on Earth today the
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:16.720]   systems are going to get better they're going to get cheaper they're going to get faster and that's
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:22.060]   why I'm highly optimistic about solutions to climate change in the century it's not about an
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.560]   if it's about a when and you know the when is going to be defined by the willpower of how we
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.520]   are going to allocate our people and our capital resources to solve these problems in the near term
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.900]   we have the tools to do it I love the fact that we're sort of hitting this fork in the road
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:37.900]   where it's like do we just want to give the money to a bunch of governments
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:42.280]   to pretend they're going to solve this and grifters or do we want to put it into science
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:48.220]   technology Innovation and entrepreneur hand entrepreneur former that execute execute
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:54.760]   what'd you say I picked the former we should yeah let's give it to politicians who don't know what
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:59.320]   the they're doing I mean it really is like when you know I don't know if you saw Elon say like
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.340]   yeah if you want to solve world hunger can you make us can you make a spreadsheet let's talk
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:07.600]   about that that's just so beautiful I thought that was like the greatest that's dunk of the week
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.700]   nothing nothing gets me up in the morning like funding shenanigans right tell the story I mean
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:17.560]   just somebody was like oh Elon you know made more money Tesla stocks no no an article it was an
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.100]   article that was written sure and then he's like well if you want to solve world hunger I'm willing
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.420]   to sell shares Jason can you describe it you're doing such a shitty job today as a moderator what
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:30.880]   are you talking about all I did was put assist in your hands you guys dunked everything that's it I'm
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.700]   out there was an article's voice do it in his voice yeah hey guys and there was an article so
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:44.200]   there was an article that was written that basically said you know um you know 6.8 billion
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:53.200]   dollars uh which is you know what Elon made like in a day or something could cure world hunger and
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:59.800]   then the head of the you know uh U.N World Food Program retweeted that again trying to further
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.400]   Dunk on Elon and then um Elon responded well if you can just show me a plan and just please reply
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.680]   in line here on Twitter and it's credible and detailed I'll just sell you know this stock and
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.620]   I'll give it to you and uh everybody was like oh my God there was this oh my God moment like wow
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:23.560]   can this really happen ending world hunger sounds like a beautiful idea it can only does only cost
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.120]   you know 6.8 billion dollars and obviously it went nowhere because the guy didn't have a plan and it
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:36.100]   was just a complete joke but that's what happened yeah and he's like yeah just put all of your uh put
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:42.940]   all of your expenses out there show us your plan and it was like oh crickets nothing all right
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:48.940]   everybody on behalf of the dictator Chamath polyhapitia the queen of quinoa the Sultan of
