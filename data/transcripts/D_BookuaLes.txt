[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, professing Christians and pastors and churches all over the world are undermining the glory of God's love.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   How so? By advocating for God's love in denial of his other attributes and actions.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   That's what Pastor John explains today in a clip from his 1999 sermon on Romans 5, verses 9-11.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Today's clip was sent to us from a longtime podcast listener named Grant Harms.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And the sermon is based on Romans 5, verses 9-11.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Let me read this glorious text first, then we'll listen to the clip.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   "Since therefore we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   More than that, more than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   through whom we have now received reconciliation."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Pastor John is about to expound this main text in a moment after he makes a point from the book of Revelation.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Here now is Pastor John.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Revelation chapter 20, verse 15 says this, "If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   he was thrown into the lake of fire."
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   What's that? What's that like?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Chapter 14, verse 10 of Revelation describes what it will be like in the lake of fire.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   "They will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever."
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   This is fire or like fire?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I've heard some people say fire is just a metaphor.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I say just a metaphor.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Just a metaphor.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   What are metaphors for?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What are metaphors for?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Metaphors are because you can't describe the reality.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Metaphors don't overstate, they understate.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Just a metaphor.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It says fire, not because it's less than fire,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   but because we're groping for language to describe the horror of it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Okay, it's a metaphor, but if it's a metaphor, it's worse than fire.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And it's torment, and it's forever.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   No getting out.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   This is not purgatory, which doesn't exist.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Forever and ever.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's the strongest word for eternity in the Greek language.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's a phrase. Phrase upon phrase.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Forever and ever and ever.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   This is terrifying.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Terrifying.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Terrifying.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And the question is, who will rescue us?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Who are you counting on to rescue you from the wrath of God?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Because your conscience tells you,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   you have not lived up to his law, and you are under judgment.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You don't need the Bible to tell you that, though it does.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Who are you counting on to rescue you from the wrath of God?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Now the answer of the New Testament is that there is one person who can rescue us from the wrath of God,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and only one.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   God.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Only God can rescue us from the wrath of God.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Let me show you why I say that.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There are five main verbs in verse 9 and 10,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and they're all passive.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Let's count them.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Having now been justified, one,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   shall we be saved, two,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   if while we were enemies we were reconciled, three,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   to God through the death of his Son, much more having been reconciled, four,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   shall we be saved, five.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Five passive verbs where we are being acted upon.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   We are being justified, we are being reconciled, we are being saved.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   So who's doing it?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   The Father or the Son?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Answer, the Father.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Why do I say that?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   God the Father is justifying, reconciling, and will save from His wrath.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Why do I say that?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Look at verse 10.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It says, "We were reconciled to God through the death of His Son."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Now you wouldn't say that if the Son were the actor here of the reconciling.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   You don't say, "The Son reconciled us to God through the Son."
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   You can't say that. That doesn't make sense.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   The Son reconciled us to God through His Son.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   You say, "God the Father reconciled us to God through His Son."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And so I say, "Who is the Savior from wrath?"
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   God the Father saves us from His wrath.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Oh, this is important.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It shouldn't surprise us.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Look at verse 8. We're not on verse 8 this week, but we've been on it.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Verse 8, "God demonstrates His love toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   God loves you.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And God is so angry with you,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   that His love will rise to the heights of rescuing you from His anger.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now let me make something really clear here, because this is so important.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Don't make the mistake of defending the love of God by denying the wrath of God.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Because what you do when you try to defend the love of God by denying the wrath of God is destroy the love of God.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Why? Because in the Bible, the highest point of the love of God is His rescue from the wrath of God.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   If there's no wrath, the whole fabric of the Bible unravels.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   The greatest love that God ever showed you was rescuing you from wrath.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's the point of verses 6 to 8, is it not?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Oh, there's so many people, there's so many people who try to rescue God as a God of love by denying the fabric of the Bible.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   By denying the wrath of God.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You destroy it, at least the way the Bible conceives of it.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   The highest point of love toward you was the cross.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And the only reason there had to be a cross is because of the just wrath of God.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Were there no just wrath about to be poured out upon the world, He would not have bruised His Son.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And that was love. Oh, that was love.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So please, please let's not join the crowd of liberalism.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I'm defining liberalism for you. If you wonder, "What's liberalism?" I'm defining it.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Liberalism removes the just wrath of God and the substitutionary atonement that describes the love of God as the rescue from that wrath.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It has a benevolent Father and a Son who sets an example of how much the Father loves in suffering.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   That is a destruction of biblical religion entirely.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Amen. Pointed critique, very necessary.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   That clip was from a John Piper sermon titled "Much More Shall We Be Saved by His Life" preached on December 12th, 1999.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   The clip was sent in by Grant Harms. Grant, thank you.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "Hello Tony and Pastor John," he writes, "in the evenings my wife and I are listening through Pastor John's sermons on Romans."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Great series.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We just finished sermon number 58, so we're only about 167 more to go.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   "This clip is great at explaining why portraying God as only a God of love and not also a God of wrath actually robs Him of His greatest demonstration of love, that is, dying to save us from His wrath."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Amen, Grant. Great find. Thank you.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   All our clips are not crowdsourced.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper sermons caught your attention or changed your life, and we share that clip with the ABJ audience.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And if you have one, email me.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio, and tell me how it impacted your life.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email, and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Well, if my repentance is genuine, why do I keep confessing this same sin?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And if my repentance was genuine, wouldn't I stop committing the same sins?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I don't know of any Christian who has not asked these types of questions before, and I'll ask it of John Piper next time.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We're rejoined in studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   We'll see you then.
