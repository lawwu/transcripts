[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Well, cue the Mission Impossible theme track because John Pfeiffer went undercover.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.200]   Well, not really.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.300]   No disguises were used, but Pastor John, you recently attended a mainline church service
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.760]   here in the Twin Cities, and I'm curious, and I'm sure there's many others who are curious
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.700]   out there to get a debrief of your experience and what you saw.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.240]   So tell us about it and tell us the circumstances which led you there in the first place.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.800]   Since our church has a Saturday night service and my wife was out of town, I was feeling
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.200]   perhaps especially venturesome a couple of weeks ago and decided to go to our church
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.960]   on Saturday night and then go to a mainline Protestant church, downtown Minneapolis.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.260]   Partly, I think, with the goal of education, that is, I wanted to know firsthand how those
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.700]   in the progressive—that's the word they would use—progressive, inclusive, open,
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.900]   mainline churches actually do their services.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.740]   And partly curiosity, because Noelle and I had visited this church years ago and heard
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.940]   the pastor say about Jesus walking on the water and feeding the 5,000, he just said
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.260]   flat out in the pulpit, "Of course we know that those are early, childlike, pre-scientific
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.440]   days, and we have grown beyond that and understand that what was understood to be miracles once
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.500]   upon a time from a more mature and progressive standpoint are seen as symbols and pointers
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.020]   to God's love and power, not something that actually happened in history."
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.940]   So that's what I wanted to see.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.140]   Do they still talk that way, and how do they do service if they do?
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.660]   So let me give you six snapshots, and the reason I have this here in my mind is because
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.620]   I wrote it up in my journal when I got home.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.220]   Six snapshots, which are not at all the whole experience, but the ones that stuck out to
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.220]   me.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.100]   First, and least important, I think probably, 90% of the people in this comfortably full,
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.240]   magnificently beautiful sanctuary were more or less like me.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.880]   That is, they were probably over 60, they were white, and they were well-dressed.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.520]   Second observation.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   The first hymn we sang was titled "Source and Sovereign, Rock and Cloud," and the refrain,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.280]   four times, went like this, "May the church at prayer recall that no single holy name,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.560]   but the truth behind them all, is the God whom we proclaim."
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   Third observation.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.640]   In spite of the invisibility of young families, they did have a children's message with the
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.380]   children gathered at the front, and in the story to the children, the woman who was telling
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:33.300]   the story said that God has hopes like we have hopes, and sometimes our hopes are frustrated
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.580]   and they don't come true, and sometimes God's hopes are frustrated and they don't come true,
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.980]   but you children can, quote, I wrote this down, "put the pieces of God's heart back
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.020]   together," unquote, "if you will share with each other and be good."
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.620]   Fourth observation.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.260]   Before the Old Testament reading and the New Testament reading, the pastor said, quote,
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.420]   "Listen for the word of God," unquote.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.820]   Fifth observation.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.100]   During the pastoral prayer, the first thing, or one of the first things, right at the front
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.980]   of his prayer was something like, I think I wrote this phrase down exactly, "We bless
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:27.460]   you, O God, for the beautiful diversity of the gender spectrum," close quote.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.540]   Final observation.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.380]   There was no sermon, but rather the senior pastor and a Muslim leader of a mosque in
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.540]   North Minneapolis, although they don't use the word mosque anymore, you can look up and
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.020]   see what it's called, stood and had a 25-minute conversation.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.180]   Rather on one side of the pulpit, the imam on the other side of the pulpit, what they
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.420]   called a conversation on hope.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.660]   No mention of any substantive differences between Christ and Muhammad or any differences
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.140]   between the way of salvation in Christianity and Islam or between Allah and the God and
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.620]   Father of Jesus or between the Quran and the Bible.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.260]   How it stirred hope in the face of sin and suffering and death, I couldn't see.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.100]   So those are my six observations.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:24.740]   Now it seems to me that each one of those six features of this service points to a serious
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.500]   problem in what they themselves would call progressive or inclusive or open mainline
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.740]   churches.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.460]   And I don't mean to say that these problems are unique to such churches, since some of
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.580]   them characterize other kinds of churches, even ones that fly under the banner of evangelical
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.940]   sometimes.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.100]   So let me just tick off the six problems that correspond to those six observations as I
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.100]   saw it and thought about it.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.900]   First, it seems to me that the refrain of the hymn that we sang in the context of this
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.780]   service is intended to communicate that there is no uniqueness to Jesus Christ and his way
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.940]   of salvation in the sense that if you don't know it and follow it, you will perish.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.220]   In other words, that's not believed.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:29.460]   I think this church would deny that all those who reject Jesus as God and as the only way
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.220]   to God are forever lost.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.460]   I think they would deny that.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.060]   Whatever Jesus is, knowing him and trusting him in his saving work is not essential, not
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.980]   necessary to eternal life.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.180]   He's just one possible way for sincere seekers to get to God.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.740]   That's the first observation which I think was expressed in that refrain.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:01.100]   Second, the children's lesson points to a view of God that minimizes his transcendence
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.940]   and maximizes his likeness to us.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:11.340]   The primary issue in this church does not seem to be the massive chasm between us and
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:19.220]   God that needs to be overcome by saving mediation and substitution through the work of Jesus,
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.740]   but rather the warmth and acceptance of a God who's not so different from us.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.220]   Third observation or third problem, the view of the Bible from the words introduced at
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.380]   the beginning of the readings, "Listen for the Word of God," probably reflects the
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.740]   view—used to be called neo-Orthodox—the view that the Bible contains the Word of God
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.620]   rather than being the Word of God.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.020]   So everyone in the congregation is allowed to decide for themselves what parts of the
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.300]   Bible reading are in fact God's Word.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.300]   So listen for it.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:03.460]   You might spot some Word of God in this religious reading that I'm about to give from the
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.460]   Bible.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:13.580]   Fourth, praising God for the beautiful diversity of the gender spectrum in the context of the
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:21.580]   21st century America suggests that in this church, sexual identity—who we are as male
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:29.300]   and female—sexual identity has been cut loose from God's revelation in nature and
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.820]   in Scripture.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:38.020]   So like the Bible, sexuality is whatever you make it out to be, and wherever you choose
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.820]   to be on the whole spectrum is fine.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.460]   It's beautiful.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:51.180]   Fifth, the emptiness of the conversation with the Muslim leader points to the fact that
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:57.020]   in the view of this church, contemporary Christianity does not have to do mainly with ultimate reality.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.020]   It just doesn't.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.140]   It's not a metaphysical issue.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.260]   It's not an ultimate reality issue.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.700]   The nature of God, the nature of Christ, the nature of salvation, the path of holiness,
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:13.900]   the nature of eternal destinies, that is simply not the issue in contemporary mainline Protestantism.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:23.060]   Rather, the dynamics that define relationships between social groups is front and center.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.100]   That's really the issue, not ultimate reality.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:34.780]   And finally, the fact that this church is made up mainly of old people suggests, at
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:45.100]   least at the present, that many younger people doubt the validity of traditional religious
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:54.620]   forms that no longer embody the claim to offer ultimate truth and ultimate reality and ultimate
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.780]   salvation.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.680]   And I think that they are absolutely right to try to maintain the forms.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.820]   And if you walked into that church and you didn't know any better, you'd say, "This
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.060]   looks like a church from forever.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.420]   This is what church is.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.780]   Big stained glass windows and pastors at the front, a big organ, lots of music, singing
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.680]   about Jesus.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.420]   What could be more churchy than this?"
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.820]   Except there's nothing there of any ultimate reality.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:30.700]   There's so much more that we could say, but perhaps that will suffice for a glimpse into
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:41.300]   what has become of the once dominant and now fading mainline Protestant tradition in America.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:47.580]   Well, tragic observations, but a helpful report card to check our own susceptibilities when
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.580]   it comes to making assumptions about God is frightening.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.900]   Thank you for sharing with us these thoughts, Pastor John, and thanks for joining us today.

[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.320]   When we return, we have a question from a listener in Sri Lanka who asks about how he
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.480]   should honor a Buddhist priest in his country, which is typically done with a revered bow.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.820]   When citizens come across these priests in public, should he honor them or should he
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.380]   stub them?
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.440]   It opens a globally relevant discussion about how we appropriately honor people around us
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.700]   who hold false views about God.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.020]   That's when we return on Friday.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.580]   We'll see you then.
