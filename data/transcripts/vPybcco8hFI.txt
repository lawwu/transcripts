[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   A few years ago, Pastor John was asked if he had any concerns or cautions for this new Calvinism movement.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And he did. Here's what he had to say.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Oh yeah, and I'll give you one that's just fresh off a prophetic word that was given to me yesterday.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   You know, take it or leave it for whatever. I'm cautious about things when people come to me with these kinds of things.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   But it rung true, and you can get it without having any claim to special divine authority.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Making theology God instead of God God.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Loving doing theology rather than loving God.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Somebody said to me one time, Sam Crabtree, it was.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   The danger of the contemporary worship awakening is that we love loving God more than we love God.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   That was very profound.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And you might love thinking about God more than you love God.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Or arguing for God more than you love God.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Or defending God more than you love God.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Or writing about God more than you love God.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Or preaching more than you love God.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Or evangelizing more than you love God.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Reformed people tend to be thoughtful.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   That is, they come to the Bible and they want to use their minds to make sense of it.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And the best want to make sense of all of it.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Not pick and choose and say, I don't like that verse.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   That's not like an Arminian verse. We'll put that over here.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Well, no. No. You fix your brain. You don't fix the Bible.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   So being that kind of person that we're prone to systematize and fit things together.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Those kinds of people, me, are therefore wired dangerously to begin to idolize the system.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And I don't want to go here too much because I think the whiplash starts to swing the other direction.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And so minimize system and minimize thinking and minimize doctrine that we start losing a foothold in the Bible.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So that would be a big caution that we be intellectually and emotionally more engaged with the person of Christ,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   the person of God, the Trinity, than we are with thinking about Him.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And they are inextricably woven.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But the reason you're reading the Bible and the reason you're framing thoughts about God from the Bible
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   is to make your way through those thoughts to the real person.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   The danger of those who do the other thing, namely all that intellectual stuff,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   no, no, no, doctrine, no, intellect, no, study, no, experience, yes,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   is that they wind up worshiping a God of their own imagination.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It feels so right. It feels so free. It feels so humble because they're not getting involved in all those debates.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But it isn't. It's losing their grip on reality.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We are compelled to go there.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Hand in glove with that is pride.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I mean, that is a species of pride.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   When I say there are many species of pride, that's just one of them.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You can call it intellectualism if you want.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   There's emotionalism over there. That's not the danger right now.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Intellectualism is a species of pride because we begin to prize our abilities to interpret the Bible over the God of the Bible or the Bible itself.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   When I asked Rick Warren, "Bible, tell me your doctrine of the Bible," he said, "Inerrant, authoritative."
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   But I don't mean all my interpretations of it are inerrant and authoritative.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And that's, of course, right. We should talk that way.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So that would be my flag.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That was Pastor John a few years ago addressing his concerns for this movement called New Calvinism.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And speaking of New Calvinism, we did a recent episode on the theme titled,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   "Where Did All These Calvinists Come From?"
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That was episode number 237 in the Ask Pastor John archive.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   See also the very recent episode, if you haven't heard it already, titled,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   "What's New About New Calvinism?"
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   That was episode number 319, recorded earlier this month.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   We will be back tomorrow to ask, "If I want people in other religions to consider reading the Bible,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   should I then be willing to return the favor and read their holy book?"
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
