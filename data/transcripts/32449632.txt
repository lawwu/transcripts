[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.280]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.200]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.840]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.280]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.560]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.560]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.540]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.100]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.320]   But don't forget,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.600]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.600]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.240]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.840]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.720]   Well, listeners, it's that time of year.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.320]   It's transition time.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.440]   And as we transition away from summer
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.200]   and into our community days,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.500]   many of us are dusting off our anti-charts
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.640]   and our memory work.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600]   And I wanna encourage us today
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.440]   to do one thing that I believe
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.920]   will set us all up for success.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   I wanna celebrate something that I really think
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.240]   is a superpower for homeschoolers
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.760]   or really anyone who wants to be a learner for life.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.280]   I wanna talk about books.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.640]   And today I have a fellow enthusiast with me
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.080]   who will hopefully convert you guys too.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.500]   Jennifer Courtney, welcome to "Everyday Educator."
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.340]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.640]   I love when I get to join you.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.680]   - I love it when you and I get to talk about books.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560]   I really, initially,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.800]   I had thought about calling this episode,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.960]   "My Superpower is Keeping the Books."
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.640]   And then I was gonna introduce you
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.080]   as the keeper of the books
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.800]   and say that you would willingly deputize this all.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.520]   But I mean, really, that seemed too nerdy even for us.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.120]   But let me ask you this,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.240]   would you want to be keeper of the books?
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.600]   - Well, you know what I'm gonna do?
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.120]   I'm gonna answer that question by telling a story.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.000]   So- - Yes, that's perfect.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.840]   - A few years back, well, more than a few years back now,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.760]   probably over two decades,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.280]   had a panic attack because digital books
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.360]   were rapidly proliferating and e-readers
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   and bookstores were closing.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.080]   And I stood in a bookstore in my hometown that was closing.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.840]   And I thought, my momentary impulse,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200]   which I did not act on, was to buy all the books.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800]   And I told my husband, which is why we didn't do it.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.000]   But I just had that moment of thinking,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.200]   what if print books were lost?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.440]   And so I did not buy a copy of every book there,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.920]   but I have, ever since that day,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.000]   been concerned that we will lose these resources.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.600]   And so I have been building a library in my home.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.160]   And so, yes, the answer is,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.320]   I would like to be known as the keeper of the books.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.800]   - Yes, and I love that you are building
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.720]   that library in your home.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.000]   So expand a little bit on what keeper of the books
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.880]   would mean and why you think that would be an important job.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.760]   - Yeah, so when I was reading "Animal Farm"
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.720]   with my students in challenge two one year,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.640]   I remember thinking how easy it was for the rulers
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   to take away the constitution
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.680]   that the animals had agreed on,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.600]   by slowly erasing the parts of it.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.840]   And I remember thinking that's kind of what,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.400]   that was my reaction to the digital books and e-readers,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.640]   that it would be, we need to change things.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.320]   And also, as we look at,
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.480]   I was reading C.S. Lewis's "Abolition of Man"
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.480]   and thinking about how we are humans, we are in soul bodies,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.640]   and therefore we like to have incarnate things.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   It's good for us.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.360]   And so between those two readings,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.720]   I began to really think that we need an effort
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.200]   to preserve books.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.520]   And I think that homeschool families
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.400]   are likely to be part of that effort
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.880]   because we do value books
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.040]   and reading them with our families.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.960]   And I already had quite a library going.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.360]   My parents, I'm very fortunate,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.720]   my parents moved around a lot for my dad's work
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.080]   and everywhere they went,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.680]   they took all of my childhood books
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.480]   and then when I had my own home,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.680]   that was the seed for my library that now is in my home.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.560]   - That's great, that's great.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.080]   So you actually had some that you could build on.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   So is that how we become keepers of books?
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.480]   I want you, you've alluded a couple of times
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   to your library and I happen to have seen pictures of it,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.080]   which I envy greatly.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.840]   I want you to talk to us about building a library
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.320]   because I can feel lots of us thinking,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.200]   what do you mean by that?
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.480]   Do you just have lots of books in your house?
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.240]   Do you have lots of bookshelves?
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   I had one of my girl's friends ask one time,
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.960]   y'all have a lot of books.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.160]   Do you just have books everywhere?
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.520]   And my daughter opened up a cabinet in the living room
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.360]   that you couldn't see unless you opened the door
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.240]   and showed them more books
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.600]   and then she opened a door in our house and said,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.560]   this is the unfinished part of the basement.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   We have shelves between the slats in the basement
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.160]   and this child's eyes got really big.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.640]   But what does that mean?
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.360]   Tell us about your library
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.080]   and how we could become keepers of the books.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.680]   - Yeah, so like you, I have had a lifetime
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.120]   of having books all over my house, in closets, in cabinets,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.280]   sometimes on the floor,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.640]   although I don't love it when that happens.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.400]   Between my collection that I started with
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   of children's books and then I majored in English literature
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.040]   so I had a lot of books from that.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.600]   And then when I became a homeschool parent
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   and was researching homeschooling and classical education,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.880]   I acquired more books.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.080]   And over the years, of course,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.640]   I've acquired many books to read with my children.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.960]   So this past spring,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.880]   I got to have a lifelong dream fulfilled.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.920]   My husband and I started shopping for bookcases
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.800]   and rolling library ladders
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   because we finally--
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.480]   - Oh.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.400]   - I have many, like you, I have many children
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.600]   that are growing up and leaving me
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.200]   so I finally had a space where I could do this.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.080]   And so we bought the shelves
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   and then my daughter who is in her last year of college,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.920]   over Christmas break,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.520]   she inventoried all of our books on a digital app.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.760]   And then my parents came over.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.320]   This is quite a whole family effort.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.280]   So my husband--
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.360]   - That's what I was gonna say.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.680]   Everybody's in on this.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.520]   - Everyone is.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.880]   My husband did the shelves and built the rail
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.040]   for the ladder.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.920]   My daughter inventoried the books
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.720]   and then my children and my parents
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.160]   sat around my dining room table
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.440]   and we covered all of the children's books in plastic
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.200]   and checkout cards in the front
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.960]   and stamps that showed that they belong in my library
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.840]   so that when this academic year starts,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.240]   homeschool families can begin checking out my books.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.160]   So what is upstairs in the official library
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.720]   are books that I'm willing to loan.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.400]   I still have collector's books in the downstairs
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.480]   and books that I use for work down near me.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.600]   But the library is actually a library
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.280]   where people are already coming
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.120]   and borrowing books that I have.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.080]   - That is, I wonder if people are listening
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.320]   and they're like me, I'm sitting here listening to you
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   and my mouth is sort of hanging open.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.080]   That's the coolest thing ever
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.880]   that you have that in your house,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.840]   like a real room dedicated to books
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.040]   that you are willing to lend out
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.160]   intentionally placed on, I happen to know,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.480]   a beautiful shelving with, my heart's desire,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.000]   a rolling library ladder
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.560]   and you're ready to lend them.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.440]   I love that you are covering the children's books
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.960]   with plastic, knowing that to love a book
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.160]   is a messy thing for a child.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.000]   But I think that's cool that you are super,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.520]   you're not just willing to lend your books,
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.080]   you are preparing to do that intentionally
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.920]   and in an orderly way.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.240]   That's a cool thing.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.080]   - It's very fun.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.360]   So I do have, my library specializes
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.560]   in lots and lots of older children's literature.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.160]   So I have sweet mysteries
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   from the 1930s to the 1950s series for young readers.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.880]   And my mom at first was,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.920]   when she was helping me with the library said,
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.520]   I can't believe you're gonna lend these.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.360]   And my point, what I said to her was,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.320]   they are four children and they're being lost
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.880]   and I want them to be read.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.680]   And if something happens to them, I'll replace them.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.520]   But I don't want them to sit on my shelf.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.880]   I want small children to read them.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.640]   And so I have one very faithful six-year-old
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.720]   who in fact is coming over tomorrow
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.120]   to get her next batch of "Happy Hollister" mysteries
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.920]   from the 1980s. (laughs)
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.520]   So it's really fun to have some repeat customers.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.080]   - That is so dear.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   I like that, that you have,
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.200]   I like what you told your mom
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.760]   that books are made for children to read.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.880]   Children's books are for children to read.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.200]   And if you really are worried that books are being lost,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.840]   the way to fix that is not to hoard them,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.560]   but to share them.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   I like that very much.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:28.120]   So you collected your books from childhood
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.680]   and you described that a little bit as you went along.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.880]   And I found myself thinking, oh yeah, I got books there.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.800]   Oh yeah, I bought a lot of books there.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.760]   Oh, I have those books too.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.680]   I think a lot of us are probably realizing
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.560]   that we have a lot of books.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.040]   How do we go about organizing our books?
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.160]   - Well, that was an interesting quest for me.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.000]   So what I finally decided to do is,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.400]   because I didn't want it,
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.760]   I don't have enough books to really,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.840]   form a Dewey Decimal System, for example.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.680]   - Right.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.520]   - I don't have-
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.360]   - Right, right.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.920]   - I have about 1700 books.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.000]   So at the moment and climbing.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.280]   So what I decided to do is have shelves by genre
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.920]   and so I have a shelf for mysteries,
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.640]   a shelf for contemporary literature,
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.560]   a shelf for older classics,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.960]   a shelf for history and so on.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.120]   And what I did is I put them in order by,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.760]   of course, by author and series.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.280]   So they're alphabetical by author
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.880]   or they're organized by a series.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.640]   But I started with the youngest readers at the bottom shelf
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.240]   and then so that the adult books are on the highest shelves
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.160]   and it goes down until the youngest children
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.800]   are on the bottom shelves where they can reach them.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.440]   I want them to pull them out and look at them
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.640]   and see if they're interested, so.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.040]   - That's good.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.960]   That makes sense.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.320]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.160]   I think that,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.240]   yeah, I think that is,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.400]   I know that for me and my husband,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.760]   organizing all of the books we have,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.000]   has been the hardest thing for us.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.040]   - They get unorganized very easily, don't they?
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.800]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.640]   Yes.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.880]   And you know what else I discovered
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.080]   is that my husband and I have different ideas
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   of the categories of some books
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.600]   or even of the categories that we should have.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.120]   'Cause I love your idea
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.320]   of not using the Dewey Decimal System.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.280]   So because, well, partly because that's a pain
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.000]   and partly because most of us don't know
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.880]   that system very well anymore.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   I love the category system.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.280]   - So were you the one who decided the categories?
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.320]   'Cause that's what my husband and I argue about.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.480]   - Yes, I did.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.680]   And there are some that overlap
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.840]   and I just did the best I could to keep it consistent.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.240]   And right now, because of the size of my library,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.280]   when people come over,
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.600]   I know where things are that they might want.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.760]   So I think you and I have talked about this.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.240]   One of the things I acquired
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.040]   was the landmark history books from the 1950s.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.920]   And so I've had a lot of kids come over
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.520]   and get those for their essential spaces of history
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.120]   or because I read them in conjunction
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.680]   with whatever foundation cycle we're on.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.600]   So it was pretty easy just to put all those
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.960]   in the history section.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.720]   Some of them probably could be in a different category
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   but it was just easier to keep them all together
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.440]   so that children know where to go when they come over.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.600]   - That makes really good sense.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.800]   That way it's easy to find stuff.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.200]   So you collected your books.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.480]   Some of them were gifted to you from childhood, I'm sure.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.200]   And still as an adult, people are giving you books.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.360]   I just gave you a book.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.920]   And then how else do you collect your books?
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Where do you look?
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.160]   - So now that I'm almost an empty nester,
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.760]   I make a lot of trips with my husband on his business trips
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.640]   and I have used bookstores in every town I would go to.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.480]   And so I have some really good places that I go
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.280]   that I tend to know after a couple of trips
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.520]   if they're gonna have the kinds of children's literature
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.360]   I want.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.200]   I do occasionally look at places like eBay or archive books
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.560]   but I do try to go to the used bookstores and support them
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.440]   because I would like them to remain open
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.040]   and because I think they're doing good work
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   as keepers of the books also.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.120]   - That's good.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.480]   - Yeah, so I have some favorites.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.800]   In fact, this weekend, I went to one of my favorites
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.040]   and then found out that just hours later
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.280]   your eldest daughter was there.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.840]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.120]   - With each other, but I did find some good finds there.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.480]   I got some new hardback copies of Andrew Lang's fairy books
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.520]   which I find very charming.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.280]   Yeah, so one thing I forgot to mention to you too
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.960]   about the organization is that I do have a lot
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   of picture books for really young readers,
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.520]   toddler, preschool age, and those I don't organize at all
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.080]   because, and they're on a very low shelf
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.400]   just outside the library out in the landing
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.040]   where they can plop themselves down
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.000]   and pull off whatever they want.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.320]   - That's so good because that's the way little people read.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.600]   They go by the pictures
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.640]   and they go by what looks interesting.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.720]   Yeah, that's so good.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.920]   - There's absolutely no organization to that shelf
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.760]   because I don't want the moms to feel stressed
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.960]   that their children are pulling off 10 and 20 things
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.800]   to look at.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.440]   - You know what, that's really important that we be,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.040]   I can imagine that once I got my shelves
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.920]   just like I wanted them to be,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.760]   I think I would hold my breath or maybe even cringe
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.240]   every time somebody put a book back in the wrong place.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.320]   Do you just have to get over yourself?
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.360]   - Yeah, you just have to keep holding.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.800]   I mean, you know, usually, I mean,
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.120]   I'm not as big as a public library would be.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.720]   I'm still very much at private library status.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.120]   So people bring back four or five books at a time
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.880]   and then my youngest helps me reshelf.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.400]   And a lot of times if I'm,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.920]   a lot of times when people come,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.560]   I'm in work meetings with you and other people.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.320]   - So she's kind of my junior library
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.560]   and she helps people find what they need
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.840]   and takes back the ones they're returning.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.720]   So I've had a limited clientele this past spring
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.680]   while I was getting everything organized.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.960]   And now this fall, I'm gonna open it up wider.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.840]   - That's so fun.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.800]   Do you just tell all your friends
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.720]   or do you tell people in your CC community
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.960]   or in your neighborhood or in your church?
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.000]   How are people finding out about the Courtney Library?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.240]   - I'm trying to go a little bit slowly
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.800]   until I get my feet under me.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.600]   So I started with my CC community and my neighborhood
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.720]   so that I had a good sense of the families that are coming
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.160]   and then I'll open it up to other CC communities
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.640]   in the area 'cause I live in a city
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.720]   where there are lots and lots of CC communities.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.120]   So I can get a lot of traffic just from that.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.200]   And then I'll see about expanding it beyond that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.320]   And there are a few people at church that know.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.160]   - Yeah.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.400]   - So yeah, I'm just kind of spreading the word slowly
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.800]   until we as a family get the hang of this lending gig.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.040]   - Yeah, well, I think that's awesome.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.600]   I wanna ask you this question, why?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.280]   'Cause some people who love books
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   and there are lots of us who love books,
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   but some people really like to keep their books
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.120]   to themselves, why are your books not just for you?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.000]   - Yeah, one of the things that was breaking my heart
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.440]   that I kept hearing from this new generation
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.040]   of homeschool families that's different
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.280]   from probably when you and I were homeschooling
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.400]   is that there are fewer and fewer books
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.000]   on the public library shelves
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.560]   and there are fewer and fewer things that they approve of.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.240]   And that broke my heart a little
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.160]   because we can't all afford to own all the books
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.200]   that we want to read.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.960]   And when children, especially when children are small,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   they can be voracious readers.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.160]   And so they can go through 30 picture books in a week.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.240]   So we can't afford to have all of those.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.400]   And it really broke my heart hearing their stories
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   of things that they wanted to read.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.920]   And then on the other end of the spectrum,
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.800]   I had students in my challenge two, three, and four classes
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.600]   that would get interested in an author and say,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.320]   oh, Mrs. Courtney, do you have George McDonald's Lilith?
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.520]   And I could say, yes, I do.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.360]   And you're welcome.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.560]   - Oh.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.760]   - So I just really had that heart
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.200]   to minister to these families.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.000]   And I have carefully selected the children's books
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.280]   so that the parents don't need to worry
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.240]   about what they're pulling off the shelves.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.640]   So they can be comfortable
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.480]   that knowing that there will be books here
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.240]   and that the books will be ones they would feel comfortable
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.800]   with their kids reading.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.760]   - I love that.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   That's really, that's really good.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.000]   That's a good heart to have.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.080]   Let me ask you this.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.360]   Have you had much trouble with books not coming back?
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.640]   - So far, no,
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.840]   but it's been a pretty tight circle of people I know.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.280]   So they've been worried about getting the books back to me
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.040]   and the inventory will help, you know, that I can,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.720]   I do know who has them and when.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.480]   Whereas in the past, I did lose a lot of books loaning them,
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.320]   but that's because I never made an attempt to know
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.520]   who took it and when they took it, I just loaned them out.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.120]   So, so far the systems are working.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.160]   I am quite sure that will happen at some point
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.280]   as the circle gets wider and then I'll just, you know,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.640]   I'll just replace them.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.840]   - You'll just buy another one.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.760]   - Yeah.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.680]   - Yes, I know some of mine,
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.280]   I've gotten bitten by that before
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.720]   'cause I am a lover of books
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.080]   and I love to give people books I think they will love.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.840]   They say, I like this, I like this kind of thing,
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.800]   I don't like this kind of thing,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.120]   I'm like, I have just the book for you.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.640]   But I have been bitten by people
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.480]   by lending out some of my favorite books and I've lost them.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.520]   And sometimes they were books that were out of print
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.440]   or hard to get and so I haven't been able to replace them.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.200]   So I really, really like your system of library cards
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.440]   with due dates and all that stuff.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.720]   Let me ask you this,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   how does sharing your books change your world?
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.440]   - Well, it's really been a joy
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.800]   to make connections with people.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.560]   So the family of this young one
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.800]   who checks out all my "Happy Hollister" mysteries,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.320]   and by the way, those are very charming,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.680]   they're about a family of five kids and a dog
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.160]   who go around solving mysteries,
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.080]   it's a perfect homeschooling series.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.320]   It's a really strong family element, they're just precious.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.080]   And so it's been fun to see how excited she gets
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.240]   when she realizes how very many there are in the series
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.200]   and how she can continue to work with her friends.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.960]   And then on the other end,
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.280]   the landmark history books that I have
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.320]   were books that my dad devoured as a child
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.520]   and he is rereading them
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.960]   and that's been a precious connection for us
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.600]   to go and talk about these books together.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.000]   So he just finished "The Story of Oklahoma,"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.400]   which is where we live,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.600]   and really enjoyed rereading that childhood classic
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.520]   and then we got to talk about it over dinner
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.840]   and that's been just precious
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.200]   to connect with people about what they're reading.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.440]   - I think that's really great.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.240]   And you know, if you wanna have people
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.480]   to talk to about your books,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.280]   then share your books
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.560]   and then they can have the experience too
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.360]   and then you do have something to talk about.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.840]   I really like that.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.760]   Okay, I want us to turn, I've loved,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.160]   tell me, this is a question I really wanted to know.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.840]   Do you have, and I know your propensity to cheat
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.200]   at these kinds of games and questions, so I'm prepared.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.360]   What is your current favorite or what's,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.000]   I wanted to ask you what's your favorite book
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.840]   in your library, but I know that that would not go well.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   What are you most excited to have in your library?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.120]   - I think I was most excited to get a hold
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.760]   of those landmark history books
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.720]   because they have lovely illustrations
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.440]   and they are keeping American history alive
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.200]   for our families today.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.680]   You know, they were written in an era
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.480]   when patriotism was still the norm.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.320]   And I think it's important for us to preserve
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.560]   the stories of our country's heritage.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.880]   In fact, I was on a words aptly spoken book club yesterday
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.840]   and we were talking about Johnny Tremaine
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.080]   and how as we get further and further away
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.440]   from the American revolution,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.960]   the stories of their sacrifices,
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.880]   the miraculous ways that they were saved are being lost.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.760]   And so I really appreciate having a lot of books
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.800]   for, you know, 10 to 12 year olds in my library
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.560]   that are about the people who formed our country
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.960]   and who explored it as it expanded.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.920]   I just think there's nothing more exciting
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.880]   for young people to read than that.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.960]   - Yes, I love it.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.760]   And I remember reading all of those kinds of books
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.600]   in the public library and in our church library
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.240]   when I was little and biographies of presidents
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.080]   from the time they were little until they were world leaders.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.160]   And I remember reading a biography of Clara Barton
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   and just, it really does form your ideas
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.800]   of what a noble sacrificial leader is or can be
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.760]   and how to grow those virtues from childhood on up.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.120]   And I love it that you are really on a mission
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.360]   to preserve that.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.040]   That's cool.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.240]   - Yeah, I also was fascinated by Clara Barton
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.800]   and Florence Nightingale.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.640]   - Yes.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.040]   - And their adventures in nursing.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.000]   So I love sharing those stories with families.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.040]   I also, you know I'm gonna cheat.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.400]   So I'm gonna say one more thing.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   I did just four weeks ago acquire a hardback copy
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.080]   of "Invincible Louisa" is the award-winning biography
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.400]   from the 1920s about Louisa May Alcott,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.240]   who is one of my all-time favorite authors.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.920]   And I now have a beautiful illustrated hardcover
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.040]   of her biography.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.880]   And my mom said,
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.920]   "Surely you're not going to lend that one out."
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.080]   Surely I am.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.800]   I'm going to put a plastic cover on it
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.640]   and I'm going to show that some young lady
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.960]   who is a lover of Louisa May Alcott
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   will enjoy that book as much as I did as a child.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.360]   - Oh, how wonderful to pass on the thrill
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.000]   that you felt to another young lady.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.840]   That's really special.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.680]   Well, if I get to Oklahoma, I may just check it out myself.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   As homeschoolers, so I know that some of us
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.720]   on the call are just starting out as homeschoolers.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.840]   And so I said at the top of the hour together,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.240]   starting your library could really be the superpower
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.880]   for homeschoolers.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.640]   As we're starting out or while our families are young,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.200]   why is a library such a great place
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.040]   to begin our homeschooling journey?
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:31.760]   - Yeah, so I acquired a set of things
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.280]   when I was very first setting up
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.880]   for our family to homeschool
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.400]   that I felt were very important.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.720]   I got a children's dictionary.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.840]   I got a science encyclopedia,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.040]   a history encyclopedia, an atlas.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.000]   And then I had a couple of what I call books of books.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.200]   One of those is now carried in the CC bookstore
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.120]   and that's "Honey for a Child's Heart"
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.240]   because I knew I needed good recommendations of books.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.480]   So some of those I got from other homeschool parents
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.400]   and people in my church,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.320]   but some of them I got from books of books
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.760]   like "Honey for a Child's Heart."
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   But I felt it was important to have that seed
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.880]   of a reference library
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.520]   so that whenever we were curious about something,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.040]   we could look it up on a map
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.360]   or we could look it up in the encyclopedia.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.320]   And my children did spend hours pouring over,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.040]   particularly the science encyclopedia
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.440]   because they loved learning about different creatures
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.480]   that God has made.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.000]   So that's where my library,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.520]   my homeschool library really started
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.120]   was with those key reference materials
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.560]   that I knew the children would use.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.520]   - Me too, Jennifer.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.800]   And you know what I did?
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.680]   This is funny.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.200]   I would go in those early years
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.600]   when my kids were curious about everything,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.160]   I would go to used book sales at libraries
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.200]   and buy even old textbooks,
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.800]   especially when my children weren't reading it.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.480]   So they could be really old textbooks
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.520]   that had great pictures that were our jumping off place
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.320]   or just really basic information that I could read
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.960]   and then water down for them to whatever level they were.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.800]   And so those used book sales at libraries
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.840]   are a treasure trove for homeschoolers.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.680]   - Yes.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.480]   And one thing I find often at used book sales
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.280]   are old collections.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.360]   I mean, I'm partial to the collections
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.280]   that I've helped to make,
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.160]   which are the Echoes books.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.000]   - Right.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.640]   - But I also have lots of other collections.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.040]   And so Harvard used to publish a series
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.760]   called the Junior Grade Books.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.520]   Then there was a series published in Chicago
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.720]   called My Book House
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.440]   that just are volumes and volumes of stories,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.680]   some fictional and some nonfiction
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.360]   that young people find fascinating.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.800]   And I collect those almost every time I stumble across one
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.560]   because they have such a great repository
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.280]   and they have aged very well for young children,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.120]   but that gives you lots of stories to choose from.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.800]   And in fact, I have a friend whose son is moving
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.360]   with her only grandbaby.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.280]   They are moving to Asia as missionaries
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.440]   and we're trying to figure out
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.800]   how to help them build a library.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.320]   And those kinds of collection books are very good for that
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.000]   'cause they can't take anything and everything
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.760]   with them as they go.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.600]   - Yes.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.240]   - We found a couple of great fairy tale anthologies
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.880]   and picture book anthologies 'cause he's little.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.920]   He's only one.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.680]   - Oh gosh.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.160]   - Trying to think of some collections of things
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.280]   that he could take.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.440]   So I think those collection type books
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.800]   are a good place to start when you're building your library
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.960]   because then you can get a lot of stories in one volume.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.680]   - Yes, that's really good.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.800]   And to realize that your library can grow
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.000]   as your children grow.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.120]   You don't have to have all the things at the beginning
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   in order to think that you have a library.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.760]   Your library can grow as your children grow
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.840]   and as their interests grow
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.320]   and as your interests grow
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   and as their abilities to read expand.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.160]   - Yeah.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.400]   - So that's a good thing.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.560]   - That's a good point that you made.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.600]   I add to my library all the time.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.320]   So last spring, Tim and I went
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.960]   to the Laura Ingalls Wilder farm in Missouri.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.240]   - Oh yeah.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.400]   - And I bought a hardback set of her books
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.160]   'cause my paperback books that I bought
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.040]   at the Scholastic Book Fair in 19--
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.440]   - Oh yes.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.280]   - Yeah.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.520]   - And I knew I couldn't loan those.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.600]   So I bought hardback copies of all her books
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.520]   that I could loan.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.960]   - That's good.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.280]   I was gonna ask you that.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.360]   That was one of the questions on my list.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.760]   Do you mostly have hardbacks
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.320]   or do you have, I know you must have,
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.080]   do you lend out paperback books too?
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.960]   - I do.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.360]   I lend both, but I really am trying,
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.520]   especially for the under 12 set
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.000]   to acquire hardbacks whenever I can.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   So that again, I don't want parents worrying.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.440]   I'm trying to get sturdy things
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.080]   that they feel comfortable letting their kids read,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.400]   lying outside on a picnic blanket
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.720]   or wherever they want to read them.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.080]   So I'm trying wherever I can
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.920]   to slowly replace all my paperbacks with hardbacks.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.760]   - That's good.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.000]   The durability is key.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.520]   - And you can find a lot of library discards in--
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.960]   - You really can.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.920]   Yes, you really can.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.600]   I have been blessed to do that.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.480]   A lot of my junior classics and junior fiction
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.040]   used to be library books.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.120]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   - So we don't have to go all in
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.840]   at the very beginning, our collection.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.880]   So if your children are preschoolers,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.520]   your library might be two or three low bookcases
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.720]   and maybe a bin of picture books.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.320]   And that would be a great way to start.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.840]   And like Jennifer said, a beginning reference section
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.280]   of a dictionary and history and science encyclopedias,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.080]   an atlas, and maybe an anthology or a book of books
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   that gives you suggestions of other things to do.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.760]   So here's another thing.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.280]   Who gets to contribute to your library?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.520]   Do you have books that your children wanted
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.440]   when they were little?
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.320]   Have you folded your kids' books into your library
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.560]   or is this mostly books that you choose
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.000]   for certain reasons?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   - So there were a few of my children's favorites
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.480]   that I have decided not to lend out
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.240]   because I want to be able to give them the seed
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.480]   for their library when they form their own families.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.200]   So I have kept back a few, you know, a couple of favorites
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.040]   of theirs, but I've also over the years
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.320]   helped them build their library.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.960]   So my daughters who are at college,
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.680]   I've been helping them buy some things
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.880]   that they want to read.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.320]   And so they have the seed of their own libraries
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.080]   going already.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.160]   So yeah, both things are happening.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.200]   - Yes, my girls have their bookcases in their bedrooms
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.960]   and they, from time to time, come back home
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.800]   'cause they're grown and gone.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.680]   They come back home and take an armful of their favorites.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.000]   Many of the picture books that they used as children
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.800]   are still here at my house.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.920]   And I hope to keep them at my house for grandchildren,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.720]   but I'm open to share.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.400]   And some of them, I will admit,
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.320]   I have multiple copies of some books.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.400]   - Yeah, because some of them, I let them take my grandson.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.480]   I've let have some of the books,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.840]   but then I promptly replaced them at home
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.560]   because I want to have things here.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   So what are your, go ahead.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.560]   - I was just gonna say, I'm in a little bit of a quandary
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.000]   because when I was recently in England
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   for our 30th anniversary, I bought three picture books.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.800]   They're utterly precious.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.320]   One of them is by Randolph Caldecott,
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.960]   who Caldecott Picture Book Awards are named after.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.400]   And I don't know,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.120]   I haven't quite worked my way up to loaning that one yet,
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.080]   but I feel like it does need to be read.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.320]   So I'm in a bit of a quandary about that one.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.440]   It's still sitting in my room.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.880]   And then I bought two books by a French children's author
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.040]   that was translated into English by a poet
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.680]   that I really like, a children's poet.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.040]   And so those three books are sitting there
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.880]   in the, I don't know quite yet
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   what I'm going to do with these.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.720]   - Right.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.880]   - They may not be loaned.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.840]   They may be read here.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.880]   - That's what I was gonna say.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.240]   You could have a reading room.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.080]   - Yes.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.760]   - That's perfect.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.760]   So do you have standards that you,
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.200]   I mean, I can remember, all right,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.520]   I'll just be really honest.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.280]   When my girls were little, I picked their library books
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.000]   because I knew what I wanted them to read.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.520]   I knew I wanted them to read good stuff.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.200]   And so I remember when my older daughter
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.920]   was in about the fifth grade and she said,
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.840]   "Why can't I pick my books?"
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.240]   And I said, "Well, I mean, what do you,
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.840]   "I want to be sure that you're reading good things.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.360]   "And I want, you know, I want it.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.640]   "I want you to be happy with your books.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.800]   "And what is it that you want to read?"
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.240]   And she, so she showed me this paperback book.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.240]   It was some Pony Club or something.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.640]   And I said, "Do you think that you will like that?"
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.000]   And she said, "Oh, I want to check this one out."
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.200]   And so I went on and picked some other ones for her,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.560]   but let her take that one home.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.440]   And we got home and she disappeared immediately to her room
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.120]   with that book she had chosen.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.720]   And she came down in about 20 minutes
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.920]   and she stuffed it back.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.400]   We had a big basket in our living room
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.920]   that all the library books were supposed to stay in
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.760]   because it was way too easy to get them mingled
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.000]   with our personal books
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.440]   and not be able to tell the difference.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.840]   So she came back and stuffed it
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.720]   in the back of the library basket.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.800]   And I said, "Are you done already?"
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.320]   Which was not beyond the pale of possibility.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.640]   And she said, "No."
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.120]   And I said, "What's the matter?"
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.960]   She said, "Well, you were right.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.760]   "It was not very well-written."
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.000]   And I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.920]   And she said, "Well, the characters are not very fleshed out
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.360]   "and the story is way too predictable."
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.120]   And so as a fifth grader,
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.840]   I was pretty glad that she was able to see that.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.280]   But that brings me to this question that I have for you.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.840]   What kind of standards?
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.480]   Do you have a little bit of everything in your library
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.720]   or do you really have what you consider to be the good stuff?
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.360]   - I mostly have the good stuff.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.880]   My mom was pretty careful about what we read growing up.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.160]   And so I have a lot of Louisa May Alcott
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.000]   and Laura Ingalls Wilder, and I gravitated
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.520]   toward those more historical books anyway.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.920]   But there are a few series, I will say,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.120]   there are points when it's good for kids to read fast.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.520]   So I have a few of those series
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.760]   that just help them get faster and faster at reading.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.800]   But even those are ones that I read with my kids
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   when they were younger and so comfortable having them.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.960]   Because I have limited resources to collect a library,
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   I don't see the point of collecting junk or fluff.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.360]   People can get that anywhere.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.440]   I'm trying to collect the really good things
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.720]   that might actually disappear if we don't all pay attention.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.280]   - Yes, excellent.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.840]   I love that philosophy.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.160]   I love that.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.160]   So as we homeschoolers who are dedicated
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.640]   to becoming keepers of the books
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.600]   and making sure that libraries continue,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.960]   how do we share our books?
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.560]   What suggestions do you have for us?
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.800]   - Well, one thing, if people don't have a resource
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.320]   to build a library or the time, right?
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.200]   I realize I'm in a time of life now where I am.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.040]   - Yes, but you can.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.200]   - I can, I'm no longer homeschooling
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.000]   all four little ones in front of me.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.760]   I could not have done this back then.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.000]   So back then what we did is share books
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.800]   with our friends and our CC community.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.200]   We did a lot of book swapping.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.800]   So we would take things to community
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.720]   and get things at community
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.000]   and then return them the next week.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.920]   And in the age where you can't depend
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.560]   on the main libraries anymore,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.320]   I still think it's a good way to go
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.680]   because we all have some number of books in our home
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.840]   and we can share them through our CC communities
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.880]   and through our church groups and through our neighborhoods.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.080]   So I think that's a fine way to start
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.560]   if you don't have the resources to build a gigantic library.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.320]   - That's good and that's very encouraging
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.240]   because a lot of us, that's where we are.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.880]   That's where we are.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.680]   So that's a good way to start small
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.800]   and to grow as you're able.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.000]   I love that.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.680]   All right.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   You have told us why it's important to keep the books.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.400]   How do you think we're doing now?
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   You mentioned that it kind of brought you up short
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.280]   when you noticed that people were saying
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.800]   there aren't as many libraries,
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.480]   there aren't as many books at the library,
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.320]   there aren't as many good books at the library
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.400]   and it made you want to buy all the books.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.800]   What's the status report?
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.760]   How are we doing now?
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.840]   - Well, it's interesting.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.400]   I think we might be doing slightly better.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.840]   Physical bookstores experienced a lot of growth
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.000]   in the years of COVID and after,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.680]   which is an interesting phenomenon, I think.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.800]   And usually when I go to my local bookstores,
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.600]   there are a lot of people in there browsing.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.520]   We like to touch books and flip through them
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.560]   before we buy them.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.720]   And I'm feeling better than I did two decades ago
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.320]   when the e-reader was pronouncing
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.840]   it was going to be the thing.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.400]   I think we've come around.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.480]   And in fact, I just read a charming essay
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.080]   called "On Browsing" and just the idea
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.800]   that we do like to touch things.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.880]   It always made me laugh too around the years around COVID
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.240]   that the other stores that were growing
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.840]   seemed to be candle shops.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.680]   - Yes, yes.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.600]   - Make you want to go and smell the candles.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.360]   You don't want to order candles online.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.760]   So there is some tactile experience
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.080]   that I think is in this generation
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.600]   making a bit of a comeback.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.680]   So I'm encouraged.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.080]   - I am too.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.600]   I think there are more bookstores
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.720]   and more people in the stores when we go in.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.360]   Our family is like yours.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.200]   A good rainy Saturday was we would all go
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.000]   to the bookstore and scatter.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And I was not above letting my voracious fast reader
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.240]   sit and read a book and then buy another one.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.080]   We always bought something,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.000]   but I was not above letting her read something
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.480]   because we lived 30 minutes from the bookstore.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.320]   I don't want you to be done with the book
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.360]   by the time we get home.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.200]   - Yes.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.760]   - That does not work for me on my fixed income.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   So we were go and browse a few hours
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   and everybody come home with something.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.960]   And some days we would say,
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.000]   everybody go and come home with something
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.800]   you never thought you would be interested in.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.320]   And that expanded our library greatly.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   Sometimes we got duds,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   but sometimes we got things that became favorites.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.000]   And so try it, you'll like it,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.360]   is a good way to think about it.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.200]   - Yes.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.520]   And a lot of our books that started
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   my sort of children's fiction section
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.920]   were ones that I did in book clubs.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   So all throughout homeschooling,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   I had book clubs for the children in our CC communities
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.360]   to do on a day outside of our CC day.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.840]   So I have a lot of book club books.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.680]   And then the other thing I forgot to share earlier
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.520]   is that you and I have a friend, Heather,
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.360]   who used to work for CC.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.600]   And Heather was always really good
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.560]   once she had resources to do it.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.760]   She would, if she found something,
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.320]   a Shakespeare play that she really liked,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.920]   she would buy five or eight copies of it.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.000]   And then whenever people came to her home
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.440]   and looked at her bookshelf,
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.800]   she would send them home with a book.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.480]   And so that's another thing
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.640]   that I'm trying to do whenever I can.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.840]   Some books stay in the library
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.040]   and some books I just let people take, so.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.800]   - Oh, what a blessing.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.680]   What a blessing.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.600]   And you know what?
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   Mom's, dad's just starting out homeschooling.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.720]   If you hear that and think, wow, but I can't do that.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.440]   I mean, I have little kids.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.880]   We're living on one income.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.400]   We don't have extra money.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.160]   That's something that you can grow toward.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.800]   It doesn't mean you're not a good friend
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.080]   or a good share if that's not where you are in life.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.920]   We all start small and we grow.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.960]   And that's what this whole podcast has been about,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.160]   building a family library.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.640]   And every library has to start somewhere.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   So start small, but with the idea
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.240]   that you are gonna build a family culture of learning
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.880]   as you collect your books and share your books
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.000]   and talk about your books with your family
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.200]   and in your community.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.520]   That's a great thing.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.400]   Jennifer, thank you so much for sharing about your library.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.360]   I know that we all wish we could go and see it,
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.600]   but at least you have inspired us
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.440]   to collect those things for ourselves.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.280]   Thank you.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.120]   - Yes, it's been fun.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.440]   I love talking about books.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.840]   - Parents, if you are thinking, man, that sounds so good.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.080]   I just want to learn more and more
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.600]   and I want to grow more and more
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.360]   and I want to be a better library collector,
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.440]   a better homeschooler, a better lead learner in my home.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.360]   I'm not really sure how to do that.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.240]   I've got a suggestion.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   What you might need is our classical learning cohort.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.400]   These classical learning cohorts help CC directors
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   and tutors and parent teachers grow in their confidence
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.480]   and in their competence
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.400]   with the classical tools of learning.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.480]   It will teach you to be
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.800]   a more confident classical educator.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.600]   If you're curious about that,
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.440]   about how it would work or how it would work for you,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.120]   you can register for a seat.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.600]   You can get information
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   at classicalconversations.com/cohort, okay?
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:07.280]   Classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.000]   It'll be awesome.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.040]   Thanks, you guys.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.120]   Go and build your libraries and read with your families
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.680]   and I'll see you next week.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.600]   Bye-bye.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.200]   (gentle music)
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.260]   you
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
