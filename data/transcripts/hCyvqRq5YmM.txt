[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.700]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.840]   My guest today is Dr. Chris Palmer.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.020]   Dr. Chris Palmer is a psychiatrist and researcher at Harvard University.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.500]   He focuses on how metabolic health, and mitochondrial health in particular,
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.220]   can be leveraged to treat, and in some cases cure, psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, depression, bipolar, and ADHD.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.400]   Today, we discuss how metabolic health, something we hear a lot about nowadays, is really about mitochondrial health
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.940]   and the specific lifestyle and other factors that you can use to improve mitochondrial number and function.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.120]   We talk about things like exercise, sleep, sunlight, which you've heard about before,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.380]   but we talk about those from a different perspective,
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.160]   and we discuss some things that have never been discussed before on this podcast,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.000]   at least in light of mitochondrial health, things such as creatine, methylene blue, nicotine,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.220]   and we talk about the key role of specific B vitamins and iron in brain function.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.500]   We also have a very direct discussion about vaccines and whether or not inflammation caused by vaccines
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.460]   can potentially damage mitochondria, which then leads to mental health challenges.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.640]   And of course, in that context, we discuss the vaccine autism debate.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.600]   We also discuss public health and what is needed to truly change the way people exercise and eat
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.540]   and the rapidly changing landscape of the National Institutes of Health and the CDC.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.600]   As you'll soon hear, Dr. Palmer gives us a master class on mitochondrial function
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080]   and how to improve this vital aspect of our health.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.340]   If you've heard about metabolic health, you've heard about the obesity crisis, that's important,
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.680]   but looking at all of that and approaching it through the lens of mitochondrial health,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.520]   you'll soon learn is absolutely the way to go.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.540]   It's a new perspective that will change the way that you think about mental and physical health
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.660]   and that no doubt will impact your health practices in very positive ways.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.340]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.700]   In keeping with that theme, this episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.140]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.120]   Dr. Chris Palmer, welcome back.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.020]   Thank you so much for having me back.
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.820]   I credit you with leading the call to arms, the public awareness, and the implementation of what some people call metabolic psychiatry,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.740]   but what we could easily just call the relationship between mental and physical health
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:45.420]   and the use of nutrition, supplementation, and where appropriate, prescription drugs for the treatment of mental health.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.020]   But what do you call this field that you've basically founded and that you're pioneering?
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.260]   There are others, right, but that you're pioneering.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.900]   And how should the general public think about the relationship between mitochondria and their mental health?
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.260]   For those that are not aware, educate us.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.540]   I could talk for hours on this.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.040]   So first of all, thank you for â€“ I think you're actually giving me way too much credit, though.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.800]   I don't know about that.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.660]   I'm talking a lot about it, and I think I will accept that maybe I'm able to talk about it in a way that helps people understand it,
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.180]   that other scientists haven't been able to.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.900]   But, you know, one of the more important reasons I want to say this is because, unbeknownst to a lot of people,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.940]   this field has actually been around for about a century and a half.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:50.940]   Researchers in the 1800s, around the turn of the century, well up into the 1960s, were hyper-focused on the role of metabolism in severe mental illness.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:03.020]   Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, they were actually measuring levels of lactate and glucose and other kind of metabolic biomarkers in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:14.220]   documenting differences, really kind of honing in on these metabolic disruptions is potentially the cause of mental illness.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.380]   And then our field lost its way.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.960]   We became focused on neurotransmitters and assumed that they were the primary cause of mental illness,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.780]   while other fields were focused on psychological and social factors.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.000]   You know, we got cognitive behavioral therapy, we still had psychodynamic psychotherapy,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.520]   but people were doing research on adverse childhood experiences.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.340]   That was really taking off, documenting that that's related.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:52.100]   And so, you know, the field kind of splintered into these biological, psychological, social camps.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.640]   And people really hyper-focused in all of these ways.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:06.740]   To me, this field of integrating metabolism with mental health, with physical health,
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.280]   is about unifying that whole story.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.080]   It's about unifying and building on what these researchers a hundred years ago were pursuing.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.660]   It's about integrating the biological, psychological, and social camps.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.300]   It's about putting it all together and stop being so reductionistic and simplistic
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.320]   to suggest that it's all biological or it's all psychological or it's all social,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.160]   and that if it's one, it can't be the other.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.400]   It can be all of them.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.600]   And it's different combinations for different people.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:54.100]   So, in many ways, I'm just standing on the shoulders of giants who have done groundbreaking work
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.700]   to create the science that allows us to put this all together.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:09.380]   With that said, I do firmly believe that we are on the cusp of a revolutionary change
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.540]   in the paradigm of the mental health field, of how we think about mental illness.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.120]   You know, there are myriad biological things.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.440]   The psychological and social things are all obvious and true.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.200]   Yes, stress, trauma, loneliness, adverse childhood experiences, all of those things come together.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.220]   Our field is long known that all of those things play a role in mental illness.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.640]   Exactly which mental illnesses?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.420]   It's essentially all of them.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:48.880]   Every one of the labels in DSM-5 can be impacted by biological, psychological, and social factors.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.920]   So, trauma and childhood increases risk for post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.740]   Duh.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.840]   Everybody knows that.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:04.320]   Trauma and childhood also increases risk for neurodevelopmental disorders if it occurs early enough.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.440]   It increases risk for substance use disorders, personality disorders, psychotic disorders,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.860]   mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia later in life, and everything else.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.380]   Every label.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.000]   What else do adverse childhood experiences increase risk for?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.560]   All of the metabolic disorders.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.420]   Obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, premature mortality.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:39.140]   You know, we have statistics that, just sticking with that theme, adverse childhood experiences.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:47.640]   If you have six or more adverse childhood experiences, compared to somebody who has no adverse childhood experiences,
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.060]   Now, that's a rare group, granted.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:57.180]   But for the people who have six or more, on average, they live 20 years shorter.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:04.080]   They lose 20 years of life because of those adverse childhood experiences.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.500]   And so, is that a mental health issue?
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.780]   I would say it's a physical health issue.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.540]   It's both.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.360]   It's both a mental health issue and a physical health issue.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.820]   And so, how can we understand that?
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:30.340]   How can we understand that trauma in childhood increases risk for heart disease, and obesity, and diabetes, and dementia, and PTSD, and ADHD, and ADHD, and substance use disorders,
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:37.840]   And the only way to connect it is through metabolism, and ultimately through mitochondria.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.140]   Unfortunately, people like simple answers, and they're like, so diet will fix everything.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.260]   I'm like, no, I never said diet will fix everything.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.300]   But it can help.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.740]   And it can be life-changing and life-saving.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:59.440]   I don't want to minimize or step back from my work with dietary interventions.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.320]   There is no doubt in my mind it can dramatically change people's lives.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   But it's not just diet.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.900]   It's lots of other things.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:21.180]   And so, it's putting it together and trying to make sense of the science for what does cardiovascular disease have to do with depression or PTSD.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.320]   On the surface, a lot of people scratch their heads, and they really don't know.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.200]   They assume that, well, one's a brain disorder and one's a heart disorder.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:45.720]   And it's like, no, we need to integrate that because all of the risk factors, essentially the same biopsychosocial risk factors that increase risk for heart disease also increase risk for brain disease.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.760]   And we need to start putting it together.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.100]   We need to be more sophisticated.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.380]   We have computers.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.060]   We have AI.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.780]   It's 2025.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.840]   We can do better.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:05.640]   Yes, well, first of all, I, and I'm sure the listeners, really appreciate your humility regarding who's responsible for the big surge in the interest in this field.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.300]   So, thanks for crediting your predecessors and the others in the field.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:24.100]   At the same time, I credit you with really popularizing a lot of these terms, being willing to go public-facing and share about metabolic psychiatry, for lack of a better way to put it, metabolic psychiatry.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:33.980]   And really championing these ideas and being open to being part of a medical and science and public discourse community.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.840]   So, I'd be remiss if I didn't say that.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.060]   So, hopefully you'll take that in.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.400]   And if you won't, then-
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.960]   I very much appreciate it.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.860]   Well, it's true.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.040]   It's true.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.820]   And I'm not alone in that sentiment.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.480]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, Our Place.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.720]   Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:03.240]   Surprisingly, toxic compounds such as PFASs, or forever chemicals, are still found in 80% of nonstick pans, as well as utensils, appliances, and countless other kitchen products.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:15.740]   As I've discussed on this podcast, these PFASs, or forever chemicals, like Teflon, have been linked to major health issues such as hormone disruption, gut microbiome disruption, fertility issues, and many other health concerns.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.820]   So, it's really important to avoid them.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.400]   This is why I'm a huge fan of Our Place.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.760]   Our Place products are made with the highest quality materials and are all PFAS and toxin-free.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.080]   I particularly love their Titanium Always Pan Pro.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.820]   It's the first nonstick pan made with zero chemicals and zero coating.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.920]   Instead, it's pure titanium.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:41.300]   This means it has no harmful forever chemicals and that it doesn't degrade or lose its nonstick effect over time.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.160]   It's also beautiful to look at.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.140]   I cook eggs in my Titanium Always Pan Pro almost every morning.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.140]   The design allows for the eggs to cook perfectly and without sticking to the pan.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.820]   I also cook burgers and steaks in it, and it puts a really nice sear on the meat.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.240]   But again, nothing sticks to it, so it's really easy to clean and even dishwasher safe.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.140]   I love it, and I use it constantly.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:07.900]   Our Place now has a full line of Titanium Pro cookware that uses this first-of-its-kind titanium nonstick technology.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:17.000]   So if you're looking for non-toxic, long-lasting pots and pans, go to fromourplace.com slash Huberman and use the code Huberman for 10% off your order.

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.700]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:41.140]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.340]   Proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.600]   Even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.300]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.420]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body,
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.760]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.020]   Drinking Element dissolved in water makes it extremely easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.200]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.960]   I dissolve one packet of Element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.300]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.500]   I also drink Element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.520]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.000]   They have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of Element.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.400]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.740]   Frankly, I love them all.
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:38.960]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement.com slash Huberman to claim a free Element sample pack with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.720]   Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman to claim a free sample pack.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:52.580]   If I think about a mental health condition like depression, let's take depression to start off.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:14:01.900]   I can just broadly create two, you know, columns of things or approaches that one might take.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.460]   One is this mental model of sort of a molecule deficiency.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:14.680]   Like, I'm not saying this, but there are many who at one point thought depression is related to a deficiency in serotonin,
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:21.720]   or depression is related to a deficiency in dopamine, either levels, regulation, enzymatic control,
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.060]   whatever the level of control.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:31.520]   Just this idea that these molecules are somehow lacking, if you put them back, you can relieve some symptoms of depression.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:41.900]   The other column that comes to mind for me, having looked at the data on cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:50.700]   on the data on psychedelics in the clinical setting for the treatment of depression, SSRIs, and other so-called antidepressants,
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.400]   is this notion of neuroplasticity, the idea that neural circuits can change,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   and that neural circuits control our sense of well-being, our perception of self, perception of others, feelings of agency, et cetera.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.520]   And it's now very clear that if you change levels of neuromodulators, like dopamine, like serotonin,
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:15.100]   you don't necessarily cure depression, but you open a window for plasticity,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.680]   and then perhaps the therapy that you're doing can modify brain circuits more robustly.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.340]   So I think in terms of molecule deficiency, maybe it's a vitamin deficiency, a neuromodulator deficiency,
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.720]   and then I also think about plasticity, that these treatments are just allowing for more brain change,
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.400]   more rapidly.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.040]   What other columns would you add to that picture?
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:43.440]   And perhaps first, do you think that picture is woefully inadequate or just partially inadequate?
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.920]   Because I think this is the way most people think about the treatment of mental health.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.100]   They think, oh, there's something missing.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.400]   You take a drug and you get that thing back.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.920]   And then like ADHD, you don't have enough dopamine or you put it in,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.940]   and then all of a sudden attentional circuits work better.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.820]   This kind of thing versus plasticity, which is the modification of those circuits.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:08.920]   And the two things are not mutually exclusive, but I think until now there really hasn't been a clear understanding
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.240]   that there are other columns for mechanistic change in mental health.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   I would say the concept of metabolism, metabolic regulation, mitochondrial function, mitochondrial health,
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.160]   actually is an umbrella concept for everything you've just said.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.700]   It's an umbrella concept for, well, how do we create neurotransmitters?
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.640]   Where do these neurotransmitters come from?
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.020]   What regulates their production, release from cells?
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:51.600]   And then even to go further, what impact do those neurotransmitters have on other cells?
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.520]   They are largely regulating brain metabolism.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.580]   And the way we usually think about it is they are regulating brain activity.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.760]   But if you ask the question, well, what is brain activity?
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.940]   Brain activity is either, it's fueled by metabolism.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:21.640]   A neuron cannot be active unless it has the capacity to increase its ATP kind of production.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:30.540]   And then when you suppress a neuron, when you inhibit its function, the ATP production goes down.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.840]   So whether you want to think of metabolism as just a consequence of neural activity,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.300]   I actually think about it as an integral part of neural activity.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.260]   It's kind of like your car can't go without the engine.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.940]   A cell can't go without mitochondria.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.700]   A cell can't do what it's supposed to do without mitochondria.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.680]   The other concept that you mentioned, neuroplasticity.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:18:02.580]   Neuroplasticity is all about energy and metabolic resources to create new connections.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:17.580]   New neural connections between axons, dendrites, somas, other aspects of neurons and cells and other types of cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:27.880]   But in order to get neuroplasticity, neuroplasticity implies growth and modulation and even pruning.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.860]   But it involves change.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:38.880]   And in order for a living organism to change, that requires this foundational concept of metabolism.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.160]   Now, on the surface, to a lot of people, that sounds too abstract.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.300]   And it sounds like, well, that's ridiculous then.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.080]   If you're saying that metabolism is everything in biology.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.960]   And I kind of am.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.760]   Of course it is.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.340]   You can't talk about biology without talking about metabolism.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:10.700]   But when you talk about metabolic health, it becomes much more concrete, pragmatic, and real with real tools that you talk about all of the time on this podcast.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.840]   Exercise promotes metabolic health.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.680]   Exercise promotes neuroplasticity.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.800]   They are inseparable.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:31.680]   You can't improve your metabolic health without also at least opening up the opportunity for neuroplasticity.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.880]   Improving your diet does the same thing.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.500]   Sleep or lack thereof can impact this.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.480]   Substance use can impact this.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.960]   And so, you know, in a way, it basically says, let's connect all of the dots.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:57.840]   Let's not hyper-focus on serotonin and a serotonin imbalance or deficiency as the singular cause of depression.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.260]   Because for those of you who don't know, that is ridiculously reductionistic.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.720]   And it is absolutely not true.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.220]   We know that.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.980]   We know that with certainty now.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:25.000]   You know, the whole serotonin hypothesis of depression came about not because researchers identified serotonin deficits in the brain.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:40.340]   That entire concept came from the observation that medications that modulate serotonin activity or inhibit its reuptake into neurons,
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:51.200]   those medications, SSRIs, other types of antidepressants, those medications can reduce the symptoms of depression in some people.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:58.160]   That was just a purely serendipitous finding.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.440]   It was serendipity.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.800]   The first antidepressant was actually a tuberculosis treatment.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.900]   They were giving it to patients on a tuberculosis ward.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:18.980]   And an astute infectious disease doctor noticed some of these patients are really depressed.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:24.860]   But when I give them this tuberculosis treatment, they perk up.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.580]   Within a few weeks, they start looking a lot less depressed.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.840]   And I don't think it's a coincidence.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.600]   I think it's the medication I'm giving them.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.960]   Do you recall what the drug was?
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.200]   It's the first MAO inhibitor.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.740]   And I could be saying the name wrong, but it's the first MAO inhibitor.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.380]   And that became the first antidepressant.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.460]   Which makes sense.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.420]   MAO inhibitors inhibit the enzymes that break down.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.400]   Or let's just speak about these enzymes broadly.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:11.200]   I think most antidepressant drugs or treatments for ADHD, typical prescription treatments, either reduce the breakdown of neuromodulators like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, depending on which one we're talking about.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.740]   Or they reduce the reuptake so that there's just more neuromodulator around for longer.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.500]   Tell us about mitochondria in the framework of mental health.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.780]   So most people know mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell, if they know it at all.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.120]   So these tiny little organelles.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:41.520]   And the powerhouse of the cell reference means that mitochondria take the breakdown products of the food that we're eating.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.920]   They are the primary thing using the oxygen that we're breathing in.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.600]   They are creating the carbon dioxide that we're breathing out.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.940]   And that they are turning food into ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.960]   So they're taking food and oxygen and lots of other things.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.320]   But let's just simplify.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.200]   Food and oxygen, converting it into ATP.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.320]   And that is what the powerhouse of the cell kind of refers to.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.700]   There is no doubt they do that.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:20.900]   There is no doubt that when that process stops, humans have about six minutes or so, and then we're dead.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.660]   That process is critical to life.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.520]   There is no other process in the human body that you can disrupt that will kill the organism faster.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.980]   It is central to living organisms, this production of ATP.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:44.460]   So I don't at all mean to take away or minimize that function.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:52.880]   But research over the last 25 years has completely upended that simplistic notion of what mitochondria are doing.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.860]   They are actually doing so much more.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.780]   Some people have created the reference that mitochondria are like the workers inside a cell.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:05.260]   That in order for a cell to work, you need a workforce.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.000]   Because there's so much that needs to be done.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.200]   Signals need to be sent.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.740]   Like all this work, all of these different things need to be functioning.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:21.360]   And mitochondria are absolutely providing the energy for those things to happen.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.020]   But they're also orchestrating a lot of it.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:33.500]   So for example, they play a direct role in converting food into some of the substrates for the production of neurotransmitters.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:48.180]   And that plays a role in GABA in GABA's release from a neuron.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:59.420]   They actually go to the cell membrane and move along the membrane, dispensing vesicles of neurotransmitters.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:11.840]   And when you take the mitochondria away from the synapse, but provide that synapse with ATP, vesicles don't get released.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.500]   Those neurotransmitters aren't getting released.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.500]   The mitochondria are doing more.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.580]   We don't exactly know what.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.720]   But they're doing more than just providing the energy.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:30.140]   They play a role in turning inflammation and immune cells both on and off.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:48.820]   They play an instrumental role in both the first and the last step in the synthesis of cortisol.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:57.960]   And they play a role in the first step in the synthesis of all of the steroid hormones, which include estrogen, testosterone, progesterone.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:21.040]   So that if you have dysregulation of testosterone or estrogen or progesterone, you must understand the role of mitochondria in that dysregulation because they are critical in the production and release of these hormones.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.460]   They are the primary regulator of epigenetics.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.700]   So epigenetics are the expression of genes from the cell nucleus.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.140]   And researchers have long known that that's related to levels of reactive oxygen species.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.200]   It's related to levels of calcium.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.520]   It's related to other cell signals.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.880]   Those cell signals are mostly originating within mitochondria during the development of any cell.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.180]   Mitochondria, they are like a universe unto themselves.
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.020]   And there's so much we don't know about them.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:08.140]   But what researchers have found is that mitochondria actually line up, literally line up in an organized fashion around the cell nucleus and take on different conformations.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:22.080]   And that is somehow sending signals to the genes to result in the expression or the suppression of different genes from the nucleus.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:29.480]   And that when researchers take these mitochondria and like mess them up or something, the cell doesn't develop normally.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:37.160]   You know, they've been implicated in all of the phases of the human stress response to psychological stress.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.580]   So that includes cortisol release, noradrenaline release.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.800]   It includes inflammation.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.000]   And it includes epigenetic changes.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.320]   So those are kind of the four buckets of the human stress response.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:59.580]   Cortisol, adrenaline, inflammation, and epigenetic changes.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:12.320]   And researchers actually manipulated mitochondrial genes, two genes in the cell nucleus that control for mitochondrial proteins and two genes in mitochondria themselves.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:25.300]   And by manipulating these four different genes, one at a time in mice, they could impact all of the four aspects of the stress response.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:33.740]   And so what that means is that mitochondria are somehow involved in regulating the human stress response.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:43.140]   And so the way that I think about it is that, and the way that many researchers actually think about it now,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:53.020]   is that mitochondria, you know, there are hundreds, sometimes thousands of them in our cells, in each of our cells.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.640]   Most neurons have thousands of mitochondria.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.020]   The mitochondria are actually moving around.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.620]   They use the cytoskeleton to move around the cell.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.220]   They fuse with each other.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.260]   It's called mitochondrial dynamics.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.360]   They, like, change shape.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.880]   They do all sorts of things.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.980]   And again, that impacts all of these signaling processes.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.900]   But that's just within one little cell.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:25.220]   So you can think of one cell as, like, almost a village of mitochondria.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:31.180]   That they're all just doing different things and working together to help that cell function.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.380]   But in fact, when you think about hormones like cortisol,
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:41.240]   you can think about it as a way for mitochondria in one cell to produce cortisol,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:47.340]   that they can get sent to mitochondria in another cell to make that other cell do something,
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.880]   to either increase its activity or decrease its activity.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:58.440]   Some people actually think about human cells as just a network of mitochondria.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:07.480]   All kind of mitochondria throughout the body and brain are just doing all sorts of things.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.040]   And at the end of the day, we come back to just common sense.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.020]   At the end of the day, it's about helping the organism adapt and survive.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:22.560]   Ultimately, organisms, rule number one, they need to survive.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.960]   Rule number two, they need to reproduce.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.080]   And rule number three, they need to adapt.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:39.900]   And mitochondria are playing a foundational role in all of those basic aspects of organismal survival.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.060]   And again, to some people, well, that's so high level.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.360]   That's like what you're saying.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.920]   It's everything.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.840]   I'm like, yeah, it kind of is.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.320]   And mental health falls under it.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.200]   How could we think about mental health without thinking about the big picture?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.480]   Let's start with the big picture, and then let's put health into it.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:08.700]   And let's put the lack of adaptation, or the lack of survival, or these other things.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.600]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.080]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink with adaptogens.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.160]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.020]   The reason I started taking AG1, and the reason I still take AG1,
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.940]   is because it is the highest quality and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.400]   What that means is that AG1 ensures that you're getting all the necessary vitamins,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.760]   minerals, and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation for your daily health.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.740]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.460]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms that line your digestive tract
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.060]   and impact things such as your immune system status, your metabolic health,
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.980]   your hormone health, and much more.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.520]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily, my digestion is improved,
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.600]   my immune system is more robust, and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.820]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement, that supplement would be AG1.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:13.000]   If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer.

[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.960]   Today's episode is also brought to us by 8Sleep.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.340]   8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:37.620]   Now, I've spoken before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each and every night.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:43.380]   Now, one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to ensure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:49.800]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop about one to three degrees.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:56.260]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.620]   8Sleep automatically regulates the temperature of your bed throughout the night according to your unique needs.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:10.260]   Now, I find that extremely useful because I like to make the bed really cool at the beginning of the night, even colder in the middle of the night, and warm as I wake up.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.600]   That's what gives me the most slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.920]   And I know that because 8Sleep has a great sleep tracker that tells me how well I've slept and the types of sleep that I'm getting throughout the night.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:26.700]   I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover for four years now, and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:35.640]   Their latest model, the Pod 4 Ultra, also has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees in order to improve your airflow and stop you from snoring.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   If you decide to try 8Sleep, you have 30 days to try it at home, and you can return it if you don't like it.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.120]   No questions asked, but I'm sure that you'll love it.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.420]   Go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman to save up to $350 off your Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.940]   8Sleep ships to many countries worldwide, including Mexico and the UAE.

[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:07.700]   What are some of the things that we know can improve mitochondrial health, either number, function, or otherwise?
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:13.160]   And maybe we can talk about the basics first and get a little bit granular, if you could, about, you know,
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:18.800]   what are the prescriptions for keeping your mitochondria healthy or improving your mitochondrial number and improving their function?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:28.160]   And then we can transition from there to the more, let's just say, the more advanced ways of doing that.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.820]   Is there a role for supplementation?
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.440]   Is there a role for drugs?
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:38.340]   Is there, you know, these days where I hear about urolithin A, because I'm a little bit of an adventurer these days,
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:44.160]   and I'm turning 50 later this year, I decided to experiment with a peptide that is SR31,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.880]   which is specifically to improve mitochondrial function.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.120]   And I'm doing this with the full understanding.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.580]   It may do nothing or it may kill me.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.080]   I don't know.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.500]   But we'll find out.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.420]   But someone had to do it.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.660]   And I'm a one variable at a time kind of guy.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:04.960]   So it was important for me to stay with my current regimen and only change that, do blood work, et cetera,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.620]   because a lot of people, some people out there are more in the mode of trying to do a bunch of things.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.740]   And I don't think that's as helpful to me.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.760]   It's also just not.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.660]   It's not in keeping with my nature.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:15.860]   You're a scientist.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.280]   I'm a scientist.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.340]   One variable at a time.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   You're a scientist.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.000]   That is great.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.240]   That's right.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.180]   I'm monogamous with respect to variables.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:20.760]   Right.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:27.380]   So what can we do at a basic level to keep and improve our mitochondrial number and function?
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.600]   And if we have to hit on some of the usual suspects, fine.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.200]   But if you could tell us how we can do this.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:41.700]   So I'm really going to start with the basics and they're going to sound cliche and they're going to sound too basic to most people.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.760]   And I just want to set the stage for even for severe mental illness.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.500]   We can talk about strategies that will work.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.520]   And these strategies that I'm going to describe are not really appropriate.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.500]   Like when somebody becomes severely ill, these strategies may not be sufficient.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.200]   But the basics are what we call the field of lifestyle medicine.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.660]   So there are six pillars of lifestyle medicine.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:28.760]   They include diet, nutrition, exercise or movement, sleep, managing substance use, ideally reducing it or minimizing it or eliminating it, stress reduction practices, mindfulness, meditation, yoga.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.140]   And the last one is relationships.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:46.240]   I throw in the word purpose into relationships because I think even if you don't have a lot of friends or family, you can still have a very full thriving life if you have a purpose.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.520]   So those are the six pillars.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:57.620]   Unfortunately, this is where the cliches and the worthless advice begin, especially in the diet nutrition camp.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:02.700]   Because people will say, eat more plants, eat some broccoli, have some good blueberries.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.180]   Blueberries have antioxidants.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:11.020]   Have some blueberries on whatever else you're eating and everything will be fine.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:16.840]   If you just add a couple of servings of blueberries a week, you'll improve your health.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.740]   Brain food.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.540]   And it is such worthless advice.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.480]   It is not at all that simple.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:29.300]   And so I think diet nutrition gets complicated fast.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.000]   The other things are actually pretty straightforward.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.540]   Should you move your body?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.040]   Yes.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:44.680]   Should you stress your body intermittently, allowing for full recovery?
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:45.680]   Yes.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.480]   That's what most people call exercise.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.320]   And what are you doing when you exercise?
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:58.380]   You're actually, if we look at like the muscles, for example, muscle tissue, what exactly does exercise do?
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:15.280]   Whether it's isometric exercise to increase the size of the muscle, or whether it's endurance capacity, which actually does not change the size of the muscle at all, but allows for somebody to run longer, faster, harder.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.020]   So marathon runners, for example, can be quite thin.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.000]   You can look at a marathon runner and think you're not even an athlete.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.840]   They don't look all that different, yet they can run sometimes a hundred miles.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.440]   And what makes their muscles different than my muscles?
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.640]   Because I can't run a hundred miles.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.100]   Me either.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.860]   What makes their muscles different than mine?
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:44.260]   Even if the size isn't different, there is one and only one thing that makes their muscles different, and it's called mitochondria.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.960]   The number?
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.020]   The number of mitochondria, and almost certainly the health of mitochondria.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:57.020]   You can actually take a biopsy of their muscle, and you will see a much higher density of mitochondria in their muscle tissue than you will in mine.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:08.660]   If you actually then did a more thorough assessment of ATP capacity, their muscles or their mitochondria would be much healthier than mine.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:15.040]   Their mitochondria would have greater capacity for ATP production than my mitochondria would.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.760]   So that's exercise.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.260]   There are lots of things you can do with exercise.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.640]   For people who don't exercise at all, yes, get out and just walk.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.800]   Just do something.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.060]   Maybe get some sunlight in the morning while you're at it.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.360]   That sounds like a good idea.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:35.960]   The substance use is obvious.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.520]   It's the thing.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.640]   You've been talking about it.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.620]   I've been talking about it.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.520]   Which substances deplete mitochondria?
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.880]   I've been very interested in this.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:54.020]   I'm a big lover of certain genres of music, and whenever the topic of music comes up, the name Rick Rubin comes up because he's been on this podcast twice.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.280]   He's the famous Rick Rubin, amazing producer, and I'm blessed to have him as a close friend.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:04.300]   And I often ask Rick, I'm like, why are so many of these folks in music dead?
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:10.440]   There seems to be a history of people who did stimulants.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   It took a lot of stimulants, cocaine and amphetamine in particular.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:26.980]   Musicians that did that in the 70s and 80s and 90s seemed to drop dead of heart attacks later when they were not currently using, as far as we know, those stimulants.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:34.500]   Is it the case that stimulants like cocaine and amphetamine deplete cells of mitochondria?
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.240]   Do we know that to be true?
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.340]   We do know, and it's a slightly more complex story.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.060]   So it's all about the dose.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.180]   So stimulants are used to treat ADHD.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:41:00.240]   And we know that people, we've known for decades, people who have ADHD, who have symptoms of ADHD, have glucose hypometabolism in their brains.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:06.740]   So their brains are not producing enough ATP from glucose.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.600]   What is one way to increase that?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.820]   Dopamine.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:26.320]   Dopamine will increase that so you can give people stimulants to improve their brain metabolism enough so that they now no longer have symptoms or at least have a reduction in their symptoms.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.360]   That story is unequivocally true.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:47.420]   We have lots of animal data, human neuroimaging data, clinical research studies documenting that appropriate doses of stimulants, so that's usually low-ish doses, can improve brain metabolism.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.520]   And what that means is that they're actually stimulating mitochondria to produce more ATP.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.860]   However, metabolism is all about balance.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.760]   You can underdo it, you can underdo it, and you can overdo it.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:20.720]   And when you overdo it, what happens is that if you hyper-stimulate mitochondria with high doses of stimulants, the mitochondria are essentially running on all cylinders, and electrons start leaking out of the electron transport chain.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:31.500]   And what happens is then damage the mitochondria with high doses of stimulants, and it can lead to chronic mitochondria, chronic metabolic dysfunction, which then damage the mitochondria themselves and damage other aspects of the cell.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:38.940]   And it can lead to chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic metabolic dysfunction.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.280]   It's challenging with stimulants.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.700]   Because people are looking for a yes or no answer.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.180]   So, Dr. Palmer, do you think stimulants are good or bad?
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.720]   I don't have an answer to that.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.300]   It depends on the person.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.180]   It depends on the dose of stimulants.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.900]   It depends on the type of stimulant.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.180]   It depends on what impact it's having on that person.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:07.780]   But we need to open our minds to the possibility that, yes, maybe some people do benefit from stimulants.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:14.880]   And maybe, at the same time, other people are harmed in catastrophic ways by stimulants.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:20.820]   And it can all be linked through mitochondrial mechanisms.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.660]   It can certainly be linked through dopamine.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:28.140]   But, again, we have to ask, well, what is that dopamine doing to the target cells?
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:41.280]   That when dopamine gets released and connects with a dopamine receptor, what happens to that target cell, it changes the metabolism of that target cell.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.260]   It increases the activity of that target cell.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.200]   So, stimulants are one.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.720]   Back to this bigger kind of lifestyle medicine picture.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.500]   Stimulants are definitely one.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.400]   High-dose stimulants, very harmful to human health.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.960]   What are some others?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.560]   Alcohol.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.160]   We've known since the 1960s.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:06.340]   In the 1960s, researchers were trying to figure out, how the hell does alcohol cause cirrhosis?
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.960]   We knew that.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.880]   We've known that.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.800]   We've known that for a long time.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.780]   Alcoholics develop liver failure.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.820]   They develop cirrhosis of the liver, and they can die from it.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.440]   How exactly does that happen?
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.440]   In the 1960s, researchers figured out it's mitochondrial toxicity.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.300]   Interesting.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.660]   In the liver cells.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.000]   That is what's making the liver cells die.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:43.740]   That alcohol gets converted into this molecule called acetaldehyde, which is very toxic to lots of cell parts, but in particular to mitochondria.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:54.480]   Mitochondria are processing this alcohol and other enzymes and kind of other things are trying to detoxify the alcohol.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:00.740]   But at the end of the day, mitochondrial toxicity seems to be a clear route.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:15.060]   When I was doing research on mitochondria for the book, there were over 10,000 published research articles of alcohol and mitochondria.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:20.440]   And I was initially shocked by that, and I wondered, like, what's that about?
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:30.340]   Like, that's how I know this 1960s story and everything else is because researchers have been looking at how is it that alcohol can be so toxic?
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:40.640]   And the two organs that are most effective are the liver, because that's the primary organ trying to detoxify it, and then the brain.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.200]   And why the brain?
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.080]   Because the brain is highly sensitive to metabolic disruption.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:53.740]   Other substances of abuse, tobacco, the carcinogens in tobacco.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.840]   So not nicotine per se.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.160]   Do we know if nicotine is depleting mitochondria?
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.140]   Nicotine is a stimulant for mitochondria.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.960]   So again, similar story.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.760]   Low doses can be great.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.340]   High doses may, in fact, be toxic.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:09.920]   Oh, good.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.800]   You've got to get â€“ you've got to find the right balance.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:21.740]   I'm not a big nicotine guy, but lately I've started chewing half of a piece of nicotine gum a few times a week.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.840]   So two milligrams to four milligrams, which is very low dose.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.280]   A couple of â€“ I would say maybe three, four days a week I'll do that.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.500]   And I'm doing it specifically for brain health reasons.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:40.880]   And I have no relationship to any nicotine pouch or gum or anything like that, so I want to be really, like, company.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.920]   So I'm doing a little experiment.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.360]   And, you know, it's an interesting stimulant because it relaxes you a little bit too.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.320]   But I wouldn't want kids to start doing this or people in their 20s or 30s.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.900]   Like I said, I'm approaching the fifth floor.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.100]   I'm going to be 50 in September.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.880]   And I want to do everything I can to hold on to the neurons I've got.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:06.900]   So I think low-level stimulation of perhaps the mitochondria and other â€“ certainly the acetylcholine system with nicotine is a good idea.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:15.120]   But what I see is a lot of people who are taking these pouches that range from anywhere from three milligrams on the low-end dose side all the way up to eight milligrams.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.940]   And it is very habit-forming.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.680]   People start with one pouch or two pouches a day, and pretty soon they're doing a canister every day or two.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.940]   So even the cost, it starts to be a big deal.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.260]   But it's pretty incredible.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.180]   It was on the Berkeley campus, and I went to a little convenience store near the Berkeley campus recently.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.920]   This kid came in, and we started chatting.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.460]   He was a podcast fan.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.140]   We were chatting, and he was there to buy nicotine pouches.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.760]   I said, how many of those do you go through a week?
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.920]   And he's like, seven or eight.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.020]   I was like, really?
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.680]   He was an engineering student.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:51.640]   But in my years in college, it was always just, you know, some coffee or something.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.860]   Yeah, some coffee.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.780]   We didn't really have.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.740]   I'd stick with coffee.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.860]   For the young folks, yeah.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.600]   For the young folks?
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:57.880]   For the young.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.380]   A little bit of coffee.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.280]   And again, it's about dose.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:01.520]   Yep.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.160]   And it's about look.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:13.260]   So most things that enhance metabolism quickly can be addictive.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:23.660]   And I think that's the challenge for a lot of people, is that you get that energy right away.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:32.220]   At some point, you acclimate to that substance somewhat, and then you want more.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.900]   You want that same increase that you got before.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:49.420]   So it's just important to kind of be mindful that you can overstimulate metabolism mitochondrial function.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.100]   And then you start depleting mitochondria.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.100]   And then, yeah.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.760]   And then you actually, the mitochondria begin producing more reactive oxygen species, which
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.820]   ends up being detrimental.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.220]   So it's like driving your car.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:08.660]   Again, if you think about mitochondria like an engine, it's like an engine of your car.
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:15.520]   When you're driving your car on the highway, you don't want to go too slow, and you don't
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.700]   want to go too fast.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.180]   You need to have balance.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.160]   And acceleration is costly.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.060]   And acceleration is costly, right?
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.920]   I mean, transmission systems, you know, create this incredible efficiency of being able to
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.780]   travel at speed with more efficiency, you know, but accelerating is a different thing altogether.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.260]   I mean, that's the way that I think about it.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.960]   And so somebody who's addicted to drugs and alcohol, for example, they're on a roller coaster
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:46.800]   ride of hyper-stimulating their metabolic rate and then trying to suppress that hyper-stimulation
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.280]   with sedatives so that they can sleep or calm down.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.160]   And then they're just, but they're destroying their metabolic health.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.640]   And does that really play out?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.120]   Like, and is that, you know, some will say, well, Chris, that's just one of myriad things
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.780]   that they're doing to their cells.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:05.360]   Sure.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.980]   But does it play out in diseases that we think of as metabolic diseases?
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.780]   Absolutely.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.200]   Type 2 diabetes?
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:15.860]   Yes.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.480]   Cardiovascular disease?
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.340]   A hundred percent.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.180]   Like premature mortality?
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:27.980]   Um, like it, there's, it's kind of like the elephant in the room that we have just failed
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:34.240]   to look at because we've been so splintered with, no, it's biological.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.200]   No, it's psychological.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.040]   No, it's social.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.200]   It's like, it's all of them.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.120]   Let's look at the elephant that comprises all of them.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:44.400]   One of the beautiful things about science is that you isolate variables.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.680]   You can get very reductionist.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.100]   We know that there are these things called mitochondria that they move around.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.460]   I mean, these discoveries are truly incredible that have been made in the last hundred years
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:53.880]   or so.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:51:00.920]   But there's been this, um, kind of obsession, I, I think in, in the public discussion around
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:07.800]   health that, you know, around things that are obviously related to the thing that you're
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.280]   trying to cure.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.920]   So serotonin and brain health, it's like, oh, okay, it makes sense.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.940]   You know, the listening to Prozac book came out, we increased serotonin, some people are
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.500]   feeling better.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.760]   Maybe it's through neuroplasticity, maybe it's direct effects of serotonin and, but it makes
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.060]   sense.
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.480]   Serotonin brain, right?
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:30.760]   You know, um, but if we zoom out from that and we accept because it's true that essentially
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.700]   all cells are dependent on mitochondria for their function, why wouldn't we go to this
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:41.380]   fundamental layer, uh, first in order to try and improve mental and physical health simultaneously,
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.320]   right?
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.700]   It's a very different way of approaching medicine in general.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.880]   Normally we go, okay, well, the issue is right here.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.020]   That's where the tumor is.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.820]   That's where the circuit deficit is.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.260]   This is where the, the lesion is, uh, or the growth.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.180]   And we're going to go there, right?
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.620]   But, um, to avoid that, the pathologic state in the first place, uh, these six pillars are
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:07.540]   wonderful, by the way, a diet, exercise, sleep, substance, overuse or abuse, stress mitigation
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.620]   and relationship slash purpose.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:16.160]   Um, so we're going to keep returning to this theme of, of mitochondria is foundational, um,
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.440]   throughout today's discussion, because I think people need to, to frame their health
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.240]   in that context.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   I really do also, um, years ago, my postdoc advisor, the late Ben Barris, he died, unfortunately
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.380]   of pancreatic cancer, but just seeing incredible scientists, um, MD and, uh, scientists who really
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.660]   popularized this, the study of glia prior to that, they were seeing this kind of like back
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.400]   water science.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.040]   No one, everyone thought it was just glue for the brain.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.760]   He used to stop us in the hallways late at night and he used to, we called it getting
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.220]   bend because you'd want to leave.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.660]   And he would like, he was a night owl.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.240]   It was awful.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.180]   And you'd get stuck there, but I'll never forget.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.460]   He stopped and he called me Andy.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.800]   And he said, he did this numerous times, but he said, Andy, why?
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.440]   No one calls me that by the way, anymore.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:04.300]   Um, he said, Andy, why is it that as we get older, we have less energy?
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.240]   And I'm like, I don't know, Ben.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.340]   He's like, someone needs to, he's like, why don't you work on that?
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.380]   Why are you working on these retinal cells?
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.220]   Like you, you should work on that.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.760]   And he said, why is it that we, that our brain is less plastic?
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.020]   Like, well, I don't know.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.100]   I think it's the glia, right?
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.880]   And there is some evidence that it has something to do with the glia, um, among other things.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.340]   But there's a fundamentally interesting question.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.640]   You look at kids and they're just full of energy.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.900]   And we, there's the NAD hypothesis and there's these other, but it always seems to circle back
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:32.660]   to mitochondria.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.460]   Yes.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.300]   Over and over.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.060]   So I think the answer is very clear.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:41.820]   It's, it's, we have a ton of mitochondria early in life and over time it gets depleted.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.500]   Is it that simple?
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.320]   I mean, there are other things too.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:51.480]   There are other things, but I, I actually do think that's a, it's not just the, the number
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:58.120]   and density of mitochondria, but it's the health of mitochondria because unfortunately, you know,
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:03.380]   our cells have a process for getting rid of defective mitochondria.
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.140]   Um, it's part of autophagy.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:14.260]   There's a sub kind of category called mitophagy in which defective mitochondria should be shuttled
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.820]   to lysosomes or shuttled out of cells.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:24.900]   Recent paper actually found that microglia in the brain, again, send out these nanotunnels
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:32.580]   to astrocytes and collect defective mitochondria from the neuron and then take care of the disposal
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.140]   process for that neuron.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.080]   We are so cool.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.660]   And that when you inhibit that, it appears to increase and accelerate neurodegeneration.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:45.800]   And when you enhance that, it appears to improve, um, or reduce neurodegeneration.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.500]   But I think it is.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:55.720]   I think children have more energy because they have healthier metabolism, healthier mitochondrial
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.320]   function.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:02.380]   And when we look at like, again, like, is there evidence for that?
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.620]   There's overwhelming evidence for that.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:14.280]   There are thousands of peer reviewed, published articles in leading journals, nature, cell, like
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:20.900]   all sorts of journals over the last several decades, just to, again, try to bring this back to just
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.960]   common sense.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.980]   So we have these things called diseases of aging.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.860]   What are the diseases of aging?
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:38.220]   The diseases of aging are obesity, type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:38.840]   disorders.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:43.920]   Those are universally thought of as diseases of aging.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:52.540]   Interestingly, what often gets left off of that category are the mental disorders.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:59.120]   Especially today, a lot of people think of mental disorders as primarily a youth problem.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:11.740]   But in fact, mental disorders, depression, anxiety, psychosis are actually diseases of aging.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:22.920]   So the Center for Disease Control has put out kind of charts of any age group.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:31.680]   What is the probability if you are, you know, a youth in America today that you will be prescribed
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.800]   an antidepressant, an SSRI antidepressant?
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.320]   If you're between 20 and 40, what's the probability?
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:48.120]   Among the remaining people who are still 20 to 40, among all the people that age, as people
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:54.100]   get older, the risk for antidepressant prescription goes up.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:59.980]   The highest category of people prescribed antidepressants are 65 and older.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:00.760]   Really?
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:06.740]   Well, I guess in some sense that makes sense, although I would have thought it would be the
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.500]   younger population.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   Most people do.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.740]   And that's why I'm saying this, because it's shocking to most people.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:17.140]   It was actually surprising to me, but I was thinking, wait, if my theory is correct, then
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.260]   mental disorders should be a disease of aging.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.500]   And in fact, they are.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:27.920]   Antipsychotic prescriptions, what age group is the most likely to be prescribed an antipsychotic?
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.000]   Over age 80.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.040]   Really?
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.420]   Oh, it goes through the roof.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:40.780]   Because dementia is associated with 40 to 50% of the people with dementia will have psychotic
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.640]   symptoms, hallucinations and delusions.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:46.140]   They'll have agitation.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:50.980]   The benzodiazepines, the prescription rate goes up.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:59.620]   Now, with benzos, there is a dip starting at age 65, and that is really because physicians
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:05.040]   are explicitly told do not prescribe benzos to people over 65, so the rate starts going
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:05.480]   down.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:05.960]   Interesting.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.860]   But with antidepressants, it's almost linear.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:14.480]   The older you are, the more likely you are to be receiving a prescription for an antidepressant.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   Psychotics, there are some waves and shifts.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.500]   Women, for example, around the time of menopause get a peak.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:29.040]   So you get a peak around the age of 20, which is new onset schizophrenia, and then it kind of
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.940]   comes down a little, and then women, round time menopause, higher peak, and then it kind of
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:42.960]   comes down a little, and then late in life goes through the roof, goes through the roof, again,
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.360]   because of what we call dementia.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:54.520]   So the diseases of aging, anyway, are all of the metabolic disorders and, oh, by the way,
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.880]   the mental disorders.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.380]   And in my mind, we need to tie that together.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.820]   That is not a serotonin problem.
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:02.940]   Right.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.860]   We need to tie that science together.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:12.120]   And the only way to tie that science together is to look at the bigger picture that we call
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:12.740]   metabolism.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:18.000]   And ultimately, you have to look at mitochondria and mitochondrial biology to understand it.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.540]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.080]   Last year, I became a Function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:27.880]   to lab testing.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:33.300]   Function provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.500]   entire bodily health.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:39.320]   This snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health, immune functioning,
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.140]   nutrient levels, and much more.
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:46.060]   They've also recently added tests for toxins, such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics,
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.840]   and tests for PFASs, or forever chemicals.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.720]   Function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to your physical and mental health,
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:59.120]   but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors who are expert in the
[00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.920]   relevant areas.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.280]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function, I learned that I had a lot of
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.480]   that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.120]   Function not only helped me detect that, but offered insights into how best to reduce my
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.720]   mercury levels, which included limiting my tuna consumption.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.620]   I'd been eating a lot of tuna, while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:22.420]   with NAC and acetylcysteine, both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.160]   And I should say, by taking a second Function test, that approach worked.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.760]   Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.140]   There's so many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be detected
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.000]   in a blood test.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.540]   The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:42.700]   In contrast, I've been super impressed by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.760]   It is very affordable.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.280]   As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific advisory board, and I'm thrilled that they're
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.120]   sponsoring the podcast.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.780]   If you'd like to try Function, you can go to functionhealth.com slash Huberman.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:59.560]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people, but they're offering early access to
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.800]   Huberman podcast listeners.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.080]   Again, that's functionhealth.com slash Huberman to get early access to Function.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.040]   Let's talk about diet and nutrition for a moment.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:16.860]   In recent years, you've talked a lot about the clinical use of the ketogenic diet for various
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.380]   mental health disorders and cited some spectacular results.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:27.380]   And this has had a huge impact on everybody's thinking about what ketogenic diets originally
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.060]   were for.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.140]   It was developed as a medical treatment for epilepsy, is my understanding.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:36.780]   Only later did it become popular as a potential avenue for losing body fat, et cetera.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:45.000]   But what are some of the ways that people can use diet and nutrition to improve metabolic health
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.540]   generally?
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.520]   But let's be more specific.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.460]   Mitochondrial health, number, turnover, all the good stuff that happens in mitochondria.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:57.000]   How can nutrition be used to improve that?
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.780]   Why would it be that the ketogenic diet would improve mitochondrial function?
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:06.900]   Or is it that the ketogenic diet bypasses the need for standard cellular metabolism by pulling
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.840]   on some other cellular metabolism mechanisms?
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:20.260]   I'm just trying to draw the link here between a ketogenic diet and mitochondria because you've
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.800]   well established that mitochondria are central to this whole picture of the mental and physical
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.160]   health.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:30.800]   I'll throw in a plug before I go deep into the ketogenic diet story.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:36.020]   But you also threw a question in there about other dietary interventions or how can diet
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:36.540]   impact.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:46.320]   There is no question diet plays a profound, profound and central role to human metabolism and all of
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.140]   the consequences of human metabolism.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:54.040]   And you very eloquently laid out the case for early life.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:03.700]   A woman who's breastfeeding her infant, that breast milk has a profound impact on whether that
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.360]   baby's brain develops normally or not.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:15.740]   that has dire consequences potentially for the outcome and the health of that child.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.040]   And it's all about nutrition.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.780]   We've known that for decades, that if women are malnourished during pregnancy, it impacts that
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.220]   infants, the fetus's lifespan.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:34.680]   Really, it increases risk for mental disorders and metabolic disorders, increases risk.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:47.460]   If your mother is starving while she's pregnant or has to fast or has to go without nutrients, it increases that child's risk for metabolic disorders.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.820]   Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.600]   We've known that.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.320]   And that is, you know, there are lots of theories about obesity around that.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:07.960]   It also, surprisingly, increases risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and antisocial personality disorder and all sorts of other mental disorders.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:16.680]   In terms of other dietary patterns, I just want to, and we can do a deep dive into any of these if you want, and then I'll go on to ketogenic diets.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.780]   But ultra-processed foods, really bad for your physical health and your mental health.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.860]   We have just growing body of evidence for that.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.280]   Is that because of the increased calorie consumption?
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:44.060]   There's this really nice paper that was published a few years ago showing that people who eat above a certain threshold of processed foods tend to consume, on average, about 500 calories more than they require per day, which might not seem like much, but over time that compounds.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:54.620]   And they gain a lot of adipose tissue, and then the adipose tissue is secreting a lot of things into the bloodstream that make the whole situation even worse, both brain and bodily.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:06.100]   But aside from the caloric load, I mean, is there any evidence that these food dyes and other things that are included in these foods are detrimental to mitochondrial health?
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:12.740]   This is a somewhat controversial thing these days because some of these dyes were banned recently, which I saw as a good thing.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:23.640]   But then some of the diehards in the scientific community were like, oh, those dosages represent like 6,000-fold what you'd have to eat, what most people eat, you know, the dosages used in mice.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:29.280]   But the FDA still pulled those dyes, and the FDA is a pretty conservative body.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.700]   So I don't know.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.780]   Not every chemical is bad, of course.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.080]   But are these additives really that bad?
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:52.160]   So to try to answer your question, are the chemicals and additives harmful, the real answer is we don't actually have adequate scientific evidence one way or another.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.420]   And why don't we have adequate scientific evidence?
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.940]   Because we're not spending money to research it.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:13.420]   So right now, the rules to this day are that, you know, there's this concept called GRASS, general regarded as safe,
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:30.680]   that food companies can develop new molecules that will preserve a food, make a food hyperpalatable, make it tastier, make it more shelf-stable, whatever, whatever they want to claim it does.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:47.520]   They can put these molecules into our food, and they can get away with just saying, well, this is just generally regarded as safe without any adequate safety testing whatsoever.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:07:00.380]   Now, the new administration, RFK Jr., just recently said he's going to try to change that rule, and I welcome that change.
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:03.320]   I think that will be a phenomenal change.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:09.540]   So the reality is that testing hasn't been done on all of these molecules.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:18.060]   There are tens of thousands of molecules, like new chemicals, new additives, things that sometimes aren't even on the label.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:27.520]   That are added to food, and we really don't know for sure for each and every one of them whether this one is safe or not safe.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:39.180]   What we do know overall, and this unfortunately comes down to epidemiological studies, where they just look at hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:47.660]   and they assess, like, how much ultra-processed food is this person eating?
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.880]   And is that associated?
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:08:05.660]   If we look at large populations of people and we stratify them by these people are eating mostly ultra-processed foods, and these people are hardly eating any, are there differences in their health outcomes?
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:12.040]   And the answer to that is unequivocal, and it is perfectly clear.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:19.320]   The more ultra-processed foods you eat, the worse your physical and mental health, both.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:26.300]   It's cardiovascular disease, it's obesity, it's diabetes, it's mortality, it's cancer.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.340]   It's also a broad range of mental disorders.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:34.280]   And so we know that.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:40.180]   We've got more granular data that hyper-focuses on the mental health story.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:48.680]   You know, one study, over 300,000 people, the more ultra-processed foods you eat, a direct linear relationship.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.720]   It was shocking how linear it was.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.380]   The more ultra-processed foods you eat, the worse your mental health.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.000]   And it was so striking.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.620]   It was not a subtle difference.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:04.660]   It wasn't like, you know, oh, it was a 3% difference between the lowest.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.840]   It was a three-fold difference.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:20.600]   The people who consumed ultra-processed foods every day, multiple times a day, 58% of them had poor mental health,
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:29.140]   compared to only 18% of the people who rarely or never consumed ultra-processed foods.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:29.460]   Wow.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:35.520]   So this would be even just like somebody has like a bag of chips and some, you know,
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.740]   just pour in water type pre-made soup or something like that.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.660]   Those are ultra-processed.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:47.640]   This would be somebody orders a sandwich at the deli for lunch, which can be done in a relatively healthy way,
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.140]   depending on what's in that sandwich.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:54.340]   And then does soda and bag of chips on the side.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.140]   Like, I mean, that's a lot of, in my opinion, highly processed food.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.960]   But people, I think sometimes people don't think of it that way.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.480]   Yes.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:10.580]   One of the, I was surprised and somewhat delighted to learn that one of the ways that the, you know,
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:18.280]   the public health folks got kids to smoke fewer cigarettes, because when I was growing up, like, smoking was cool.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.660]   Like, if you smoke a cigarette, it was cool.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.460]   People thought it was cool.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.300]   Like, it definitely is reinforcing because of the nicotine, the dopamine increases.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.180]   And it was considered cool.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.440]   You had your, like, Marble Man image from the preceding decades.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:37.360]   But then it was really the 90s kind of, it was the actors and models and stuff that made it cool.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.280]   Like, people smoked and it was supposed to be cool.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:47.480]   And one of the ways that we ended up with people smoking far less was not just to ban it on campuses,
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.080]   because that just makes teens want to do it more, right?
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.200]   In college, you want to do it more.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:11:04.000]   Was to have these commercials of these, it was all, to be direct, it was just like these rich white guys in a room
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.400]   that was portraying, like, the boardroom of a tobacco company.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.840]   And they were, like, cackling and talking about, like, ha, ha, ha.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.940]   They think we're going to, they don't think it causes cancer and this kind of thing.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:20.260]   Basically, pitting youth against adults so that the youth felt like their money was being taken by the establishment.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:27.900]   So, is there a world where, you know, kids are going to be like, you know, forgive me, but, you know, like, F that.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.240]   I'm not eating Doritos, you know.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.940]   Like, I'm not going to be manipulated by highly processed foods.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:37.040]   Or I'm going to hold on to my mental health by making healthy choices in terms of food.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.480]   It's tricky, but it has a lot of the same parallels to cigarette use or alcohol use.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:47.560]   But I feel like the only way to really get Americans to change their behavior, besides scaring them fundamentally,
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.460]   but even if you do that, is to incentivize it.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:54.960]   And one of the best incentives historically for public health change has been to pit the,
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.760]   make the public feel like they're pitted against the people that are trying to take their money unfairly
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.780]   and make them unhealthy at the same time.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.000]   You got to activate that kind of rebellious spirit.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.860]   No, uh-uh, not going to do it.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.300]   Just telling people that it's bad for you doesn't work, right?
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:09.880]   We know that.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.500]   How do we incentivize people?
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:17.460]   Yeah, I'm not going to give a cliche answer because this is the trillion dollar question
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:29.540]   is what everybody's asking and it really, you know, the health of our country really kind of depends on it.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:37.840]   With billions of dollars that this industry has in revenue annually,
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:44.640]   they can spend a lot of that money on really impactful marketing campaigns,
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:53.180]   getting people to believe that it's not as unhealthy as Chris Palmer and Andrew Huberman are saying.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.460]   It's fine.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.080]   Everybody deserves a treat.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:10.120]   Within the last couple of weeks, the American Heart Association was actively lobbying against a Texas bill
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:16.840]   that was trying to restrict spending food stamp money on junk food.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.940]   I saw that clip.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.780]   It's so disturbing to see someone from the American Heart Association
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:29.220]   actively lobbying to keep tax dollars directed towards including sugary soda,
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:37.500]   not even diet soda, but sugary soda in lunches and food for people who are low income.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:45.020]   And he went on record as saying this junk food, this ultra-processed food,
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.720]   is not the root cause of obesity or diabetes or any of these health conditions,
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.700]   which is an absolute abject lie.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:14:09.640]   And when you have supposedly respected organizations being bought by industry promoting misinformation,
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.480]   it's really hard.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.440]   You know, everybody's all upset that, like, oh, people don't trust the science.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.800]   They're not respecting the respected organizations.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:27.000]   Well, the respected organizations need to step up and start behaving in a respectable manner.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.080]   They need to stop.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.180]   The American Heart Association should not be taking a dime from any industry
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:39.640]   that plays a role in heart disease.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:47.400]   Like, it would be like the American Heart Association taking money from tobacco companies
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.600]   and then coming out and say,
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.400]   smoking doesn't really cause heart disease, people.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.860]   Everybody calm down.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:57.640]   There's still a lot that we don't know.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.020]   We need more research.
[01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:00.320]   We need more research.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.280]   Smoking doesn't cause heart disease, people.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.920]   This is just scaremongering.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.400]   This is just paranoid conspiracy theories.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.920]   That is exactly what's happening now.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.000]   They're taking money from food companies
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.660]   that have no vested interest in the health of the population that they are feeding.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:29.000]   They know perfectly well that these foods are highly palatable.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.200]   And what does that mean?
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:32.980]   It means addictive.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:39.300]   And again, if I was selling food, I would want people to be addicted to the food I was selling.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:39.640]   Why?
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.580]   Because you sell more.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.540]   Higher margins.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.780]   If you sell food that people aren't addicted to,
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.900]   they'll just move on to the other food that is addictive.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.920]   And then you'll be out of business.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.220]   So it's not an easy problem to solve.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.100]   I don't mean to imply it's easy.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:00.980]   Because if one or two companies steps up and does the right thing,
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.700]   they'll just go out of business.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.960]   Well, I feel like the smoking parallel is critical.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:12.200]   And maybe the trans fat, the history of entire cities banning the use of trans fats,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.720]   for instance, or the use of a styrofoam container is a very different issue.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.960]   This doesn't directly get to human health of the styrofoam.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.400]   It's not good.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   But it's about waste and environment.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.000]   But I feel like there has to be a top-down ban.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.300]   And Americans also don't like bans, right?
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.640]   We don't like things.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.800]   We like choice.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.020]   But we don't like the consequences of choice.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:41.520]   And then we want people to fix the consequences of those choices
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.000]   with treatments that don't have side effects.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.740]   And then this is kind of the cycle that I've observed in my lifetime over and over again.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.320]   You know, I think it's the rebellion piece.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.720]   It's when people realize they're being manipulated.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.000]   Once people realize they're being manipulated,
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.040]   I feel like that's when they're willing to intervene
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.820]   and stop an otherwise reinforcing activity,
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.000]   reinforced addictive activity,
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.780]   save money, and take a different direction.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.380]   Like, that's inherent to the American spirit.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.760]   As much as we love freedom,
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.300]   we also have this, like,
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:25.180]   no, you're not going to do this to me kind of spirit.
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:25.980]   We see it everywhere.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.140]   This is my belief.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.940]   But then again, I was kind of a rebellious teen.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.280]   But if it's in service to health,
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.640]   I'm hopeful.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.920]   I mean, my understanding,
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.260]   by no means am I an expert,
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:42.740]   but my understanding of what really drove the reduction in tobacco use
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.680]   was the taxes
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.960]   and the ban on advertising,
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.400]   the ban on television advertisements.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.120]   Interesting.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.600]   That when you get rid of the advertisements,
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.700]   you're no longer tempting people with it.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:59.760]   You're no longer able to spread misinformation.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:05.060]   And when you make the product so expensive,
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.760]   people just,
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.540]   even if they want to try it,
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:12.160]   even if they're already addicted to it,
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.360]   now they are highly motivated to get off of it.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:15.740]   Why?
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.420]   Because it's costing them an arm and a leg.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:18.080]   Yeah, money hurts.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.680]   And they realize that,
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.960]   I just don't want this.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.540]   We could do similar things with ultra-processed foods.
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:29.580]   If rebellion, education, whatever,
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.280]   I don't care what works.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.260]   All of the above.
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.500]   But we're all of the above.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.480]   We're really fighting an uphill battle.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.140]   So ultra-processed foods,
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.240]   that's just one story.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.620]   Vitamin, nutrient deficiencies.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.100]   Do you want to go to ketogenic diet?
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.080]   You asked me about that,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.040]   and I got sidetracked.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.800]   Yeah, we went into a public health discourse.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.800]   We're weaving back and forth.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.640]   That's what we do here.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.440]   I think it's,
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.600]   I mean, look, it's very timely, right?
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.980]   I don't care if you're the staunchest Democrat
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.220]   or the staunchest Republican
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.240]   or somewhere in between.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.160]   These issues affect everybody.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.000]   And anyone who just wants to view Maha
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.180]   as a Republican thing,
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.920]   it's fine that I'm not affiliated with Maha.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.700]   I am in favor of improved public health
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:10.920]   from whatever angles
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.300]   that can meaningfully be done.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:16.000]   So tell us about ketogenic diet.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.840]   And then I'd like to ask about things
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.920]   that we can do to improve mitochondrial function
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.220]   in these other bins.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.820]   But does ketogenic diet
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.300]   improve mitochondrial function?
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.840]   And if so, how does that work?
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.920]   The quick summary story
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.760]   for people who don't know ketogenic,
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.980]   so ketogenic diet is a 100-year-old
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.720]   evidence-based treatment for epilepsy.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.180]   It can stop seizures
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.800]   even when medications fail to.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.000]   We have over a dozen
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.880]   controlled trials
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.320]   of ketogenic diets
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.440]   in children,
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.580]   in particular,
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.520]   with treatment-resistant epilepsy.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.220]   we have two Cochrane reviews
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.460]   that came out positive.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.200]   So Cochrane reviews
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.600]   are the gold standard
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.620]   in the medical field
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.840]   for meta-analyses.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.800]   Very rigorous.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.600]   And they analyzed the data that exists
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.880]   and came to the conclusion
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.760]   that ketogenic diet,
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.520]   if somebody has treatment-resistant epilepsy,
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.460]   compared to treatment as usual,
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.700]   which is try another
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.920]   anti-epileptic medication,
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.840]   the ketogenic diet
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.300]   is six times more likely
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.640]   to result in seizure freedom
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.660]   than just trying
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.520]   yet another epilepsy pill.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.120]   So the ketogenic diet
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.040]   is a powerful
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.480]   anti-convulsant treatment.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.420]   We use anti-convulsant treatments
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.040]   in psychiatry every day
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.900]   in tens of millions of people.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:36.400]   Lots of these medications are used.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.880]   So at this point,
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.260]   we now have
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.820]   over 50 published
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.540]   pilot trials,
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.880]   case series,
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:47.980]   case reports,
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.060]   other lines of evidence
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.120]   of the ketogenic diet
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.360]   for psychiatric disorders,
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.540]   schizophrenia,
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:57.720]   bipolar disorder,
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.260]   depression,
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:20:59.160]   anxiety,
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.520]   anorexia,
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.060]   or nebosa,
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:01.780]   surprisingly.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.640]   These 50 reports
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.420]   represent over 1,900 people.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.540]   And on balance,
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.380]   the ketogenic diet
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.940]   appears to be
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.240]   an effective treatment,
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.480]   sometimes
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.320]   an extraordinarily
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.640]   effective treatment,
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.360]   like in
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.960]   able to
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.080]   induce remission
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:24.980]   of schizophrenia
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:25.960]   or bipolar
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.900]   in people who
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.660]   otherwise had
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.160]   treatment-resistant disorders.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.180]   And they're going off
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.280]   medication simultaneously?
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.800]   Some of them are.
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:36.520]   So there are,
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.040]   you know,
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:37.720]   I have heard
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.860]   probably from
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.980]   thousands of people
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.120]   around the world
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.920]   since my work
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.020]   has become more public.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:46.780]   And actually,
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.600]   our first podcast together,
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.620]   hands down,
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.860]   the most cited
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.820]   reason people know
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.460]   who I am.
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.740]   As they should.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.140]   Well,
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.160]   I know about you,
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.000]   but it's Huberman.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.560]   That Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:00.760]   Well,
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.560]   I'm just a runway
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.360]   for people to,
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.520]   those incredible messages
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.060]   to take off.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:07.540]   Thank you again
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.740]   for the opportunity
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.020]   to disseminate this word.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:11.660]   And because
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.000]   at the end of the day,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:13.880]   I'm hearing from
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.760]   thousands of people
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.420]   who simply listened
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.680]   to that podcast,
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.280]   made changes,
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.980]   started a ketogenic diet
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:21.840]   for their schizophrenia
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.940]   or other
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.460]   treatment-resistant
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:25.300]   mental disorder,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.200]   reach out to me.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.540]   You saved my life.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:31.520]   I can't tell you
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.100]   how many times
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:32.680]   I've gotten
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.460]   handwritten notes,
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.240]   emails,
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.680]   messages from people
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.320]   who use those words.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.740]   You saved my life.
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.980]   I never met this person.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.600]   All I did
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.880]   was share this knowledge.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.480]   And then they
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.940]   saved their own lives
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.000]   with knowledge.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.580]   Coming back to your question now
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.400]   in Roundabout Way,
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.960]   does ketogenic diet
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.860]   impact mitochondrial health?
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.780]   We have
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.180]   strong evidence
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:03.360]   that it does.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.980]   And so it appears,
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.460]   so the ketogenic diet
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.540]   is mimicking
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:09.860]   the fasting state.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.340]   And I just want to
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.080]   say that
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.500]   again.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.140]   The ketogenic diet
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.140]   mimics
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.260]   the fasting state.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.120]   What does that mean?
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.140]   It means the ketogenic diet
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:22.860]   is mimicking
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.900]   no food consumption.
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:28.600]   So is the ketogenic diet
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.960]   the healthiest diet
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.120]   that everybody should follow?
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:31.640]   No,
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.400]   that's not the way
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.180]   I think about it.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.200]   The ketogenic diet
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.300]   is an intervention.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.680]   It is shifting metabolism.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.120]   It is shifting
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.560]   countless
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.220]   kind of systems,
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.520]   signaling pathways,
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.440]   other things,
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.340]   gene expression
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:48.320]   in the human body
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.000]   and brain
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.080]   and that results
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.880]   in effects.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.280]   And the good news
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.240]   is these effects
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.240]   appear to be
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.020]   life-changing
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.140]   and life-saving
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:23:59.840]   sometimes.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:00.420]   So they're
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.760]   highly beneficial
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.580]   effects.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.900]   Again,
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:05.640]   dose
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.320]   and the way
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.020]   you do it
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:07.620]   matter
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.600]   because fasting,
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.060]   the extreme version
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:11.600]   of fasting
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.700]   is starvation
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.060]   and that results
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:14.660]   in death.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.220]   so that is
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:15.780]   not at all
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:16.320]   a good thing.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.860]   So let's make sure
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:18.560]   that if you're
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.160]   going to do
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.040]   a ketogenic diet
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.340]   or a fasting regimen
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.040]   that you're not
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.720]   depriving yourself
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.400]   of essential nutrition,
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.420]   that you're getting
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.020]   enough calories,
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:28.440]   you're getting
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.120]   enough nutrients,
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:29.840]   that you're doing
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.360]   it in a medically
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.460]   sound way
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.420]   so that you're
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.300]   optimizing your health
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:34.880]   and not hurting
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.460]   your health.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.220]   But we have,
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.700]   you know,
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.740]   it's hard to measure
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:45.240]   this in humans
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.500]   in vitro
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.760]   because we can't
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.040]   like do an intervention
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.560]   to a human
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.280]   and then dissect
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:52.780]   their brain
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.860]   and like biopsy it
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:54.880]   and look at the mitochondria
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.600]   under the microscope.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.620]   So we mostly have
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.400]   animal data
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.880]   that supports this,
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.860]   but animal data
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.460]   strongly supports
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.160]   that ketogenic
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:05.940]   interventions
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.060]   improve
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.000]   mitophagy,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:10.900]   so getting rid
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:11.460]   of these old
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.620]   and defective mitochondria.
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.740]   So you're kind of
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:14.760]   cleaning house.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.920]   You're getting rid
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.980]   of the bad
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.640]   and then you're
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.460]   replacing them
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:21.880]   with new fresh ones,
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.980]   mitochondrial biogenesis,
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.460]   so that at the end
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:25.820]   of the day,
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.620]   the cell will have
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.180]   more healthy mitochondria.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.200]   Now, some researchers
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.860]   have really hyper-focused
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.160]   on the ketogenic diet
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:33.820]   might be working
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.280]   through the gut microbiome.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.460]   this gut-brain connection.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.540]   And we have some evidence
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.680]   that that is true.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.100]   So researchers
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.060]   actually took
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:45.620]   feces
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:48.620]   from human children
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:49.520]   with epilepsy
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.660]   before starting
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.660]   a ketogenic diet
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.280]   and then
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.940]   afterward
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.300]   while they were stable
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:57.440]   on a ketogenic diet.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.440]   And then they transferred
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.220]   these fecal samples
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.580]   to mice
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.820]   who were
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.560]   predisposed
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.260]   to epilepsy
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.600]   or predisposed
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.120]   to seizures.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.060]   When they took
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:09.920]   the feces
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:10.960]   from the children
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.980]   while the children
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.680]   still had
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:13.380]   or seizing,
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.920]   the mice
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.020]   were more likely
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:16.860]   to seize.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.020]   When they took
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:19.940]   the feces
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.240]   from the children
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.700]   doing the ketogenic diet
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:24.880]   and transferred it
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.520]   to the mice,
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.260]   the mice
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.380]   were less likely
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.500]   to have seizures.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.140]   Interesting.
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.380]   Even though the mice
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:31.940]   were not on ketogenic diets.
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:33.700]   So there's something
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.840]   in the feces
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.140]   of children
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.520]   with epilepsy
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.020]   doing ketogenic diets
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.660]   that has an
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.740]   anti-seizure effect.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:45.440]   What could that
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.260]   something be?
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.580]   It could be
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.700]   the gut microbiome
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.500]   but it could be
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.980]   molecules,
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.480]   neurotransmitters,
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.480]   neuropeptides,
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.420]   other things
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.240]   that those
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.160]   microbes
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.020]   are producing
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.820]   or it could be
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.440]   neuropeptides
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.660]   and other factors
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.240]   that the gut cells
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:04.900]   are producing.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.180]   So we really
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:06.660]   don't know
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:07.200]   for sure
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.500]   what exactly
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.200]   is it.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.120]   So on the surface
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.320]   there's something
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.000]   in the feces
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.660]   there's a gut microbiome
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.940]   a gut brain
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.140]   connection thing.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:17.140]   What does that
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:17.480]   have to do
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.220]   with mitochondria?
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.760]   So another
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.460]   research group
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:22.780]   did that same model
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:26.320]   got mice
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:26.960]   to have an
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.120]   anti-seizure effect
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.320]   from a ketogenic diet
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.620]   and then
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.960]   dissected their brains
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.040]   looking for
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:34.900]   what changed
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.660]   in the brain.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.140]   How exactly
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.480]   is a ketogenic diet
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.260]   having an
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.460]   anti-seizure effect
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.360]   in the brain
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.160]   because that's
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.500]   the pathology
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.840]   the pathological
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.340]   finding
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:48.740]   seizure
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:49.620]   is occurring
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:50.380]   in the brain
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.900]   and when they
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.140]   analyzed
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.480]   genetic changes
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.360]   upregulation
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.260]   downregulation
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.400]   it all
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.620]   centered on
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.500]   mitochondria
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.100]   that the
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:03.640]   changes
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.900]   in the gut
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:06.420]   were resulting
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.160]   in mitochondrial
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:08.760]   changes
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.840]   in the brain
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.720]   which means
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.960]   brain energy
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.680]   metabolism
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:13.760]   in the brain
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.860]   and
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.680]   so again
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.520]   it's
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.340]   an umbrella
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:19.840]   theory
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.680]   doesn't replace
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.300]   what we know
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:22.580]   it's not
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:23.720]   gut microbiome
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:24.700]   or serotonin
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.680]   it's not
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.720]   gut microbiome
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.660]   or mitochondria
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:28.700]   it's both
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.040]   both of them
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:30.800]   are true
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.680]   and it's all
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.400]   interconnected
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.820]   so I
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.600]   do think
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.080]   we've got
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.140]   more than
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:37.700]   enough data
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.680]   that ketogenic
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.420]   therapies
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.100]   impact
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:42.800]   brain
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.700]   metabolism
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.560]   which then
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.220]   impacts
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.640]   neurotransmitters
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.320]   that's
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.060]   really what
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:50.380]   I hope
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:50.940]   will become
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:51.380]   one of
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.100]   many
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:53.720]   really important
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.580]   studies
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.800]   published

[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.920]   that

[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:02.700]   just
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:02.860]   did
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.080]   a

[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.840]   but
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:16.980]   they
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.220]   also
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:17.500]   found

[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.420]   yes
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.160]   the answer
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:26.620]   is
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.180]   yes
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:27.680]   can

[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:35.540]   itself
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.280]   so
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:36.460]   can

[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:42.380]   a huge

[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:50.880]   and you

[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:52.480]   and i'm a believer
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.620]   in some butter
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.260]   here and there
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.280]   you were asking me
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:55.980]   about intermittent
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:56.580]   yeah
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.820]   intermittent fasting
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:01.080]   so i'll just say
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:01.520]   that
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.860]   we have a long
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.380]   history
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:04.900]   in multiple
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.180]   cultures on
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:07.620]   earth
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.420]   for thousands
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:09.300]   of years
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.280]   fasting has
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.060]   been part
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.220]   of healing
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:13.960]   rituals
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.060]   um
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.880]   india
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:18.720]   china
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.880]   christian
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.540]   fasting
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.540]   has been
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.200]   a part
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:23.700]   of
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.340]   rituals
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:25.520]   and
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.260]   you know
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:26.680]   most people
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.660]   just assume
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.280]   it's religious
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.080]   folklore
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.320]   just silliness
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:30.780]   or whatever
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.480]   but i actually
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:31.960]   think
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.100]   millennia
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:34.820]   of humans
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.480]   we're not all
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.520]   stupid idiots
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:37.160]   and that
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:37.760]   some
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.520]   people
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.180]   along the way
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:39.800]   actually notice
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.440]   this seems
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.280]   to do
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:41.720]   something
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.220]   useful
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.640]   and that's
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.100]   probably
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:44.680]   why
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.400]   it found
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:45.920]   its way
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.480]   in every
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:46.960]   culture
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.300]   and persisted
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:48.780]   for thousands
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:49.360]   of years
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:49.780]   because there
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:50.140]   was actually
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:50.460]   something
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:50.860]   meaningful
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.360]   happening
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.700]   so
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.480]   what we
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.200]   have now

[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:51.420]   research
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.100]   on it
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:52.960]   they've
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:53.400]   done
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:53.880]   a series
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:54.680]   of studies
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.160]   that
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.180]   five-day
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:56.880]   cycles
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.500]   several
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.140]   times a
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:34:59.540]   year
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.720]   seem to
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:01.480]   be fine
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.700]   and improve
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.200]   a wide
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:04.820]   range
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:05.480]   of health
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.520]   biomarkers
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:06.940]   interesting
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.080]   and there's
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:08.660]   reason to
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.220]   believe that
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:09.680]   it may
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.140]   help
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:10.920]   improve
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:11.420]   metabolic
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.100]   health
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:13.200]   and longevity
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:13.980]   so he's
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:14.660]   primarily a
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.140]   longevity
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:15.780]   aging
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.360]   researcher
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.100]   he is
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.220]   promoting
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:19.740]   that
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:20.260]   could
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:20.940]   ketogenic
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.540]   diets
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.260]   also
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:23.380]   produce
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:23.900]   similar
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:24.580]   effects
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.660]   i believe
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.460]   they can
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:27.640]   again it
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.180]   gets really
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:28.700]   controversial
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:29.280]   fast
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.420]   because
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:31.120]   ketogenic
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:31.500]   diets
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.100]   can sometimes
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:32.460]   include
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.060]   red meat
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   and then
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:34.280]   we got
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:34.700]   the american
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:34.960]   heart
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.500]   association
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.220]   telling us
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:36.660]   that red
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:37.140]   meat's bad
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:37.540]   for you
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:37.940]   and don't
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:38.240]   eat that
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:38.800]   red meat
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.260]   nonsense
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.360]   and uh
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:40.700]   well
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.400]   that we
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.040]   so
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:42.700]   and we
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:43.180]   get these
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:44.100]   splintering
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:44.500]   groups
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:44.840]   and we've
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.160]   got the
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:45.440]   vegan
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:45.800]   group
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.160]   saying
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:46.500]   that's
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:46.820]   awful
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:47.420]   for you
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:47.740]   and
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.960]   unfortunately
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:51.400]   it just
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:51.660]   leaves
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:51.980]   people
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:52.580]   confused
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.300]   about like
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:53.880]   what are
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:54.260]   we supposed
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:54.840]   to do
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.440]   do we
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:55.820]   eat red
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:55.980]   meat
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.220]   do we
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:56.620]   not eat
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:56.840]   red
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.080]   meat
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:57.400]   do we
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.160]   in moderation
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:58.940]   from healthy
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.420]   sources
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:35:59.980]   yeah
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.080]   i feel
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:01.600]   like in
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:01.980]   moderation
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.540]   from healthy
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:02.900]   sources
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:03.480]   not the
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:03.940]   processed
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:04.260]   stuff
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:04.860]   but you
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:04.940]   know
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:05.600]   i get it
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:05.980]   people have
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:06.600]   animal reasons
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.160]   or environmental
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:07.600]   reasons
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.020]   they don't
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:08.520]   do it
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:08.940]   um
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.740]   you know
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:10.420]   the debate
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:10.900]   goes on
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.160]   and on
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.820]   i've observed
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:12.320]   some people
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:12.560]   who are
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:12.780]   vegan
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:13.100]   who seem
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:13.620]   very healthy
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:14.420]   very robust
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:15.040]   um
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.040]   aesthetically
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:16.840]   they present
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:17.880]   well if i'm
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.300]   just going to be
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:18.860]   direct about it
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:19.340]   and then i've
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.020]   seen some people
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:20.420]   who go
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.540]   vegan and
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.020]   it's the
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:22.740]   exact opposite
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.400]   and then
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.020]   i've seen
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:24.600]   um
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.220]   i think the
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.080]   strict carnivore
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:26.720]   thing seems to
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.220]   work for very
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:27.800]   few people
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:28.840]   but the ones
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:29.340]   who love it
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.200]   really love it
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:30.920]   but even the
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:31.320]   folks like
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:31.980]   paul saladino
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.420]   who were
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:33.380]   the so-called
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:33.620]   you know
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.340]   carnivore diet
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:34.640]   are now
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.160]   then it became
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:35.780]   animal based
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.160]   and it now
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:36.840]   includes fruits
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.540]   and cucumbers
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:38.140]   and tomatoes
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.300]   and um
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:40.020]   some dairy
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:40.640]   and you know
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:41.200]   and so it's
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:41.860]   you know
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.460]   and honey
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:43.180]   and um
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:44.340]   and i like paul
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:44.860]   i get along
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:45.340]   well with paul
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:45.880]   i also get along
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.420]   with lane norton
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.680]   and they don't
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.120]   get along
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:48.820]   um
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:49.840]   but you know
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:50.420]   i i think
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.060]   it's it's
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:51.840]   to each their own
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:52.760]   within the context
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.180]   of um
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:54.680]   the correct
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.480]   number of calories
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.660]   for a given
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:57.060]   person
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:57.740]   and their activity
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:58.160]   levels
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.120]   but this idea
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:36:59.640]   of doing a
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.180]   periodically doing
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.820]   a perhaps a fast
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:03.500]   along the lines
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:03.940]   of the long
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.980]   go um
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:06.840]   uh prolong thing
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.500]   or uh
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.900]   or a total fast
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.560]   or water fast
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.220]   i guess it's called
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:14.020]   or um
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:16.140]   perhaps intermittent
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:16.980]   fasting on a
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:17.560]   on a more
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.860]   reasonable schedule
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:19.680]   are there any data
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.100]   on that
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.320]   like eating only
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.020]   between the hours
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:22.520]   of say
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.380]   11 a.m.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:24.140]   and 7 p.m.
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:24.540]   which is i
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.440]   which is what i happen
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.280]   to do reflexively
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:26.960]   unless i wake up
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.380]   very hungry
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.600]   which is really rare
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.200]   i don't know why
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.040]   maybe it's a function
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:30.680]   of getting older
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.180]   but is there
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:32.760]   any evidence
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.620]   that intermittent
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.540]   fasting that doesn't
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:35.560]   involve entire day
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.600]   and night fasts
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:37.440]   but more of the
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.380]   you know time
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:39.300]   restricted feeding
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.600]   to eight hours
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.260]   or six hours
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:41.860]   that it can be
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.480]   beneficial for
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.340]   mitochondrial function
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.560]   if it's done
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.040]   for short bouts
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.080]   of two to four weeks
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.700]   my understanding
[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:49.360]   of the literature
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.380]   is that
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.000]   it's a mixed
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.500]   bag
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.660]   when it comes
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:53.240]   to time
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.200]   restricted eating
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.360]   and intermittent
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.000]   fasting
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.760]   because more
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.880]   often than not
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:00.920]   they don't
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:01.560]   control what
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.600]   people are eating
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.460]   when they're
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:03.860]   eating
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.240]   oh well that's
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:05.600]   no good
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.320]   so they just
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.580]   those studies
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.760]   mostly are designed
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.500]   to just say
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.300]   don't eat
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:11.360]   only eat between
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.140]   11 a.m.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.340]   and 7 p.m.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:14.020]   because
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:14.960]   eat whatever you
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.380]   want
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.340]   but it doesn't
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:16.720]   matter like
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.500]   and as though
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.220]   it doesn't
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:18.700]   matter what
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.160]   they're eating
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:19.580]   and some
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.100]   people are
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:20.980]   binging on
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.820]   ultra processed
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:22.440]   foods
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.360]   and others
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.120]   are eating
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.040]   like an adult
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.140]   and then you've
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:27.480]   got everything
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.180]   in between
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:29.340]   as though that
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.940]   doesn't play
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.460]   a role
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:32.920]   and so you get
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:33.780]   these studies
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.260]   that say it
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:34.640]   doesn't do
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.440]   anything useful
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.260]   you get other
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:36.900]   studies that say
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:37.440]   maybe it does
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.180]   something useful
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:40.020]   so I think
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.620]   I mean
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.340]   at the end
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:42.680]   of the day
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.260]   I will say
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:43.760]   this
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.320]   you know
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.760]   I'm
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.040]   you know
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:47.240]   I've been
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:47.600]   talking
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.400]   a while
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.140]   with a
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.680]   really seasoned
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.720]   established
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.560]   expert
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.160]   in the

[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.120]   space
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:55.380]   in the
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:55.960]   conservative
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.000]   nutritional
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.580]   space
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.040]   he's held
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:58.920]   several government
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:38:59.440]   positions
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.120]   he's helped
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:00.640]   presidents
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:01.260]   and
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.760]   others
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.320]   with
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.060]   campaigns
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:04.920]   and
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.780]   he has
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:06.400]   made a
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.080]   very strong
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.040]   case to me
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.260]   that
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.500]   you know
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:10.880]   less than
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.960]   five percent
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:14.180]   of the research

[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.300]   is spent
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:16.980]   on nutritional
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:17.820]   research
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.920]   the NIH
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.020]   has
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:22.980]   an office
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.600]   called the

[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.880]   which is a
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.340]   joke
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:52.960]   it is a
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:53.660]   laughable
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:54.080]   joke
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:54.400]   can't do
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:54.800]   much with
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.040]   that
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:55.660]   and
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:56.340]   without
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:57.040]   trying to
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:57.400]   make this
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:57.920]   political
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.560]   there have
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.140]   been people
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:39:59.640]   who've tried
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.200]   to increase
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:00.860]   the funding
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.180]   for
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:02.980]   nutrition
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:03.700]   research
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:06.700]   recently
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:07.280]   was proposed
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.000]   to increase
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:08.540]   that funding
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:09.460]   to 130
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:09.900]   million
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:10.460]   dollars
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:12.140]   and it
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.060]   was cut
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.720]   that idea
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.480]   was killed
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.080]   by the
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.920]   lobbyists
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.220]   of the
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:21.220]   food companies
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:21.820]   I'm going to
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:22.160]   get really
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:22.700]   vocal about
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.340]   this lobbying
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:23.760]   through the
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.220]   American Heart
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:24.560]   Association
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.380]   thing because
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:26.360]   I was just
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.220]   shocked
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.060]   for all the
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:28.660]   obvious reasons
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:29.260]   American Heart
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:29.800]   Association
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.300]   you assume
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:30.680]   that they
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.100]   are all
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:31.300]   about
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:31.640]   healthy
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:31.960]   hearts
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.220]   and we
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:32.360]   know
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:32.820]   metabolism
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.100]   is
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.760]   healthy
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.200]   weight
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:35.420]   and
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:35.880]   activity
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.040]   and
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:36.160]   all
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:36.300]   that
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:36.400]   is
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:36.640]   healthy
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:36.860]   for
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:37.120]   hearts
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:37.420]   and it
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:37.900]   was so
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:38.160]   clear
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:38.420]   that they
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:38.700]   were on
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.120]   the take
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.180]   from these
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:40.380]   food
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:40.740]   companies
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:41.260]   and that's
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:41.600]   why they
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:41.780]   sent
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.480]   even just
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:42.980]   the timing
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.280]   and the
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:43.540]   delivery
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:44.020]   again I'll
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:44.520]   post to the
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:44.680]   link
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:45.120]   because it's
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:45.960]   just like
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.180]   jaw-dropping
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:47.780]   like I can't
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:48.160]   believe this
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:48.460]   it's like
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.120]   the old
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:50.540]   commercials
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:51.000]   of the people
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:51.480]   from the
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:51.740]   cigarette
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:52.140]   industry
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:52.520]   saying
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.520]   the cigarettes
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.080]   don't cause
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.440]   cancer
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.280]   and they know
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:55.780]   it does
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:56.680]   and we're
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:57.260]   just this is
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:57.840]   happening now
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.600]   in real time
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.560]   and this
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.260]   conversation will
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:00.860]   certainly assist
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:01.540]   in drawing
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:02.100]   attention to
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:02.420]   this I'll
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:02.780]   probably do a
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:03.260]   social media
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:03.940]   post on it
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.320]   as well
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.120]   but there's
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.340]   this this
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:06.900]   thing that
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:07.500]   happens in
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.060]   medicine and
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:08.660]   public health
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:09.760]   where the
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.660]   thing that's so
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:11.400]   obviously the
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.180]   problem is like
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:12.680]   it's not even
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.400]   staring us in
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:13.900]   the face it's
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:14.560]   like slapping
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.020]   us in the
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:16.100]   face and we
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.460]   take 20 to
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.180]   30 years
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.520]   relying largely
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.780]   on messaging
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:22.720]   through Hollywood
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.420]   what actors
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:24.780]   are doing
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.320]   what athletes
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:25.620]   are doing
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.000]   then people
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:26.400]   are like oh
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:26.880]   yeah maybe
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.320]   this is a
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:27.680]   thing and
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:28.620]   then think
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.480]   the battleship
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.520]   just like
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.460]   eventually just
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.980]   pivots but
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.340]   there's been
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.160]   decades of
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.480]   horrible
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.580]   misfortune and
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:37.420]   loss in
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.200]   mental health
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:38.600]   and physical
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.060]   health people
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:39.520]   thinking that
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:39.880]   there's something
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.500]   wrong with
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.200]   them or you
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.680]   know etc
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.160]   etc I mean
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.420]   it's asinine
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.240]   it's crazy
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.520]   and so I'm
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.180]   excited about
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:49.820]   Maha even
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:50.200]   though I don't
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:50.460]   have any
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.180]   affiliation to
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:51.660]   it because it
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:53.020]   it's it's the
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.440]   first time in
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:53.940]   my lifetime
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:56.200]   that anyone
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:56.800]   said like hey
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.220]   let's actually
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:57.880]   just talk about
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:58.300]   and think about
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:41:58.760]   how to really
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:41:59.160]   get healthy
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:41:59.480]   what do we
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:41:59.840]   know right
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.980]   now and
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:01.740]   so I'm not
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:02.120]   a political
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:02.820]   person but I
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.140]   think it's
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.020]   really important
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.160]   that we get
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.720]   focused on what's
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.680]   literally slapping
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:09.260]   us right in the
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:10.560]   face with like
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.460]   this is absurd
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.440]   forgive me for
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.360]   editorializing here
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.040]   but we keep
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:14.700]   coming back to
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:15.580]   this we know
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:16.360]   what we need
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:16.720]   to do
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.780]   we know
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:18.300]   what we need
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:18.980]   to do but
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.020]   yeah we have
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:20.560]   not had the
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.200]   political will
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:21.820]   to do it
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.720]   I think the
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.660]   hope is that
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:26.100]   one hopefully
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:26.760]   of many good
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.560]   things that
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.320]   could come out
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.180]   of Maha
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:32.460]   is separating
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.640]   industry interests
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.060]   from the health
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.260]   and welfare
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.680]   of the American
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.380]   population
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:42.920]   I think if we
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.860]   can do that
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:45.160]   and we can
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:45.980]   begin doing
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.760]   unbiased
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.460]   research
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:48.860]   to really
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.420]   determine
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.820]   what is it
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:51.300]   about ultra
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.260]   processed foods
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.640]   that results
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.280]   in harm
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:56.120]   we know
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:56.660]   they result
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.140]   in harm
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:57.640]   is it just
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:57.980]   that they're
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:42:58.720]   so delicious
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.300]   that people
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:42:59.860]   consume
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.020]   extra calories
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:02.240]   and it's
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:02.900]   still just as
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:03.420]   simple as
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:03.840]   calories
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.460]   or is it
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:05.920]   that there's
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.460]   something in
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.060]   those chemicals
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.460]   that makes
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.120]   the foods
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:09.640]   addictive
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.100]   or is it
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:11.500]   that there's
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:12.000]   something in
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.260]   those chemicals
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.160]   that actually
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:14.880]   impairs
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.600]   mitochondrial
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.180]   function
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.540]   I think we
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.160]   have evidence
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.020]   to support
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:19.700]   all three
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.320]   of those
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.220]   hypotheses
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.980]   do people
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.360]   consume
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:23.660]   extra
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:24.000]   calories
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.420]   yes
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:24.920]   you cited
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.540]   one of
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:26.660]   now many
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:27.100]   studies
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:27.780]   documenting
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:28.280]   that
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:29.220]   are they
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:29.680]   addictive
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.680]   yes
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:31.400]   unequivocally
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.340]   they are
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.260]   I mean the
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:34.820]   most common
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:35.600]   eating disorder
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:36.560]   diagnosed today
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.040]   in the United
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.040]   States is called

[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.440]   disorder
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.340]   what are the
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.080]   criteria for
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:42.680]   binge eating
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:43.200]   disorder
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.400]   basically
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.140]   addiction to
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:46.720]   ultra processed
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.220]   foods
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.180]   is really
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:48.760]   if you look
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.480]   at the criteria
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.080]   and if you
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:50.580]   look at the
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.120]   behaviors
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.400]   when people
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.080]   engage in
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:53.700]   binges
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:54.480]   they're not
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:54.940]   binging
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.200]   on steak
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:56.840]   and broccoli
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.140]   ever
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:00.840]   like never
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.080]   never are they
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:02.800]   binging on

[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:03.780]   broccoli
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.420]   they're binging
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:07.740]   almost exclusively
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:08.900]   on ultra processed
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:09.500]   foods
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.420]   and then they go
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:11.880]   through these
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:12.720]   cycles where they
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:13.580]   binge on them
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:13.980]   and then they
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:14.520]   beat themselves
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:15.180]   up and they
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.100]   feel disgusting
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:16.820]   and they're
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:17.780]   ashamed
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:18.280]   and they're
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.240]   humiliated
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.260]   and
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.260]   and then
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:22.780]   they try
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:23.280]   their best

[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:24.420]   knuckle it
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:24.920]   to avoid
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.720]   those foods
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.260]   and then
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.140]   something bad
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:27.760]   happens in

[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:29.960]   somebody
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.820]   cuts them
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.240]   off in

[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:32.220]   they've had
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:32.740]   a hard day
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:33.180]   at work
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:33.680]   their boss
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.180]   came down

[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:34.840]   whatever
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:35.740]   and
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.320]   and then
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:36.720]   they go
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:37.240]   home and

[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:47.100]   and I
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:47.900]   may as well
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:48.940]   just enjoy
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:49.540]   myself
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:50.620]   and just
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.040]   like an
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:51.540]   alcoholic
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:51.960]   would
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:52.560]   just like
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.140]   a cocaine
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:53.640]   addict
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.080]   would
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.560]   it's not
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.160]   that people
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:57.620]   are using
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.280]   every single
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:58.720]   day
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.780]   you know
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:00.100]   they go
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:00.280]   through
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:00.840]   cycles
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:01.680]   and
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.400]   it's
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:04.800]   really
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.400]   tragic
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:05.960]   Harvard

[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:06.940]   School
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:07.500]   just
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.060]   literally
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:08.600]   two days
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:08.900]   ago
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:09.400]   came out
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:09.680]   with an
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.060]   article
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:10.720]   is sugar
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.240]   addictive
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:13.700]   and their
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:14.220]   conclusion
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:14.860]   no
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:15.700]   no
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:16.100]   because
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:16.420]   sugar
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:16.760]   is found
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.220]   in fruit
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:17.520]   so it
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:17.740]   can't
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:17.840]   be
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:18.140]   addictive
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:18.880]   I'm like
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.320]   really
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:19.820]   is that
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:20.140]   and they
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.000]   not the same
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:21.340]   sugar
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:21.700]   they went
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.280]   out of their
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:22.960]   way to say
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:23.580]   well you know
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.560]   like it's not
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.080]   like addictive
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:25.860]   like alcohol
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:26.700]   and nicotine
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:27.380]   because people
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.020]   sometimes have
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.000]   trouble stopping
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.120]   those completely
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.580]   and I'm
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:31.900]   thinking
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.940]   and what
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.360]   do you think
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:33.820]   is different
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:34.620]   about sugar
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:35.440]   like
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.660]   do you
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.120]   really
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.740]   don't
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:39.280]   understand
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:39.920]   that some
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.200]   people
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.020]   can't
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:41.540]   stop
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:42.920]   consuming

[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.140]   really
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:48.440]   don't
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:48.820]   understand

[01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:56.800]   certainly
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.080]   not
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:57.460]   not any

[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:58.780]   also I
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:45:58.880]   think
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:45:59.240]   important
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:45:59.740]   that the

[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:03.240]   and the

[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:04.300]   right
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:04.440]   we're
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:04.620]   not
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:05.000]   talking

[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:09.080]   pastries
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:09.500]   I think
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:09.820]   sometimes
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:10.400]   people think
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.040]   oh I'll
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:11.600]   never have
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.000]   a muffin
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:12.380]   again
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:12.860]   I'll never
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:13.560]   have a chocolate
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:13.940]   croissant
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:14.580]   that's not
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:15.280]   really what
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:15.720]   we're talking
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:16.060]   about
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:16.820]   we're not
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:17.300]   talking about
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:17.920]   a homemade

[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:18.800]   we're not
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.180]   talking about
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:19.520]   cupcakes
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.140]   we're talking
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:20.500]   about
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.460]   things that
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.360]   are easily
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:23.100]   purchased

[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:25.160]   unpackaged
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:25.520]   eaten
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.340]   in transit
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:27.060]   what we're
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:27.540]   doing I
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.240]   I realize
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:29.080]   is painting
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:29.700]   this picture
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:30.820]   of a little
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:31.160]   bit of the

[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.040]   the recent
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:32.440]   past
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:33.060]   but what
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:33.280]   you do
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:33.840]   so beautifully
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:34.260]   is you
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:35.160]   you're really
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:36.000]   orienting us
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:36.580]   where we are
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:37.000]   now
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:37.700]   and that
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.020]   the fact
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:38.440]   that we
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:38.780]   need more
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.140]   science
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:39.480]   but we
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:39.920]   we know
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.260]   an awful
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:40.660]   lot
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.180]   and there's
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:41.540]   so much
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:41.840]   that we
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:42.300]   can do
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:43.120]   and these
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:43.720]   six pillars
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.640]   of diet

[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:55.500]   could we
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:55.980]   talk about
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:56.360]   some of

[01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.100]   we can
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:46:59.360]   do for

[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.180]   these days
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:02.520]   we're hearing

[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.140]   what are
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:05.400]   the data
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.180]   on creatine

[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:21.640]   I
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:22.060]   do
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:22.520]   how
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:22.940]   can
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:23.080]   I
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:23.420]   change
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:23.660]   my
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:24.000]   life
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:24.300]   and my
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:24.820]   lifestyle
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:25.880]   to improve
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:26.460]   my health
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:27.900]   and
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:28.820]   so I
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:29.000]   just
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.200]   yeah I just want to drill that home for people
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.840]   for better or worse
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.760]   I
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:34.780]   I
[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:34.840]   I
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:34.880]   I
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:35.500]   learned about
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.400]   methylene blue
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.540]   from owning fish tanks
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.800]   you clean fish tanks
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.940]   with them
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:41.460]   or it's a
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.460]   thing you use
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:44.780]   now
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:46.940]   there's a lot of interest in methylene blue
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.640]   ever since
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.540]   a video of Robert Kennedy putting methylene blue in his
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.180]   water on a plane
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:53.600]   kind of went viral
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.660]   methylene blue has been around a very long time
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:57.900]   what are your thoughts on it
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:58.800]   what does it do
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:53:59.180]   is it
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:00.720]   going to help mitochondria
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.980]   is it for everybody
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:03.100]   I don't take it
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.960]   I don't take it either
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.480]   and I've not
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.040]   used it in any patients
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.000]   so far
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.920]   but I'm very interested in
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:11.540]   possibly
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.960]   starting
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.240]   to use it
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.800]   in controlled
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.820]   ways
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.600]   and patients
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.460]   who clearly need something more
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:21.120]   we're doing all of the right things
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.540]   we're doing the lifestyle things
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.060]   we're doing ketogenic interventions
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:24.800]   or other things
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.840]   and they still are not well
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.580]   there's still room for improvement
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:32.560]   so methylene blue
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.520]   as you said
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:34.100]   has been around
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.280]   for a long time
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.720]   it's relatively cheap
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.800]   as a
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.700]   as a fish tank cleaner
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.560]   methylene blue
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.560]   fascinatingly
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.500]   is
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.420]   primarily
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:47.680]   exclusively
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.280]   a
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.780]   mitochondrial
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.440]   agent
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:53.320]   so it is an
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:53.980]   electron
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:55.720]   acceptor
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:56.520]   and donor
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.080]   so that is what
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.280]   methylene blue does
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.180]   it can accept
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:02.100]   electrons
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.240]   and it can donate
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:03.880]   electrons
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.340]   so it's an electron
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:05.960]   shuttle
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.760]   if you will
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.620]   and
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:09.140]   how does that relate
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:10.060]   to mitochondria
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:11.140]   mitochondria
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:12.080]   as they are producing
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:12.780]   ATP
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.620]   electrons are flowing
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:16.120]   down the electron
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.140]   transport chain
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:19.160]   and that is what
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:20.140]   results in
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:20.900]   the production
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.700]   of ATP
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.040]   if it gets
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.080]   shuttled through
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.340]   the uncoupling protein
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:26.380]   it results in
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:26.880]   heat
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:27.640]   production
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:30.420]   and when
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.120]   electrons
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.940]   flow out
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:33.820]   of that system
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:34.600]   when they leak
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.520]   out of that system
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:36.440]   it creates
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.480]   reactive oxygen
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.000]   species
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:38.720]   which again
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:39.900]   are very harmful
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:41.160]   to both mitochondria
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:41.840]   and cells
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.500]   so if you have
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.460]   dysfunctional
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:45.340]   mitochondria
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:47.640]   that don't
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.240]   seem to be
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.220]   able to
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:50.560]   contain
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.620]   the electrons
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.520]   appropriately
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.560]   electrons are
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:55.320]   leaking out
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.400]   so these would
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.420]   be mitochondria
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.380]   that are producing
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:55:59.560]   more reactive
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:00.620]   oxygen species
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.640]   than they should
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.640]   does that ever
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:04.080]   happen
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:04.880]   in biology
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.500]   100%
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:07.040]   we've got
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.280]   decades of evidence
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.860]   that aging
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:11.600]   neurodegeneration
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:13.260]   even obesity
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:14.400]   type 2 diabetes
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.240]   and a wide
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:16.720]   range of
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.620]   neuropsychiatric
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:18.120]   disorders
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.240]   are associated
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.780]   with that
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:21.640]   process
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:22.680]   the increased
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:23.380]   levels
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:24.520]   of reactive
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:25.820]   oxygen species
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:27.160]   often referred to
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:28.040]   as oxidative
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:28.620]   stress
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:29.980]   so we got
[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:30.660]   decades of
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:31.060]   evidence
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:31.980]   strongly
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:33.080]   supporting that
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.660]   can methylene
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:36.400]   blue play a
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.000]   role in that
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:37.620]   absolutely
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:38.320]   because methylene
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.060]   blue can come
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:39.960]   in and take
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:40.560]   some of
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.020]   these
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.440]   wayward
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:43.320]   electrons
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.340]   and
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.660]   prevent them
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:47.680]   from creating
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.720]   reactive oxygen
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:49.300]   species
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:50.540]   which might
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:51.480]   help
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.640]   calm things
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.020]   down
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.760]   one of the
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.360]   challenges
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.940]   with methylene
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.340]   blue
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:56:58.600]   as we discussed
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.580]   before you can
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:00.220]   have too little
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:01.000]   and too much
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.400]   same with methylene
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:02.740]   blue
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:04.060]   you can have too
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:04.520]   little and too
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:04.820]   much
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:05.980]   you don't
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:06.500]   want to
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:07.760]   accept too
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.640]   many electrons
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.600]   these electrons
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.340]   need to be
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:10.880]   flowing
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.000]   to the places
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:12.660]   they should be
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:13.020]   flowing
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.220]   as opposed to
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:16.720]   oxidative stress
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:17.440]   the polar
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.400]   opposite of that
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:18.780]   is called
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:20.520]   reductive stress
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.240]   and that
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.060]   too has been
[01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:23.940]   found in
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:24.440]   people with
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:24.900]   schizophrenia
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:25.820]   and bipolar
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:26.360]   disorder
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:26.780]   and some
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:27.540]   other disorders
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.640]   so it's
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.620]   really about
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.920]   dysregulated
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.320]   kind of
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.220]   balance
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:34.460]   between oxidative
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:35.120]   and reductive
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:35.680]   stress
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:36.860]   and methylene
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:37.320]   blue
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.780]   if you
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:39.460]   take it
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:40.000]   in overdose
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.460]   could become
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:42.300]   a reductive
[01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:43.140]   stressor
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.860]   so you don't
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:45.420]   want too
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.100]   much
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:47.200]   but
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.480]   so we
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.180]   do have
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:51.000]   pilot
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:51.460]   trials
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:51.760]   again
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:52.700]   small
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:54.320]   not
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:54.780]   super
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.460]   well done
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:56.140]   pilot
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:56.680]   trials
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:57.280]   in a
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:57.940]   wide range
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:57:58.440]   of
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.120]   neuropsychiatric

[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:06.880]   others
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.040]   many
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:09.740]   of them
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:10.880]   suggesting
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.340]   a benefit
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:13.560]   do you know
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:13.880]   what the
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:14.140]   dose
[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.080]   range
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.380]   is
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:17.280]   I don't
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:17.620]   off the top
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.160]   of my head
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:18.480]   yeah
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:19.660]   because methylene
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:20.140]   blue as I
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:20.480]   understand
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:20.940]   has some
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.680]   MAO
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.200]   activity
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:22.780]   the
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:23.920]   can adjust
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.240]   some of
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:24.700]   the enzymes
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:25.320]   that in
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:25.960]   turn adjust
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:26.700]   levels of
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:27.500]   serotonin
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.800]   which is why
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.500]   I haven't
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:31.340]   taken it
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:31.780]   I've just
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.360]   been cautious
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:32.740]   about
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:33.980]   I don't really
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:34.440]   want to boost
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.180]   my serotonin
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:35.540]   there's this
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.160]   recent study
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:36.740]   out of a lab
[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:37.120]   at Stanford
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:37.620]   showing that
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:38.720]   the rewarding
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:39.220]   properties
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.360]   of various
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.000]   things as we
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:41.600]   know increase
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:42.140]   dopamine
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:42.960]   in anticipation
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:43.900]   of a reward
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:45.580]   but also
[01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:46.480]   important it
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:46.800]   seems
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:47.160]   these are
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:47.720]   mouse studies
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.600]   but serotonin
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:50.800]   drops as
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:51.540]   dopamine goes
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.540]   up and
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:53.280]   that drop
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.120]   in serotonin
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:55.600]   is at
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.220]   least as
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:56.740]   important as
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:57.240]   the increase
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:57.720]   in dopamine
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:58.100]   for the
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:58.600]   reinforcing
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.600]   properties of
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.460]   certain
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.320]   behaviors and
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:01.880]   substances
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:04.300]   and I'm
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:04.860]   very reluctant
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:06.040]   to tamper
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:06.680]   with anything
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.120]   that would
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.500]   raise serotonin
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:08.920]   because in
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.700]   these studies
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:11.000]   or these
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:11.440]   experiments
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.700]   or in
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:12.860]   these
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:13.420]   experiments
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:13.780]   I should
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:14.060]   say
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:16.260]   increasing
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.220]   serotonin
[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:19.600]   offset some
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:19.800]   of the
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:20.220]   rewarding
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:20.700]   aspects
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:21.200]   of
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:22.880]   otherwise
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.520]   rewarding
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.320]   things
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:25.360]   so I want
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:25.720]   things that
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:26.180]   are rewarding
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:26.520]   to feel
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:26.980]   rewarding
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:27.780]   and so
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:28.600]   this difference
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:29.300]   between dopamine
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:30.020]   and serotonin
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:30.580]   seems pretty
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:30.960]   vital
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.560]   I mean
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:31.900]   that's not
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:32.180]   to say
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:32.520]   I'm
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:33.260]   terrified
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:33.980]   of anything
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:34.600]   that increases
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:35.300]   serotonin
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:36.460]   but to do
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.280]   it pharmacologically
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:37.860]   just seems
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:38.480]   a little
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.340]   sketchy
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:39.840]   given I don't
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.160]   have a
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:40.720]   clinical need
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.040]   that I'm
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:41.340]   at least
[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:41.700]   not that I'm
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.080]   aware of
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.000]   well and that's
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:43.400]   actually one
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:44.100]   of the warnings
[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:46.040]   with methylene
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:47.080]   blue is that
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.300]   if taken in
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:48.980]   to have a
[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:49.600]   dose you can
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.020]   actually get
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:50.500]   serotonin
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:50.940]   syndrome
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:51.480]   could you
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:51.900]   explain what
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:52.380]   serotonin
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.020]   syndrome is
[01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:53.900]   so serotonin
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:54.460]   syndrome is
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:55.580]   just like
[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:57.260]   really excessive
[01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.920]   deluge of
[01:59:58.920 --> 01:59:59.860]   serotonin in
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:00.560]   the system
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.520]   more often
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:03.020]   than not
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:03.860]   it's completely
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:05.020]   unrecognized
[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.360]   really
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.820]   it gets
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.420]   mistaken
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:09.040]   for
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:09.820]   psychiatric
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:10.780]   symptoms
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.960]   so people
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.920]   can have
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:15.580]   anxiety
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:16.060]   they can
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:16.840]   have panic
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.060]   in extreme
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:18.800]   cases you
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:19.200]   can get
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:19.960]   nausea
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:20.280]   you can
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:20.960]   get fevers
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.600]   you can
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:21.900]   get
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:23.180]   I mean
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:23.900]   in extreme
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:24.300]   cases it
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:24.540]   can be
[02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:24.880]   fatal
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:26.440]   so it's
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:27.060]   a serious
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:27.560]   thing
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:28.300]   but more
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:28.800]   often than
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:29.160]   not it
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:29.940]   gets dismissed
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.980]   because serotonin
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:31.540]   syndrome is
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:32.540]   most commonly
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:33.540]   experienced by
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:34.500]   people taking
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.660]   SSRIs
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:37.800]   and by
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:38.340]   definition
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:38.860]   they are
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.300]   psychiatric
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:39.960]   patients
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:40.300]   where they
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:40.580]   have a
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:40.980]   mental health
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:41.440]   condition
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.800]   and so
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.060]   when they
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:43.500]   come in
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:43.960]   and say
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:44.540]   I'm feeling
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:45.160]   nauseous
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:45.620]   I feel
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:46.040]   anxious
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:46.600]   I feel
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:47.060]   jittery
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:47.480]   I feel
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:47.980]   I don't
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:48.600]   feel right
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.720]   they get
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:51.440]   written off
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:52.120]   more often
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:52.700]   than not
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:53.060]   or given
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:53.860]   more medication
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:54.500]   yeah let's
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:55.100]   increase your
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:55.600]   dose
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:56.760]   increase your
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:57.140]   dose
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:57.820]   or whatever
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:58.940]   so it's
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:00:59.780]   actually really
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:00.940]   tragic
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:01.600]   I mean one
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:02.240]   woman actually
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:02.840]   reached out
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:03.300]   to me
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:03.680]   who
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:06.020]   after learning
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:06.400]   about my
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:06.860]   work
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:08.240]   reading my
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:08.660]   book
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:09.660]   she talked
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:09.920]   to her
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:10.340]   psychiatrist
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:11.120]   tapered off
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:11.460]   all her
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:11.940]   meds
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:12.280]   and it
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.060]   became clear
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:13.400]   that she
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.140]   probably had
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:14.800]   serotonin
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.260]   syndrome
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:15.700]   for a
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:15.900]   long
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:16.320]   time
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.240]   to both
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:17.440]   her
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:17.820]   and her
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:18.340]   psychiatrist
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:18.980]   so the
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:19.420]   meds were
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:19.900]   causing the
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:20.240]   problem
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:20.840]   and the
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:21.300]   meds were
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:21.800]   causing the
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:22.180]   problem
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:23.520]   and nobody
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:24.460]   really recognized
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:25.140]   it
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.340]   again so
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:27.880]   it's
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:29.320]   so anyway
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:30.080]   methylene
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:30.840]   blue can
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:31.600]   cause serotonin
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:31.920]   syndrome
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.500]   so I think
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:33.860]   if people
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:34.160]   are gonna
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:35.300]   if people
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:35.560]   want to
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:36.020]   consider
[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:36.760]   using it
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:37.240]   I would
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:38.280]   number one
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:38.680]   make sure
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.120]   you get
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:39.720]   a very
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:40.240]   reputable
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:40.900]   source of
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:41.140]   it
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:41.940]   make sure
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:42.180]   you're
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:42.880]   consuming it
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:43.340]   in a way
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.260]   that makes
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:44.860]   sense
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.160]   I mean
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:45.420]   it can
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:45.980]   stain your
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:46.340]   teeth
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:46.740]   blue
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:47.080]   and all
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:47.580]   sorts of
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:47.900]   stuff
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:48.140]   so
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:48.980]   make sure
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:49.340]   urine
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:49.620]   blue
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:49.820]   your
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:50.120]   tongue
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:50.460]   blue
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:51.000]   but
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.560]   people
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:52.780]   will
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:53.560]   do
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:54.400]   IV infusions
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.100]   of methylene
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:55.480]   blue
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.100]   so yeah
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.480]   I've seen
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:58.900]   people
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:00.300]   kind of
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:00.840]   hooked up
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.600]   to IVs

[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:38.300]   I don't
[02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:38.440]   think
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:38.560]   it's
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:38.760]   just

[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:48.820]   see

[02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:58.120]   turns
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.200]   we need
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:08:59.480]   to pull
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:08:59.820]   back
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:00.020]   I mean
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:00.220]   there's
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:00.460]   something
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:00.720]   weird
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:00.940]   about
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:01.100]   our
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:01.420]   species
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:01.620]   that
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:01.740]   we
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:01.940]   love
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:02.080]   to
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:02.340]   develop
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:02.920]   technology
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:03.180]   and
[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:06.500]   find
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:07.160]   the
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:07.540]   destructive
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:07.980]   aspects
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:08.140]   of
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:08.300]   those
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:08.740]   technologies
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:09.180]   then pull
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:09.500]   back
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:09.820]   and a lot
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:10.100]   of our
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:10.860]   it's like
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:11.240]   two steps
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:11.480]   forward
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:11.880]   one step
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:12.120]   back
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:12.340]   type
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:12.820]   evolution
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:13.960]   it seems
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:14.340]   inherent
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:14.800]   to
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.600]   homo sapiens
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.400]   forgive me
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:16.740]   for getting
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:17.820]   so macroscopic
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:18.260]   here but
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:18.960]   when you look
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:19.200]   through
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:20.340]   there's a
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:20.780]   wonderful book
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:21.140]   the prince
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:21.700]   of medicine
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:22.660]   history of
[02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:23.020]   medicine
[02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:23.520]   Galen
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:23.940]   and like
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:24.340]   it starts
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:24.640]   there
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:25.380]   and all
[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:25.660]   the way
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:25.980]   forward
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:26.840]   and you
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.260]   read like
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:27.480]   the
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.120]   what is it
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:28.460]   the emperor
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.240]   of all maladies
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:29.840]   about cancer
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:30.060]   and you
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:30.220]   just
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:30.560]   realize
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:31.660]   we're
[02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:32.100]   stumbling
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:32.540]   forward
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:32.980]   and making
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:33.660]   miraculous
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:34.920]   progress
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.220]   and at
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:36.500]   the same
[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:36.740]   time
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:37.360]   we are
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:39.300]   seemingly
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:41.120]   deliberately
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:41.780]   overlooking
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:42.180]   a lot of
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:42.520]   the stuff
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:42.880]   that's just
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:43.400]   obvious
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:44.020]   it's like
[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.100]   the old
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:45.560]   advice
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:46.880]   as we exit
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:47.460]   this conversation
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:48.120]   about supplements
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.340]   the old
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:49.840]   advice
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:50.880]   that if you
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:51.380]   just eat a
[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:52.080]   balanced diet
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:52.620]   you're good
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:53.560]   doesn't work
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:53.960]   anymore
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:54.900]   I noticed
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:55.500]   that because
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:55.980]   quote unquote
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:56.840]   balanced diet
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:57.240]   first of all
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:57.600]   no one can
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:58.000]   agree on
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:58.300]   that
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:00.200]   and
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:00.980]   people get
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:01.400]   caught up
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:01.740]   in the
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:02.380]   vegetarian
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:02.780]   versus
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:03.380]   carnivore
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:03.720]   debates
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:04.020]   which are
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:04.220]   really
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:04.440]   like
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:04.660]   or
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:04.940]   vegan
[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:05.220]   versus
[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:05.400]   carnivore
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:05.680]   which are
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:05.840]   really
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:06.120]   at the
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:06.720]   extremes
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:07.740]   so we've
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:08.440]   lost our
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:09.320]   our bearings
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:09.920]   we're kind
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:10.220]   of like
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:10.660]   like true
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:11.060]   north
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:11.820]   is so
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:12.240]   clear
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:12.760]   what true
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.020]   north
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:13.420]   is
[02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:14.100]   it's
[02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:16.380]   mostly
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:17.160]   non-processed
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:17.480]   minimally
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:17.860]   processed
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:18.280]   foods
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:18.560]   getting
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:18.900]   adequate
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:19.380]   quality
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:19.920]   protein
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.260]   you could
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:20.360]   do
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:20.520]   that
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:21.000]   vegetarian
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:21.260]   you could
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:21.360]   do
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:21.520]   that
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:21.700]   with
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:21.900]   some
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:22.140]   animal
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:22.360]   based
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:22.720]   products
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:23.040]   if you
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:23.340]   if you
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:23.620]   choose
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:24.140]   it's
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:24.620]   doing
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:24.780]   that
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:25.540]   for 90%
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:26.240]   or 80%
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:26.540]   one's
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:26.980]   nutrition
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:27.260]   it's
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:27.640]   exercise
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:28.060]   we know
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:28.500]   what forms
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:29.480]   like all
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:30.180]   the information
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:30.600]   is there
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:30.900]   as you're
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:31.460]   pointing out
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:32.600]   but somehow
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:33.020]   we're just
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:33.480]   going to have
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:33.820]   to keep
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:34.620]   putting it
[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:35.120]   back in our
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:35.480]   faces
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:37.880]   or see
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:38.260]   enough
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:39.120]   unfortunate
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:39.560]   stuff
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:39.980]   that we
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:40.600]   go away
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:40.900]   a second
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:41.680]   like this
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:42.260]   is time
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:42.700]   for a course
[02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:43.100]   correction
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:43.760]   but hey
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:44.040]   that's what
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:44.320]   we're trying
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:44.540]   to do
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:44.740]   here
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:45.040]   right
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:45.540]   and
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:46.220]   and we
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:46.540]   have
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:48.380]   we have
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:49.020]   colleagues
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:50.000]   to do
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:50.240]   it as
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:50.480]   well
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:50.980]   and
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:51.460]   I'll just
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:51.860]   throw in
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:52.080]   as long
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:52.280]   as we're
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:52.980]   editorializing
[02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:53.200]   a lot
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:53.460]   today
[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:54.540]   I think
[02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:54.720]   in the
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.140]   last five
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:55.400]   years
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:56.440]   the discourse
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:57.180]   around public
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:57.540]   health
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:10:58.360]   from the

[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:00.760]   side
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:01.280]   from the

[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:02.000]   side
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:02.260]   from the
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:02.420]   launch
[02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:02.680]   has
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:03.600]   really
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:04.220]   transformed
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:04.600]   in no

[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:04.980]   part
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:05.480]   thanks to
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:06.360]   social media
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:06.900]   and podcasts
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:07.480]   so
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:08.860]   things are
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:09.280]   evolving
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:10.020]   thank you
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:10.300]   Dr.
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:10.580]   Huber
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:11.240]   oh well
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:11.900]   and thank
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:12.180]   you
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:12.900]   and thank
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:13.160]   you
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.280]   vitamin
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:15.000]   deficiencies
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000]   and
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:16.900]   mental
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:17.280]   health
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.280]   it almost
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:18.800]   sounds like
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:19.220]   we're headed
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.320]   deeper into
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:20.880]   supplements
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:21.480]   and we
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:21.880]   might touch
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.320]   on that
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.160]   but a few
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:23.520]   years ago
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:23.900]   I went to
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:24.360]   a McKnight
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:24.940]   meeting
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:26.060]   and somebody
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:26.900]   presented some
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:27.960]   proteomics data
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:28.360]   where they were
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:28.800]   sequencing
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:30.040]   spinal fluid
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:30.960]   from depressed
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.460]   patients
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:32.040]   and finding
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.020]   that certain
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:33.400]   depressed
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:34.040]   patients
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:35.160]   had deficiencies
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:35.680]   in certain
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:36.140]   vitamins
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:36.520]   that could
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:37.220]   easily be
[02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:37.600]   replaced
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:37.840]   through
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.600]   supplementation
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:38.980]   and
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:39.900]   lo and behold
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:40.980]   their depressions
[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:41.220]   were
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:41.760]   in these
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:42.100]   particular
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:42.460]   patients
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:42.760]   were being
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:43.140]   cured
[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:44.020]   literally
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:44.820]   reversed
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:45.540]   going into
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:45.980]   remission
[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:46.880]   by virtue
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:47.220]   of taking
[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:47.400]   the
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:47.900]   appropriate
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:49.000]   vitamins
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:49.340]   but the
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:49.760]   issue
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:50.180]   was
[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:50.820]   they
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:51.040]   had to
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:51.160]   use
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:51.480]   spinal
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:51.840]   tabs
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:52.240]   so it
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:52.780]   was not
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:53.320]   in order
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:53.660]   to know
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:54.040]   what
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:54.840]   these
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:55.240]   patients
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:55.580]   needed
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:55.880]   but it
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:55.980]   was
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:56.320]   really
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:56.820]   striking
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:58.080]   goodness
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:58.440]   we're
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:58.600]   talking
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:58.780]   about
[02:11:58.780 --> 02:11:59.320]   B vitamins
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:11:59.640]   and
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.000]   depression
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:00.680]   so
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:01.560]   could
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:01.640]   you
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:01.920]   tell us
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:02.200]   about
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:02.760]   B12
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:03.080]   and other
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:03.620]   B vitamins
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.360]   and
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:06.040]   methylation
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:06.640]   and folate
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:06.940]   there's a
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:07.400]   little cluster
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:08.160]   of topics
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:08.360]   here
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:08.580]   that I
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:08.700]   think
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:08.860]   is
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:09.240]   super
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:09.680]   interesting
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:09.960]   and that
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:10.180]   people
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:10.520]   really
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:10.740]   should
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:10.940]   know
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:11.480]   about
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:11.920]   vis-a-vis
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:12.360]   depression
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:13.080]   and other
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:13.540]   CNS
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:14.220]   challenges
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:14.800]   before I
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.240]   get into
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:15.640]   the
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:16.640]   complex
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:17.900]   part of
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:18.060]   the
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:18.520]   story
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:18.920]   let me
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:19.120]   just
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:19.360]   start
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:19.540]   with
[02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:20.100]   basics
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:20.560]   so
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:21.480]   and this
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:21.880]   relates
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:22.440]   to
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:23.420]   nutrition
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:24.120]   that
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.500]   a lot
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:25.900]   of these
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:27.000]   basic
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:27.640]   vitamins
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:28.820]   and minerals
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:30.660]   like
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:31.000]   vitamin
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:31.780]   B12
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:32.740]   folate
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:34.280]   and iron
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:35.080]   I'll just
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:35.780]   stop there
[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:36.300]   B12
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:36.680]   folate
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.240]   and iron
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:37.880]   these
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.240]   are all
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:38.740]   essential
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:39.320]   to
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:40.000]   mitochondrial
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:40.460]   function
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.500]   they play
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:41.820]   a role
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.680]   in numerous
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:43.920]   enzymes
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:44.520]   and other

[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:45.620]   reactions
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:46.320]   outside of
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.000]   mitochondria
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:47.600]   but they
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.040]   are all
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:48.460]   central
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:48.800]   to
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:49.460]   mitochondrial
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:50.320]   function
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:50.780]   and so
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:51.160]   if you
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.660]   are deficient
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:53.080]   in these
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:53.560]   vitamins
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.100]   your
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:54.860]   mitochondria
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:55.300]   will not
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:55.660]   function
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:56.120]   properly
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:56.480]   so it's
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:56.800]   at least
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:57.200]   it doesn't
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:57.840]   prove
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:58.040]   the

[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:00.760]   disorders
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:01.560]   but it's
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:02.160]   consistent
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:02.640]   with
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:02.960]   the

[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:05.900]   and
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:08.000]   the reality
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:08.840]   is a lot
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:09.160]   of
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:09.600]   Americans
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:10.060]   are
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:12.220]   you know
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.040]   a lot
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:13.580]   of different
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:14.600]   populations
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:15.320]   within
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:15.780]   America
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:17.060]   and then
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:17.320]   certainly
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:17.760]   in other
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.280]   countries
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:18.960]   can be
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:19.560]   highly
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:20.060]   deficient
[02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:20.480]   in some

[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.080]   so
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.680]   iron
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:26.360]   you know
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:26.640]   there's
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:27.080]   a study
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:27.840]   in JAMA
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:28.500]   just last

[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:04.880]   but the

[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:07.260]   that the

[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:17.880]   has been
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:18.420]   focused
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:19.560]   it's
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:19.960]   trying to
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:20.520]   understand
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:20.960]   this
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:21.640]   trying to
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:22.080]   understand
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:23.180]   what is
[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:23.600]   happening
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:23.920]   with

[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:25.780]   how does
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:26.480]   that impact

[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:29.400]   we know
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:29.800]   that
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:31.680]   so now
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:32.140]   back to
[02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:32.640]   the question
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:33.000]   that you
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:33.640]   posed
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:34.660]   is there
[02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:35.200]   any
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:36.520]   possibility
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:37.680]   that vaccines
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:38.480]   could contribute
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:39.060]   to that

[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:46.360]   I think
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:46.780]   the answer
[02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:47.140]   to that
[02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:47.820]   is yes
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:49.920]   is there
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:50.620]   variation
[02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:51.300]   in the

[02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:55.980]   the answer

[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:39.440]   there's

[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:39.940]   one

[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:45.160]   who
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:46.060]   already
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:46.540]   had an

[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:50.560]   it was
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:50.900]   already
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:51.340]   known
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:52.680]   she got
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:53.520]   vaccines
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:55.520]   and I think
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.180]   within days
[02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:56.740]   or weeks
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.240]   of getting

[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:06.380]   that case
[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:07.860]   won a

[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:11.000]   that went
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:11.500]   to court
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:12.020]   it was
[02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:12.700]   tried in
[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:13.040]   court
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:14.260]   and she
[02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:14.780]   won
[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:15.640]   and the
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:16.580]   court ruled
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:17.200]   that the

[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:18.600]   did in
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:18.940]   fact
[02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:19.540]   contribute
[02:37:19.540 --> 02:37:20.660]   to this
[02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:21.460]   girl's

[02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:23.060]   condition
[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:25.020]   now they
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:25.700]   assumed it
[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:26.100]   was because
[02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:26.520]   she had a
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:27.160]   pre-existing

[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:28.460]   disorder
[02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:30.460]   and I
[02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:31.120]   would support
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:31.620]   that it
[02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:32.460]   lines up
[02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:32.920]   perfectly
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:34.080]   with what
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:34.540]   I've been
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:35.500]   talking about
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:36.420]   all along
[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:38.220]   that people
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:38.780]   who have
[02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:39.920]   vulnerabilities
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:41.180]   with mitochondria

[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:43.980]   you can only
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:44.700]   absorb so
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:45.440]   many hits
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:46.620]   and when
[02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:47.140]   you get
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:47.960]   that final
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:48.400]   hit
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:49.480]   that tips
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:50.180]   kind of
[02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:51.160]   the balance
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:52.880]   to impact
[02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:53.720]   neurodevelopment
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:54.420]   you can get
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:54.820]   that
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:37:56.520]   when
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:57.300]   now
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:58.300]   coming back

[02:37:59.120 --> 02:37:59.960]   question
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:00.360]   so should
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:00.880]   people get
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:01.340]   vaccinated
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:02.080]   or not
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:03.980]   we do
[02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:04.420]   have
[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:05.780]   reasonably
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:06.140]   good

[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.480]   people
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.120]   are more
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:12.680]   likely
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:14.300]   to develop

[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:17.440]   right
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:18.360]   the problem
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:18.820]   with that
[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:19.300]   study
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:19.780]   is that

[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:33.100]   is that
[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:33.260]   the
[02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:33.700]   researchers
[02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:34.340]   decide
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:34.780]   what they
[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:35.200]   control
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:35.480]   for
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:35.780]   and what
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:35.920]   they
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:36.180]   don't
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:36.560]   control
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:36.880]   for
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:39.040]   but the
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:39.580]   existing
[02:38:39.580 --> 02:38:40.220]   research
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:40.540]   right
[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:40.840]   now
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:41.240]   as
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:41.820]   published
[02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:42.060]   and
[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:42.500]   as
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:43.200]   designed
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:46.040]   suggests
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:46.920]   that
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:48.800]   if you
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:49.220]   don't
[02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:49.520]   get a
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:49.900]   vaccine
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:50.240]   you're
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:50.520]   more
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:50.840]   likely
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:51.020]   to
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:51.280]   develop
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:51.720]   autism
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:51.960]   than
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:52.220]   if you
[02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:52.420]   do
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:52.780]   get a
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:53.300]   vaccine
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:54.480]   and how
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:54.760]   would I
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:55.120]   understand
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:55.560]   that
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:56.260]   I just
[02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:56.740]   talked
[02:38:56.740 --> 02:38:56.920]   about
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:57.860]   infections
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:38:58.680]   themselves
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:38:59.580]   can cause
[02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:00.500]   neurodevelopmental
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:01.260]   disorders
[02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:02.620]   so if
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:03.100]   a child
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:03.440]   gets
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:04.160]   measles
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.580]   they're
[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:06.980]   not only
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:07.360]   at risk
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:07.800]   of dying
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:07.980]   of
[02:39:07.980 --> 02:39:08.400]   measles
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:08.660]   they're
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:08.980]   also
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:09.540]   at risk
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:09.980]   of
[02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:10.760]   impacting
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:11.040]   their
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:11.680]   mitochondrial
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:12.100]   function
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:12.740]   and developing
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:13.760]   a neurodevelopmental
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:14.220]   disorder
[02:39:14.220 --> 02:39:14.880]   as a result
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:15.540]   of getting
[02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:16.160]   a severe
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:16.820]   infection
[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:17.400]   assuming
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:17.680]   there's
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:18.020]   choice
[02:39:18.020 --> 02:39:18.600]   there's
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:18.900]   a risk
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:19.260]   benefit
[02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:19.720]   analysis
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:20.180]   do you
[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:20.600]   want
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:21.420]   the
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:23.600]   potential
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:24.440]   inflammation
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:24.900]   from the
[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:25.340]   vaccine
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:25.920]   or lack
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:26.040]   of
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:26.700]   you
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:27.540]   run the
[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:27.820]   gamble
[02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:28.280]   it's hard
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:28.680]   to predict
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:28.920]   who's
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:29.260]   going to have
[02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:29.640]   a big
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:30.020]   inflammatory
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:30.680]   response
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:31.100]   and who's
[02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:31.440]   not
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:32.140]   although
[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:33.200]   I'm
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:33.420]   thinking
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:33.640]   in the
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:33.800]   back
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:33.880]   of
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:34.000]   my
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:34.220]   mind
[02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:34.360]   about
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:34.540]   these
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:35.000]   lifestyle
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:35.440]   factors
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:35.660]   even
[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:35.860]   though
[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:36.040]   it's
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:36.400]   a young
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:36.860]   child
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:37.160]   or
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:38.480]   an
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:38.940]   adolescent
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:39.340]   in some
[02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:39.660]   cases
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:40.000]   but
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:40.520]   young
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:40.880]   children
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:41.320]   typically
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.280]   there are
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:42.460]   things
[02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:42.660]   that you
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:43.020]   can do
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:43.820]   to bolster
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:44.320]   the
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.600]   health
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:46.940]   of that
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.120]   kid
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:47.400]   going
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:47.820]   into
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:48.220]   a
[02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:48.580]   vaccine
[02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:48.780]   if
[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:49.040]   you're
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:49.300]   choosing
[02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:49.460]   to
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:49.860]   vaccinate
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:50.040]   your
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:50.240]   kids
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:50.420]   right
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:50.620]   like
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:50.960]   proper
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:51.280]   sleep
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:51.600]   proper
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:52.120]   nutrition
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:52.620]   proper
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:53.420]   everything
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:53.740]   you
[02:39:53.740 --> 02:39:53.940]   wouldn't
[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:54.160]   want
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:54.380]   them
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:54.900]   even
[02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:55.260]   slightly
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:55.640]   sleep
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.020]   deprived
[02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:56.340]   because
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:56.660]   that
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:39:56.900]   would
[02:39:56.900 --> 02:39:58.100]   increase
[02:39:58.100 --> 02:39:58.300]   the
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:39:58.500]   risk
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:39:58.700]   of
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:39:59.340]   inflammation
[02:39:59.340 --> 02:39:59.680]   right
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:39:59.840]   I mean
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:39:59.980]   these
[02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:00.160]   things
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:00.760]   compound
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:01.500]   as I
[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:01.860]   understand
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:02.240]   it
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:03.780]   so
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:05.560]   you know
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:06.480]   I think
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:06.960]   what most
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:07.540]   all parents
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:08.160]   really want
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:08.700]   is a sense
[02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:09.280]   of control
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:09.620]   over
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:10.640]   what are
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:11.320]   inevitably
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:11.980]   a mixture
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:12.200]   of
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:13.200]   controllable
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.020]   and uncontrollable
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:14.540]   factors
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:15.180]   and this
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:15.440]   is what
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:15.760]   I hear
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:16.120]   when I
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:16.900]   really
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:17.280]   listen
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:17.760]   to this
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.060]   debate
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:18.280]   about
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:18.820]   vaccines
[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:19.580]   I hear
[02:40:19.580 --> 02:40:20.420]   my
[02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:20.740]   science
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:21.280]   colleagues
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:22.420]   inevitably
[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:22.940]   saying
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:23.720]   okay
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:23.900]   the
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:24.300]   Wakefield
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:24.660]   data
[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:24.920]   were

[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:25.720]   etc
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:26.080]   like
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:26.440]   no
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:26.700]   no
[02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:26.980]   no
[02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:27.200]   there's

[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:28.000]   and
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:28.260]   then I
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:28.440]   hear
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:29.260]   parents
[02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:30.000]   who

[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:31.680]   kids
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:31.820]   are
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:32.000]   due
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:32.180]   for

[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:07.900]   soon
[02:47:07.900 --> 02:47:08.260]   to be
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:08.580]   a
[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:09.420]   exploration
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:10.620]   a

[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:12.020]   of the

[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:14.000]   I read
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:14.160]   this
[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:14.540]   someplace

[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:17.620]   think
[02:47:17.620 --> 02:47:17.840]   that's
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:17.940]   the

[02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:18.340]   I
[02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:18.460]   think

[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:22.380]   this
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:22.540]   because
[02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:22.680]   they
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:22.840]   felt
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:23.000]   like

[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:24.560]   and
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:24.720]   then
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:24.980]   others
[02:47:24.980 --> 02:47:25.120]   are

[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:28.440]   you
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:28.680]   don't
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:28.820]   think
[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:29.020]   there's

[02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:34.880]   I
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:35.020]   think
[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:35.340]   everyone's
[02:47:35.340 --> 02:47:35.520]   just

[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:39.100]   I
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:39.360]   think
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:39.560]   more
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:39.780]   data

[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:40.140]   always
[02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:40.480]   great

[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:08.220]   of space
[02:55:08.220 --> 02:55:09.620]   so I
[02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:09.780]   think
[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:10.320]   you know
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:12.860]   it's not
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:13.100]   always
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:13.580]   and low
[02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:14.200]   HDL
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:15.640]   so sometimes
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:16.560]   you know
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:17.000]   we're shocked
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:17.380]   to see
[02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:17.600]   like
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:17.760]   oh
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.300]   this person
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:18.900]   is like
[02:55:18.900 --> 02:55:19.520]   apparently
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:19.920]   healthy
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:20.540]   but has
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:21.140]   you know
[02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:21.960]   low HDL
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:22.340]   and has
[02:55:22.340 --> 02:55:22.860]   got their
[02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:23.260]   ApoB
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:23.600]   is through
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:24.040]   the roof
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:24.620]   and they're
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:25.360]   they're not
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:25.720]   well
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:26.800]   but just
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:27.200]   because they're
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:28.520]   not obese
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:29.200]   doesn't mean
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:29.880]   they're metabolically
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:30.200]   healthy
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:30.640]   correct
[02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:31.420]   that is
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:32.240]   absolutely
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:32.820]   correct
[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:33.640]   and I go
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:34.220]   back to
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:35.200]   some of our
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:35.420]   prior
[02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:36.080]   conversation
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:36.860]   so
[02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:38.880]   a 14 year
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:39.340]   old girl
[02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:39.900]   who
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:42.100]   is severely
[02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:43.080]   iron deficient
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:45.500]   is metabolically
[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:45.960]   unhealthy
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:47.420]   why
[02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:48.340]   because her
[02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:48.940]   mitochondria
[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:49.280]   can't
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:49.560]   function
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:50.020]   properly
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:50.540]   without
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:50.960]   iron
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:52.340]   she can
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:53.000]   be thin
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.720]   she can
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:56.860]   otherwise
[02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:57.900]   look like
[02:55:57.900 --> 02:55:58.520]   a healthy
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:55:59.160]   attractive
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:00.680]   girl
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:02.180]   but
[02:56:02.180 --> 02:56:02.960]   she can
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:03.160]   be
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:04.000]   metabolically
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:04.840]   unhealthy
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:05.420]   because she
[02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:05.860]   doesn't
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:06.280]   have
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:06.900]   all of the
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:07.380]   essential
[02:56:07.380 --> 02:56:07.900]   vitamins
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:08.540]   and nutrients
[02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:08.900]   that she
[02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:09.460]   needs
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:10.780]   to have
[02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:11.440]   properly
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:12.100]   functioning
[02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:12.920]   mitochondria
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:13.700]   and metabolism
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:15.080]   and
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:16.360]   why would
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:17.120]   that matter
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:17.900]   it matters
[02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:18.620]   because she
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:19.520]   might develop
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:20.560]   an anxiety
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:21.240]   disorder
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:22.100]   or she
[02:56:22.100 --> 02:56:22.800]   might develop
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:23.340]   depression
[02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:24.460]   or she
[02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:25.140]   might develop
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:25.740]   symptoms of
[02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:26.200]   an eating
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:26.820]   disorder
[02:56:26.820 --> 02:56:28.280]   and then
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:28.660]   we're all
[02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:29.300]   scratching our
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:29.540]   heads
[02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:30.040]   giving those
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:30.440]   labels
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:31.000]   oh you've
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:31.260]   got
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:31.700]   depression
[02:56:31.700 --> 02:56:31.980]   you've
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:32.140]   got
[02:56:32.140 --> 02:56:32.560]   anxiety
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:33.260]   you need
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:34.160]   Prozac
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:35.340]   and maybe
[02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:35.860]   she really
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:36.120]   needs
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:36.620]   iron
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:38.280]   right
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:38.780]   I mean
[02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:39.440]   what I
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:39.960]   realized
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:40.560]   and this
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:40.960]   was really
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:41.280]   where I
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:41.780]   wanted to
[02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:42.860]   bring us
[02:56:42.860 --> 02:56:43.160]   to
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:45.880]   is a
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:46.260]   question
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:46.800]   for you
[02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:47.200]   I have
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:47.660]   an idea
[02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:47.960]   but
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:48.980]   let's also
[02:56:48.980 --> 02:56:49.480]   pose the
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:49.760]   question
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:50.060]   as an
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:50.300]   idea
[02:56:50.300 --> 02:56:50.660]   and feel
[02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:51.000]   free to
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:51.320]   bat it
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:51.600]   down
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:52.660]   I'm
[02:56:52.660 --> 02:56:52.940]   beginning
[02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:53.380]   to think
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:53.800]   that in
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:54.160]   order to
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:54.540]   get out
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:54.900]   of this
[02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:55.380]   health
[02:56:55.380 --> 02:56:55.700]   rut
[02:56:55.700 --> 02:56:56.100]   that we're
[02:56:56.100 --> 02:56:56.320]   in
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:57.200]   that clearly
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:58.080]   relates to
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:56:58.860]   mitochondrial
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:56:59.340]   dysfunction
[02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:01.100]   and at the
[02:57:01.100 --> 02:57:01.500]   same time
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:02.040]   there are
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:02.720]   tools
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:03.640]   the lifestyle
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:04.260]   tools that
[02:57:04.260 --> 02:57:04.840]   you described
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:05.200]   there
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:05.840]   yes there
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:06.320]   are supplements
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:06.900]   and maybe
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:07.420]   methylene
[02:57:07.420 --> 02:57:08.260]   blue will be
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:09.400]   advantageous
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:09.740]   and
[02:57:09.740 --> 02:57:11.100]   methylate B12
[02:57:11.100 --> 02:57:11.720]   perhaps but
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:12.180]   certainly the
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:12.480]   lifestyle
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:13.040]   factors
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:14.640]   most people
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:15.800]   again when
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:16.260]   they hear
[02:57:16.260 --> 02:57:16.780]   metabolic
[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:17.280]   health
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:17.640]   they just
[02:57:17.640 --> 02:57:17.860]   think
[02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:18.160]   okay
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:18.760]   metabolism
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:19.420]   obesity
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:20.040]   thinness
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:20.780]   or fatness
[02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:21.800]   and it sort
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:22.280]   of becomes
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:23.200]   a gravitational
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:23.880]   pull towards
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:24.200]   that
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:25.460]   do you think
[02:57:25.460 --> 02:57:26.080]   it's possible
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:26.620]   to create
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:27.260]   a metric
[02:57:27.260 --> 02:57:28.600]   I don't want
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:29.160]   to say BMI
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:29.960]   as an example
[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:30.460]   because that's
[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:31.260]   controversial for
[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:31.700]   some people
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:33.340]   but is it
[02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:34.120]   possible to
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:34.880]   create a metric
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:36.360]   of all around
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:37.240]   metabolic health
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:38.200]   that would be
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:39.180]   incentivized so
[02:57:39.180 --> 02:57:40.360]   that people
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:40.920]   can live better
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:41.320]   lives
[02:57:41.320 --> 02:57:41.580]   their
[02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:41.880]   offspring
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:42.300]   can be
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:42.580]   healthier
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:43.160]   as well
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:43.900]   and we
[02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:44.920]   can unburden
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:45.260]   the health
[02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:45.840]   care system
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:46.740]   and potentially
[02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:48.220]   avoid millions
[02:57:48.220 --> 02:57:48.600]   and millions
[02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:48.960]   of people
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:49.520]   having these
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:50.120]   so-called
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:50.820]   incurable
[02:57:50.820 --> 02:57:51.960]   mental health
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:52.500]   disorders
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:53.360]   in air
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:53.760]   quotes
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:55.180]   you know
[02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:55.480]   what you're
[02:57:55.480 --> 02:57:55.940]   describing
[02:57:55.940 --> 02:57:56.440]   is kind
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:57:56.600]   of
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:57.560]   in my
[02:57:57.560 --> 02:57:57.900]   mind
[02:57:57.900 --> 02:58:00.500]   a really
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:01.200]   important
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:02.680]   next step
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:04.240]   and the
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:04.720]   great news
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:05.300]   is that there
[02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:06.280]   are several
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:07.100]   research groups
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:07.660]   that I know
[02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:08.660]   of that are
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:09.240]   working on
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:10.100]   exactly that
[02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:11.460]   one is a
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:11.860]   commercial
[02:58:11.860 --> 02:58:12.540]   company
[02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:13.340]   I'm not going
[02:58:13.340 --> 02:58:13.800]   to name any
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:14.460]   names but
[02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:14.940]   one is a
[02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:15.200]   commercial
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:15.940]   company that
[02:58:15.940 --> 02:58:16.720]   has a
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:19.500]   product of
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:20.620]   a series of
[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:21.280]   biomarkers
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:22.320]   blood biomarkers
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:22.720]   that they
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:23.200]   believe
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:24.920]   represent
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:25.520]   ultimately
[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:26.200]   mitochondrial
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:26.800]   dysfunction
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:27.960]   all of the
[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:28.680]   different cellular
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:29.500]   pathways that
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:30.320]   can result in
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:30.800]   mitochondrial
[02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:31.240]   dysfunction
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:32.580]   and or can
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:33.180]   reflect
[02:58:33.180 --> 02:58:33.940]   mitochondrial
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:34.460]   dysfunction
[02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:36.400]   and they
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:37.160]   believe that
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:38.120]   their test
[02:58:38.120 --> 02:58:39.900]   might be able
[02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:40.480]   to predict
[02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:41.200]   the development
[02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:41.820]   of autism
[02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:43.560]   that every
[02:58:43.560 --> 02:58:44.320]   child at age
[02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:44.860]   one should
[02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:45.280]   get this
[02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:46.320]   blood biomarker
[02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:47.520]   and it will
[02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:48.420]   tell us who's
[02:58:48.420 --> 02:58:49.160]   at high risk
[02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:50.100]   developing a
[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:50.740]   neurodevelopmental
[02:58:50.740 --> 02:58:51.240]   disorder
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:52.960]   the test
[02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:53.840]   itself doesn't
[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:54.460]   tell us what's
[02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:55.220]   wrong it just
[02:58:55.220 --> 02:58:56.140]   tells us something's
[02:58:56.140 --> 02:58:57.440]   wrong and then
[02:58:57.440 --> 02:58:58.880]   the clinicians need
[02:58:58.880 --> 02:58:59.700]   to go to work and
[02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:00.300]   try to figure out
[02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:01.440]   what is going on
[02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:02.460]   what is causing
[02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:03.780]   this metabolic
[02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:04.740]   mitochondrial
[02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:05.700]   dysregulation
[02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:07.500]   so that we could
[02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:08.520]   potentially intervene
[02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:09.820]   I've talked with one
[02:59:09.820 --> 02:59:10.560]   of the leading
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:11.280]   mitochondrial
[02:59:11.280 --> 02:59:12.180]   researchers really
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:12.820]   in the world
[02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:14.140]   he's got a set
[02:59:14.140 --> 02:59:15.760]   of 20 biomarkers
[02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:17.560]   that he believes
[02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:19.140]   represent mitochondrial
[02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:20.160]   dysfunction broadly
[02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:21.220]   and then there's
[02:59:21.220 --> 02:59:22.060]   another research
[02:59:22.060 --> 02:59:23.820]   group that
[02:59:23.820 --> 02:59:25.720]   has actually
[02:59:25.720 --> 02:59:26.720]   narrowed it down
[02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:27.640]   to just five
[02:59:27.640 --> 02:59:28.960]   different biomarkers
[02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:29.700]   in men
[02:59:29.700 --> 02:59:31.260]   and five
[02:59:31.260 --> 02:59:32.440]   slightly different
[02:59:32.440 --> 02:59:32.960]   there's some
[02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:33.580]   overlap but
[02:59:33.580 --> 02:59:34.260]   slight differences
[02:59:34.260 --> 02:59:35.500]   in women
[02:59:35.500 --> 02:59:37.200]   and those
[02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:38.580]   five biomarkers
[02:59:38.580 --> 02:59:39.420]   alone were
[02:59:39.420 --> 02:59:40.160]   able to
[02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:40.820]   distinguish
[02:59:40.820 --> 02:59:41.720]   people with
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:42.740]   chronic severe
[02:59:42.740 --> 02:59:43.840]   suicidal depression
[02:59:43.840 --> 02:59:44.600]   from healthy
[02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:45.140]   controls
[02:59:45.140 --> 02:59:46.160]   with over
[02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:47.120]   90%
[02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:47.760]   sensitivity
[02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:48.900]   and specificity
[02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:50.700]   so I think
[02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:51.360]   that is
[02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:51.940]   one of the
[02:59:51.940 --> 02:59:52.520]   directions we
[02:59:52.520 --> 02:59:53.180]   need to go
[02:59:53.180 --> 02:59:53.940]   is we need
[02:59:53.940 --> 02:59:55.520]   to establish
[02:59:55.520 --> 02:59:56.280]   tests
[02:59:56.280 --> 02:59:57.620]   with all of
[02:59:57.620 --> 02:59:58.060]   these groups
[02:59:58.060 --> 02:59:58.480]   I want to
[02:59:58.480 --> 02:59:59.400]   just state
[02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:00.380]   clearly and
[03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:00.700]   plainly
[03:00:00.700 --> 03:00:00.980]   because one
[03:00:00.980 --> 03:00:01.360]   of the common
[03:00:01.360 --> 03:00:01.980]   questions I get
[03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:02.780]   is what's
[03:00:02.780 --> 03:00:03.460]   the blood test
[03:00:03.460 --> 03:00:04.020]   I can get
[03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:04.400]   for my
[03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:05.020]   mitochondrial
[03:00:05.020 --> 03:00:05.400]   health
[03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:06.420]   there isn't
[03:00:06.420 --> 03:00:06.680]   one
[03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:07.800]   that's the
[03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:08.000]   answer
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:08.440]   there is
[03:00:08.440 --> 03:00:09.020]   not one
[03:00:09.020 --> 03:00:10.380]   there are
[03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:12.100]   lots of
[03:00:12.100 --> 03:00:13.260]   different biomarkers
[03:00:13.260 --> 03:00:14.280]   that can
[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:14.860]   suggest
[03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:15.900]   dysregulation
[03:00:15.900 --> 03:00:16.700]   of metabolism
[03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:17.520]   and mitochondrial
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:18.060]   function
[03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:19.280]   and again
[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:19.840]   these three
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:20.480]   research groups
[03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:20.820]   are all
[03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:21.420]   working on
[03:00:21.420 --> 03:00:21.640]   it
[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:22.800]   in order to
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:23.260]   get those
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:24.440]   five biomarkers
[03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:24.820]   for men
[03:00:24.820 --> 03:00:25.180]   and women
[03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:25.760]   I think
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:26.180]   they measured
[03:00:26.180 --> 03:00:27.180]   400 different
[03:00:27.180 --> 03:00:28.040]   biomarkers
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:29.480]   so we need
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:29.980]   to make sure
[03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:30.740]   that gets
[03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:31.400]   replicated
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:32.300]   that it's
[03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:33.540]   prospectively
[03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:33.980]   it can
[03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:34.400]   identify
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:34.960]   people
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:38.060]   I'm
[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:39.340]   less
[03:00:39.340 --> 03:00:39.980]   concerned
[03:00:39.980 --> 03:00:40.580]   about
[03:00:40.580 --> 03:00:41.320]   kind of
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:41.480]   the
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:42.400]   incentivizing
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:42.880]   and let's
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:43.480]   give insurance
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:44.040]   discounts
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:44.560]   and other
[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:44.940]   things
[03:00:44.940 --> 03:00:45.560]   I actually
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:45.860]   think
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:46.860]   the majority
[03:00:46.860 --> 03:00:47.400]   of human
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:47.720]   beings
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:48.020]   that I
[03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:48.340]   know
[03:00:48.340 --> 03:00:49.160]   authentically
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:49.740]   want to
[03:00:49.740 --> 03:00:50.680]   be healthy
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:52.240]   and they
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:53.020]   authentically
[03:00:53.020 --> 03:00:53.940]   they really
[03:00:53.940 --> 03:00:54.500]   want to have
[03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:54.820]   healthy
[03:00:54.820 --> 03:00:55.220]   children
[03:00:55.220 --> 03:00:57.480]   they will
[03:00:57.480 --> 03:00:58.060]   do anything
[03:00:58.060 --> 03:00:58.420]   to have
[03:00:58.420 --> 03:00:58.720]   healthy
[03:00:58.720 --> 03:00:59.100]   children
[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:00.900]   so I
[03:01:00.900 --> 03:01:01.260]   don't think
[03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:01.640]   we need
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:02.020]   necessarily
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:02.480]   need to
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:02.840]   come up
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:03.580]   with some
[03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:05.060]   incentives
[03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:06.320]   right now
[03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:07.100]   I think
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:07.380]   if we
[03:01:07.380 --> 03:01:07.920]   develop
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:09.660]   evidence-based
[03:01:09.660 --> 03:01:10.240]   tools
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:12.060]   that
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:12.660]   prospective
[03:01:12.660 --> 03:01:13.220]   parents
[03:01:13.220 --> 03:01:14.040]   can use
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:16.020]   to assess
[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:16.900]   their own

[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:24.120]   assess

[03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:31.460]   we pair

[03:01:38.580 --> 03:01:39.220]   improve

[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:41.660]   I mean
[03:01:41.660 --> 03:01:41.940]   that's
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:42.300]   the holy

[03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:44.640]   what I
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:45.220]   just said
[03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:45.660]   probably
[03:01:45.660 --> 03:01:46.280]   represents
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:46.760]   decades
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:46.980]   of

[03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:49.320]   the sooner
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:49.580]   we get
[03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:49.860]   started
[03:01:49.860 --> 03:01:50.320]   the better
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:51.800]   and some
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:52.080]   of it's
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:52.360]   already
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:52.760]   underway
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:53.160]   as I've
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:53.440]   mentioned
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:53.960]   so it's
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:54.260]   not like
[03:01:54.260 --> 03:01:54.740]   we start
[03:01:54.740 --> 03:01:55.180]   from ground
[03:01:55.180 --> 03:01:55.440]   zero
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:56.220]   people have
[03:01:56.220 --> 03:01:56.640]   been on
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:01:57.100]   this trail

[03:01:57.740 --> 03:01:59.520]   so
[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:01.240]   but it
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:01.580]   is going
[03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:02.240]   to require

[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:05.240]   it's going
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:05.800]   to require
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:06.840]   massive

[03:02:11.380 --> 03:02:13.280]   we have a

[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:14.740]   that is
[03:02:14.740 --> 03:02:15.560]   talking about
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:16.760]   massive

[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:19.080]   done
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:21.540]   they're talking
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:22.140]   about massive
[03:02:22.140 --> 03:02:22.820]   changes at

[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:25.040]   I'm really
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:25.560]   hoping and
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:25.980]   praying that
[03:02:25.980 --> 03:02:26.240]   we're going
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:26.640]   to see
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:27.380]   that type
[03:02:27.380 --> 03:02:28.140]   of research
[03:02:28.140 --> 03:02:29.420]   as opposed
[03:02:29.420 --> 03:02:30.060]   to the

[03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:32.100]   which focuses
[03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:32.520]   on
[03:02:32.520 --> 03:02:33.200]   here's
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:33.340]   your

[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:39.760]   and what
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:40.760]   new pills
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:41.080]   can we
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:41.480]   develop

[03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:44.540]   or how
