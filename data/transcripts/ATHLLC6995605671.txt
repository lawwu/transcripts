[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.060]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.080]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.960]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.240]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here today because I'm talking
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.360]   with one of the most well-traveled people I've ever met, Brandon Presser.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   He's an award-winning travel journalist who's been to 130 countries.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   He's written over 50 guidebooks.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.640]   He regularly contributes to CondÃ© Nast Traveler in Bloomberg and hosted the
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.800]   Bravo Television Series Tour Group.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.440]   But most recently he released his latest book, The Far Land, and it is a crazy
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.280]   true story about 200 years of murder, mania, and mutiny in the South Pacific.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.240]   It's definitely worth a read.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   In our conversation, I'm going to try my best to pull out all the
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   travel tips and hacks I can.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.840]   We'll talk about planning a trip, where to stay, having authentic experiences,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.200]   how best to use reviews and guidebooks, why the type of Q-tip a hotel has matters.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.680]   And we'll get his take on the best places you can go for your next trip,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.120]   including a few unexpected ones.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.920]   Brandon has traveled so much.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.560]   I don't know how we're going to get into all of this before we run out of
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320]   time, but I will try my best.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.560]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.880]   Brandon, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.400]   Thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.240]   Yeah, I am really excited for this conversation.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.920]   And I want to jump right in and just ask, what do you think most people
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.880]   get wrong about the way they travel?
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.400]   Man, big question.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.200]   Over the last 10 years, as we've seen social media really ramp up, we see that
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.240]   everyone can post all their experiences and find experiences to covet on Instagram.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.040]   Travel has become a bit of a performance for a lot of people.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.920]   Look at me in this place.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.400]   And I think that's the biggest pitfall that people make, because if you're
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.560]   seeing travel as a commodity or as you performing in that space, you're not
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.880]   actually engaging in that destination.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.320]   And so if someone were thinking about how to spend an upcoming trip, they were
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.840]   like, "You know what?
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.480]   I'm going to take a week off in the fall."
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.440]   What would you tell them to start doing even before they know where they're
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.600]   going to have the right kind of trip?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.920]   I think the biggest mistake that people make, but when they're about to travel
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.040]   is they pick a place and not a reason.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.360]   So I would start your trip planning by thinking about what you want to get out
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.120]   of that trip and then find a shortlist of destinations and marry that shortlist
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.920]   to the purpose of your travel.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.040]   So I want to go to Italy might end up being a hollow experience because the
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.640]   thing that you actually want to get out of the trip is going to a place where
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.960]   there's not a lot of other tourists or going to a place where you really want
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.280]   to have an experience where you're meeting people, making new friendships
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.120]   that might not happen for you in a one week trip there.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.360]   And if it would, it probably might not happen in the place that you might by
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.000]   default go.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.800]   You're like, "I'm going to go to Rome and meet people."
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.720]   That might not be the easiest spot to kind of blend in.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.640]   Exactly.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.560]   There's nothing wrong with having your bucket list and hearing about a trip
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.440]   that someone else took and wanting to go there too.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   You know, word of mouth is the most powerful tool in travel.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.200]   But if you're just sitting down to say, "I have a week in September and I want
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.400]   to fill it," start with how you want to fill it, not where.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.840]   And do you have some examples of things to kind of inspire people about how they
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   could fill it?
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.760]   Yeah, I would start with something like, is it a trip where you want to expend a
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.360]   lot of energy?
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.040]   Do you want it to be a really active trip?
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.280]   Do you want it to be physically active, socially active?
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.560]   Or are you on super burnout and you need a place where you don't want to talk to
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.400]   other people and you just want to be on a beach, in a cabin, on a mountain, in the
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.880]   desert?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.120]   Think about that first.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.400]   Is this going to be like a big social and physical spend?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.200]   Or is this like a reboot?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.800]   And a trip can be both too.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.120]   Just put the big spend first and put the reboot second so that you come home
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.800]   fresh.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.880]   I like it.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.960]   Why do you love travel?
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.720]   I mean, you've done a ton of traveling, but you haven't hit the whole world, but
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.960]   you're closer than most.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.080]   I'm working my way through.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.200]   I was the kid that would ask my parents for a trip when they were like, "What do
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.240]   you want for your birthday?"
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   I didn't want a toy.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.200]   I wanted a trip.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.080]   And I was a kid who had no attention for reading.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.360]   All I wanted to do was look at atlases.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.560]   I think I've had this very ADD brain for years that finds something super
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.360]   interesting, jumps on it, learns everything there is to know about that
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.600]   thing, and then jumps to the next thing.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.720]   And travel has been the only industry in space that has allowed me to let my ADD
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.280]   free.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.240]   I'm obsessed with learning things about different cultures.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.920]   I think through travel, you ultimately learn a lot more about yourself.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.600]   And so for me, it's about seeing the world in an ordinary way.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.880]   I want to go to places and see what the everyday life is for someone there.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.040]   I don't need to check off the Taj Mahal or the Sydney Opera House off of a list.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.680]   I just want to see how other people are experiencing the world, how other
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.520]   people's minds work, what motivates people, what are people's hopes and
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.840]   dreams, what do we have in common, and what are our differences?
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.000]   So that seems like a great goal.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.520]   And I feel like the more you travel in general, the more you're able to
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.480]   appreciate that.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.280]   How would you go about making a meaningful itinerary for a trip?
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.440]   We've come so far away from checklist travel, especially in the American media.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.280]   It's like, "Oh, don't go to the Louvre.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.400]   Don't go to the Taj Mahal."
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   It's okay if you want to see them.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.520]   Go see them and have a look if that's part of your motivation.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.040]   But I think what you need to be thinking about as well is that it's okay not to
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.640]   have everything figured out and not have everything structured.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.880]   I've talked to people who've not been to destinations that they're about to go
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.480]   to, and they're really excited for the trip because at 8 a.m.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   they're doing this, and at 9 a.m.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.160]   they're doing that, 10 a.m.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.240]   they have this planned, 11 a.m.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.120]   they have this planned, and it's this whole list of checklist travel in a
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.720]   different way.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.520]   We think of checklist travel as going to see the big ticket, but then people are
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.960]   like, "I have my food experience, and I have my museum experience, and I have it
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.720]   all lined up."
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.400]   And the best thing about travel and the thing that you will talk about to your
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.600]   friends when you get back, I guarantee, is not on that list before you travel.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.400]   It's the moment of serendipity where you're at a restaurant, and you hit it
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.080]   off with the waiter, and you all go somewhere after, and you're in this cool
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.800]   place that you never thought you would be, meeting people that you never thought
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.200]   you would meet, and you connect on Instagram afterwards, and you stay in
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.600]   touch.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:27.200]   You need to let your trip breathe because if you're too planned out, you're not
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.480]   actually piercing the veneer, the tourism veneer.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.720]   Are there any great examples from your many travels of letting that happen and
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.640]   what unfolded?
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:46.840]   Yeah, I was on a surf trip in Northern Norway, and it was a great experience
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.640]   because I got to meet a lot of other people.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.000]   I was traveling by myself, and we were all doing the surf camp together, so it
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.240]   was like instant friends, and then I tacked on a few days in Oslo at the end
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.720]   just on my own, kind of snooping around, and I went to this restaurant, and I was
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.560]   just eating by myself, and I was looking over to these people my age that were
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.000]   sitting next to me, and I just turned to them, and I was like, "What are you guys
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.480]   up to?"
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.440]   They just seemed like a group of fun friends, and they're like, "Oh, we're
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.960]   going to sing karaoke after this."
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.000]   We ended up staying out all night.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.880]   I had a 7 a.m. flight the next morning, and they were like, "Go get your stuff.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.000]   Just leave it at my apartment.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.240]   We're going to go out all night."
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   And we sang karaoke.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.080]   We went to these bars that I didn't even know existed that were open all night
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.400]   long after parties.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.440]   It doesn't always have to be a party either, but it was just such an
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.560]   unexpected experience.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.120]   I had my built-in friends in northern Norway for the surf camp, but yet the
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.880]   people that I stay in touch with are actually these random people I met in a
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.520]   Vietnamese restaurant in Oslo.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.480]   And do you think there's something aside from just leaving space in the
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.240]   itinerary or leaving time open that you can do to help make sure experiences
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.000]   like that have a higher chance of happening?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.600]   I think solo travel, you have a lot of energy pointed outward.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.480]   You're curious.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.440]   You're by yourself.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.360]   You're more open to having someone come up to you and talk to you.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.240]   If you're by yourself on the street, that's usually when someone's like, "Hey,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.480]   I need help with directions to this."
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.920]   Keeping that energy open, I know it sounds a little bit hooey, but that's
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.640]   part of it.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   Also, because we live so much on our phones, it's really jarring to actually
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.960]   go up and talk to someone.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.160]   But it's become jarring in a good way at this point where people are like, "Oh,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.120]   you want to ask me a question?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.680]   Sure."
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.960]   Strike up a conversation.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.920]   I think one of the things that I'm always thinking about is generosity.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.480]   When you go to a destination, you come back with stories where you're like, "Oh,
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.520]   this family, I met them and they invited me into their house."
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   Or you can get these Airbnb experiences of going into people's homes and cooking
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   with them or whatever it is.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.840]   I think if we think about it in the opposite way, how can we be generous to the
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.360]   people that we're visiting?
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.440]   I think that you also garner a lot of goodwill in that regard as well.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.360]   Can you give me an example of being generous while visiting?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.480]   Sure.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   I always pack little gifts for people that I've not yet met.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.600]   It's like a little something from home, like a candy.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.480]   We all have this sentimental feeling about the candy that we grew up with.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.840]   I grew up in Canada and there's candy in Canada that you can't get in the US.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.000]   Candy from where you're from is a really fun thing to exchange with people because
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.760]   it's oddly personal.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.840]   Stuff from where you live, even like a cool postcard.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.080]   I often bring little blank business cards with me.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.720]   And if I meet someone really cool, I'll write them a note and leave my email address.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.400]   And you can control the message that way.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   You can leave them a phone number for WhatsApp if you want to hear from them a lot or
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.120]   Instagram if you want to hear from the West.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.440]   But doing things analog, it shocks the system and it starts inspiring devotion.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.200]   I think back to a trip I took to Syria, where almost everyone seemed to want to invite you
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.160]   into their home.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.880]   I will say my wife and I were traveling together, and so it's not just a solo traveler thing.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.040]   And sometimes people can be a little put at ease by having two people.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.520]   They're like, "Oh, this isn't a random dude on the street.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.080]   It's a couple.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.920]   I can trust them and invite them over."
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.000]   We had all kinds of experiences.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.320]   For some reason, when I was like, "Oh, I guess if I'm paying to go to someone's house, does
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.760]   it feel less authentic?
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.080]   Is it like the commercialized version of it?"
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.440]   How do you think about trying to make those experiences happen naturally versus maybe
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.680]   saving the time and buying the serendipity?
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.200]   Yeah, that's the catch-22, right?
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:44.880]   I've had guides that I've hired to do mountain climbing or to visit a city, and I have struck
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.800]   up genuine friendships with those guides.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.360]   So I suppose it's not that different than hiring someone is essentially what it is to
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.040]   be invited into their house and to cook with them or to learn something from them.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.320]   It's an opportunity to connect with someone.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.120]   It's just a shame that it has to be so transactional.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:12.560]   I don't think that there's necessarily a way to have magic happen or have serendipity happen
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.760]   if you're trying too hard.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.640]   One of the things that I'll try to do that feels like a little bit more unscripted is
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.160]   try to find a run club in a city that I'm going to.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   And usually, those are free.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.400]   Usually, they're on weekends.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.320]   And that's always a good opportunity because at least you have something in common from
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:32.960]   the start.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.080]   You both like to run.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.600]   And then often, you need to refuel after your run.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.960]   So maybe there's an invite with the person, people that you were with to go for brunch
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.320]   after an early morning run.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.280]   I would start there.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:51.520]   I would start with something that feels true to you, a passion point of yours, and bridge
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.280]   a more organic relationship with someone because you share something that you like.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.760]   We were in Sweden.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.560]   And evidently, there's a lot of gamers in Sweden.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.280]   And we walked by a store that had every board game.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.840]   And I couldn't help but think, "My wife and I love board games."
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.760]   We didn't actually have time that day.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.840]   But your example of a run club could be going to some board game night at a board game store
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.600]   or whatever your hobby is.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.960]   I bet there is a group of people that partake in that hobby in most major cities.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.880]   So if you're listening and you don't love running, I'm sure there's another group that
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.400]   you can find of people that might become people to hang out with.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.040]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.360]   It doesn't have to be exercise.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   It doesn't have to be running.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.480]   Past version of me as a fixer used to take different producers, journalists to different
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   countries to show them a few cool things.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.600]   Maybe they wanted to use it as a filming location, or they wanted to scout a photo shoot.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.040]   I took an editor from Vanity Fair once to Iceland.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.000]   And I did just that, except it wasn't running.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.800]   It was knitting.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.160]   And we found a knitting bee.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.600]   And we just hung out with these women knitting for a whole afternoon.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.000]   We baked... Ended up baking cakes with them.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.920]   Find that point in common and start from there.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.080]   I like that.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.800]   Talk a little bit more about being a fixer in Iceland.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.400]   What is that experience like?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.880]   And how would someone who doesn't know anything about a country find the person like you in
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.240]   that country to hire to help show them the ins and outs?
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.760]   I'm guessing you didn't just have a website where you're like, "I'm the Iceland fixer guy.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   Come hire me."
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.440]   I know all that happened word of mouth.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:39.600]   But I worked at Lonely Planet for about 7 full years doing back-to-back guidebooks for them.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.200]   And the thing about Lonely Planet is essentially you just get paid to
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.880]   marinate in a destination for a very extended amount of time.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.280]   And every day, you're going out looking for something new and cool.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:58.400]   And through that, I built a portfolio of destinations where I could consider myself a
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.440]   real expert.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.960]   It wasn't just because I had done one trip there for a month.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.160]   It was because I was clocking years in these places and spending all of my time getting
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.120]   to know all the right people, getting to eat in the right places.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.160]   And through that, I nurtured relationships where people were like, "You're the Iceland.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.760]   We're looking at doing a movie there.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.120]   We want to shoot a TV show there.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.360]   We're looking for a few people, this, that, and the other."
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.240]   And I was like, "Let's go.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.120]   Let's fly over.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.840]   I'll rent a car.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.360]   I'll drive you to all the places you need."
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   And that's how it happened.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.040]   I'm just thinking of a practical way to apply this.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.760]   Go back, look at the people that wrote Lonely Planet books.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.960]   Look at all the authors.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.320]   Do you think if you got a random email from someone, maybe even someone listening to this
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.200]   and said, "Hey, I'm planning a trip to Iceland.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.960]   Would you help answer some questions?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.720]   Or even could I hire you for a couple hours to help me think about what I should do?"
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.800]   Is that a hack to go find journalists or authors of guidebooks and
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.240]   reach out to them and see if you can hire them for their expertise?
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.000]   Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.400]   However, the first question that you need to ask someone if you're going to find them
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.480]   in the back of a guidebook was "How long ago was it that you spent an extended period of
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.440]   time there?"
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.000]   Because travel content expires.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.040]   It's like dairy.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.200]   You have to keep updating.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:21.680]   It's this relentless perishing of data, which I find so gratifying in a way because every
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.480]   time you go back to the country, it's totally new.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.400]   You can't rest on your laurels.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.920]   Restaurants are always changing.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.960]   Infrastructure is changing.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.240]   The economy is changing.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.280]   There's a virus.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.480]   There's a war.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.080]   Things are always happening.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.680]   So, absolutely, you could totally flip to the back of a guidebook.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.240]   And if you find their email address, you're going to reach out.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.800]   Question number one, "When were you there?"
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.920]   Alright.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.560]   You spent a lot of time writing guidebooks at Lonely Planet.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   I don't know the exact number, but it was over 50.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:57.760]   What about that process do you think people should know about how you write the guidebooks,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.320]   about how you do the research that might give them a different perspective on how to use them?
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.120]   So, I can only speak to my experience at Lonely Planet, but guidebooks are not cursory.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:17.280]   They are deep dives into a destination with real destination experts.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.160]   And the things that are not in the guidebook are the things that were not worth putting
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.960]   in a guidebook.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.360]   I'm not going to fill a guidebook with the restaurants you shouldn't go to.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.600]   It's a waste of paper.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.640]   I am giving you all the tools to build the perfect trip that you see fit.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.480]   That's perfect for you.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.920]   It's like a choose-your-own-adventure.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.880]   Remember those books?
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.240]   Yeah, I loved it.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.120]   It's like that.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.160]   Yeah, it's okay.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.280]   Let's start at the beginning.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.000]   We're going to go here.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.520]   I'm going to tell you a little about this.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.800]   Oh, does this pique your interest?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.480]   Okay, jump over to this chapter.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   And now, we're going to talk about this part of the country.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.040]   So, I would be sent sort of army style to touchdown.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.280]   And I'll use Iceland as an example.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.640]   Six months, I'm on the ground.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.400]   There's two of us writing the book.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.920]   We cut the country in half.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.600]   I am going to every farm, every place that has a bed, every restaurant, every fjord that
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.880]   you can hike on.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.640]   And it is just a constant aggregation of data.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.800]   And then at the end, you're looking through it and you're like, "Okay, this chapter needs
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.000]   to be about 10,000 words.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.640]   So, I think I have room for X number of restaurants."
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   Okay, these were the ones that were the best across all budgets and across all
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.760]   tastes.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.080]   And you're doing these holistic data entry over and over and over and over until you
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.720]   have refined what you think is the most perfect, well-rounded document for every traveler to
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.280]   dip into.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.040]   Wow.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:50.960]   Having done that experience a handful of times, how do you use guidebook or online reviews
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.760]   differently now?
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.200]   So, the world of guidebooking has changed so much because of social media.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.000]   A lot of my research in 2007 was high impact.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:16.800]   I was charting new trails in Borneo to visit longhouse clans that had never seen outsiders
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.440]   before.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:24.240]   And then social media happened and then suddenly everyone had agency over showing the destinations
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.200]   in which they lived or the places that they were going.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.240]   And it became this modified word of mouth where you could see everything that your friend
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.320]   was doing while they were in a destination.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.600]   You could almost take notes.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.120]   And so, I think the value of the guidebook has gone down over the years as more and more
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   people travel, as the expenses around travel have been reduced and Airbnb grew.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.800]   So that we could find easier places to stay on our own.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:59.200]   There is this connectivity that has made guidebooks not obsolete, just one of many options when
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.120]   at one point they were crucial.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:16.000]   I think that something like Yelp or something like TripAdvisor are good aggregators of data.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.720]   They're good for making lists.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:27.360]   If you decide that an Airbnb is not for you in Koh Samui, Thailand, you can go on TripAdvisor
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:34.000]   and make a complete list of every boutique hotel, every luxury hotel, every whatever
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.560]   place to stay and go from there.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.520]   Do I hold value in the stars?
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.560]   No, because as someone who has actually been to every single hotel in Koh Samui, Thailand
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.520]   for Lonely Planet, I can tell you that the stars don't make sense because you travel
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:56.720]   there, you spend five days in one hotel and are you ranking it or how are you rating it
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.200]   against the hotel next door?
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.760]   You're not.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.960]   So, I don't trust it as far as deciphering which hotel is better or worse.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.080]   In fact, I would be concerned if a hotel only had five stars.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.320]   It's not making an impact.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.120]   I want one person to hate a hotel in those reviews because the walls were green or it
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.880]   didn't have air conditioning because it was open to the elements.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.320]   I want a hotel to be bold.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.680]   I want it to be memorable.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.280]   I don't want it to be like my house.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.680]   I think everyone's probably stayed at a Marriott.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   And when you go stay at just a standard Marriott...
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.640]   Look, Marriott as a brand has lots of different hotels.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   But just like the standard Marriott, it's hard to not know exactly what you're getting.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.680]   So, I could imagine someone being like, "Well, this is 10 stars because I thought it was
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.640]   exactly what I wanted.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.760]   And it met the needs, but it certainly wasn't pushing the boundaries on anything by any
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.400]   stretch."
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.120]   How do you know if you're kind of planning in advance and trying to pick between five
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.840]   hotels?
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.480]   We've agreed that the stars don't make sense.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.440]   But you had all the data but couldn't go to the country.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.680]   How would you try to figure out where to stay?
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.400]   How would you try to sort through the information that exists to you knowing that it's imperfect?
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.000]   Well, I always say in learning about other places, you learn a lot about yourself.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.520]   And I think part of that is honing your instinct.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.000]   A lot of travel requires street smarts.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.800]   It requires a lot of big decisions in real time.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.000]   Where am I going to stay tonight?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.560]   Am I getting on this train to go to Bucharest?
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.600]   What am I doing?
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:40.560]   And I think that trusting your gut when you're reading about places or when you're looking
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.200]   at photos is really important.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.880]   And I know that's a bit of a cop-out answer, but you're going to get a vibe when you start
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.400]   looking at photos online, when you're reading different things about different properties
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:50.880]   online.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.200]   I would try to find those honest photos.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.920]   I would use the TripAdvisor to click the user photos because they're not polished.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.600]   You can get a real sense of the room.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.480]   I would not be allergic to calling a hotel or emailing with a hotel.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   I think a lot of people think that your hotel experience starts the minute you check in.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.520]   That is not true.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.240]   If you are booking a hotel, your hotel experience starts the minute you booked it.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:29.280]   All of these hotels have concierge services at a certain price point, or at least they
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   have a friendly person to check in.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:37.920]   And if you don't want that experience, you can book a home or an apartment rental.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:43.120]   If you're booking a human to have with your hotel experience, use them.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.400]   People never use the concierges at hotels, or people think that they can only use it
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   on Saturday afternoon when they're in their hotel because they're looking for a place
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.960]   to eat Saturday or Friday night or six hours before they think they need it.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.040]   Email your hotel.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.280]   Email the concierge at the hotel that you're going to stay at a month before you're going
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:10.400]   to stay there and say, "I'm really interested in finding a run club, a knitting club.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.600]   I'm really interested in knowing more about your rooms.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.280]   I'm a light sleeper.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.440]   And I'm a little worried about city noise.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   What are some of the room numbers you recommend so that I won't be woken up in the middle
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.000]   of the night?"
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.320]   It is their job to provide you that service before you've even arrived.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.520]   It's definitely something I think most people don't think about.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   The best hotels I've stayed at have emailed me in advance and said, "Hey, we have a
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.080]   person here.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.440]   If you have questions, ask."
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.680]   I'll share a couple of the ones I like.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.480]   So I don't necessarily have any faith that TripAdvisor stars are good, but I think the
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.000]   review content is.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.120]   So I'll often go and be like, "Oh, a lot of countries, some hotels have sunscreen,
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.880]   just free at the pool and some don't."
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.840]   You could go to TripAdvisor and search "sunscreen" in the reviews.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.680]   One thing I sometimes do is you could just go to Instagram and search for a hotel and
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.640]   just look at what people are posting in the hotel.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.400]   People post some weird stuff.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   I've definitely seen the weird people that like to post photos almost naked in their
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:06.960]   bathroom.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.640]   But there's also people that post the vibe of the hotel on a Friday night in the lobby,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.880]   which is probably not something you might see in a TripAdvisor photo.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.720]   So that's another one.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.000]   I've probably done this once.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.280]   I can't remember where, but there's a place I was going and I just didn't know how to
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.480]   answer the question.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.040]   And I think it was maybe about "Is the Wi-Fi reliable?
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.520]   Is it fast enough to do some work meetings or something?"
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.000]   And I just found people that were there that looked like they would be able to answer the
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.480]   question.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.960]   And I just DM'ed them on Instagram and asked them a question.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.480]   I was like, "You're here right now.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.520]   Is the Wi-Fi reliable?"
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.720]   And they're like, "Yeah, it's super fast."
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.360]   I was like, "Cool."
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.760]   So I think social media gives us that channel as well.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.400]   Any other hacks you have for getting knowledge about a trip?
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.280]   Yeah, so one of the big things for me is I'll go on Google Maps or I'll go on Google Earth.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.560]   And I think a lot of people, their eye goes to the stars and the reviews on Google Maps
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.520]   about a hotel.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.200]   What I'm looking at is I'm going to zoom out and I want to see the businesses that are
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.920]   next door.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.160]   So I want to know if it's a city hotel, I want to know what's in the neighborhood.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.520]   If it's a resort on a beach, this is when it's super important.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.760]   How close is that resort to the airport?
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.960]   For good and bad reasons.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.480]   You're going to have to take a transfer.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.880]   But also, do you want your relaxing beach resort to have a plane going over your head
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.000]   every five minutes?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.680]   I want to see if there's a pet hospital next to your resort and you're going to be listening
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.920]   to barking dogs all night or things like that.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.440]   When I used to teach travel writing, Lonely Planet opened a deli office.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.840]   I think this was back in 2012.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:48.160]   And they reverse outsourced me to deli to teach upcoming Indian writers how to do a
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.120]   Lonely Planet guidebook, but for the Indian market.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:57.200]   And I had days of training with them where I'd put up a slide of a hotel room and I'd
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.720]   have everyone write a review.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.840]   And of course, this was a trap because they would just say, "Oh, the sheets are red and
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.120]   the wallpaper is nice.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.080]   And this looks like this."
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.440]   I'm like, "Okay, first mistake, five senses.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.520]   Your review needs to have all five senses.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.400]   What are you hearing?
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.200]   What are you tasting?
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.920]   What does it look like?
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.960]   What are the smells?"
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:21.040]   And I think you need to apply that to your hotel choosing too.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.800]   So one of the ways to see is what's around the hotel, you're going to get a sense of
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.280]   noise.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.080]   People are really precious about noise.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.480]   This could be a huge deal breaker at a hotel.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.000]   So I want you to think critically about that also.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.280]   I like that.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.560]   The holidays and the end of the year are always a good time for two things.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.440]   Helping those less fortunate than us and finding ways to lower our tax liability.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   Nothing brings those two things together better than being charitable, which, by the way,
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   actually has a huge impact on your happiness and is why I'm so excited to be partnering
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.520]   with Daffy for this episode.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.400]   Daffy is a not-for-profit community built around a new modern way to give, and they
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.520]   are on a mission to help people be more generous more often.

[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.200]   charity.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.760]   You can make a one-time contribution, or you can set a little aside each week or month,
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.960]   and all your contributions are tax-deductible.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.680]   Except you don't actually have to know exactly where you want to give the money right away.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.400]   In fact, you can make your tax-deductible contribution now and invest that money so
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.000]   it can grow tax-free and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.360]   Then, whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than one and a half million
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.280]   charities, schools, or faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.920]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today, and for a
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:51.280]   limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the charity
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:51.920]   of your choice.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:04.640]   Science has shown that being charitable can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.440]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.920]   They're a not-for-profit community built around a new modern way to give, and they
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.680]   have a mission I think we can all get behind, helping people be more generous more often.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.000]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving because they offer an account that makes it
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.400]   easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.960]   You can make a one-time contribution, or you can set a little aside each week or month,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.160]   and all your contributions are tax-deductible.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.880]   Except you don't actually have to know exactly where you want to give the money right away.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.680]   In fact, you can make your tax-deductible contribution now and invest that money into
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:47.280]   stocks or even crypto so it can grow tax-free and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.640]   Then, whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than one and a half million
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.480]   charities, schools, or faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.640]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.160]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.200]   charity of your choice.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:21.520]   What have you learned about how do you determine what is nice if we've agreed stars and ratings
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.560]   and all those things don't matter?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:32.400]   Yeah, so I have stayed at about 3,000 hotels, which is a bit crazy to think about.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.920]   Almost 10 years.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.480]   If just one night each, it's almost 10 years.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.080]   For Lonely Planet, I was staying in a different hotel every night.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.880]   And we used to get a lot of questions at Lonely Planet.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   How can you tell if a hotel is good if you're only there for a night or this, that, and
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.280]   the other?
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.040]   And I would joke that it only takes 18 minutes to suss out a hotel.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.880]   And the things that you're looking for are design and service.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   And they have to come together.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.040]   So, you can build a beautiful hotel that has great design, but if you can't staff it with
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.520]   individuals, it's going to be a bad stay.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.280]   And vice versa.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.160]   You can have a hotel that's completely falling apart, that's uncomfortable to stay in, and
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.120]   you can have friendly people, and it's still going to be a miss.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.080]   It's like storytelling.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.240]   You need a good story, and you need to tell it well.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   Otherwise, it's not working for you.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.200]   So, the first thing is you want to check those two boxes.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.840]   And design doesn't necessarily mean that it looks good on Instagram.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:38.160]   A lot of hotel rooms are designed without ever someone staying in them.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:44.960]   The cord to plug in your phone, it's too far, the plug from the bed, so you can't look at
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.000]   your phone in bed.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.600]   You can't find the lights.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.800]   There are too many lights.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.560]   The room should be intuitive.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.880]   I'm looking at design in that regard first.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.760]   Second, I want my hotel room to make an impact.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.840]   It doesn't need to be hot pink, but I want to feel like I'm on holiday.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.200]   I would like it to embody the destination a little bit.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.560]   It doesn't need to be a Disney-fied version of Italy.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.480]   It doesn't need to look like a cheesecake factory.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.880]   Like, I want to feel like I'm somewhere different.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.720]   And then I think I want service to be genuine.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.280]   I don't want over-polite service.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.120]   I don't want over-attentive service.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.760]   I think that there's a balance to when you want someone for help, that they're there
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.640]   to help you and that they know the destination.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.440]   I want the hotels to be staffed by people who are knowledgeable.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.280]   That can enhance my experience.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.440]   Otherwise, I'm just going to go stay in an Airbnb.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.280]   I think smaller, I'm looking for cleanliness.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.920]   Rooms generally get tired after seven years.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.520]   You have to replace a mattress.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.400]   Mattresses are 10 years old and they expire.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.880]   I want that mattress replaced after seven.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.960]   I want to be taken care of.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.880]   I want the amenities in the room to be thought through.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.360]   And I don't want people to skimp on a crappy Q-tip.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.480]   I want a good Q-tip.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.160]   It's things like that.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.680]   Is that a metric?
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.080]   Instead of five stars, you should have your own sliding scale of Q-tip quality metric.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   Yeah, for me, it's Q-tips and club sandwiches because every hotel around the world has both.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.400]   I want to know if that club sandwich is how well it's going to be served,
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.760]   how well it's cooked.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.600]   I want to know how far the kitchen is based on how warm or cold it is, how fast it comes.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:36.640]   And a Q-tip is the best thing in a room because everyone knows that they like a nice sturdy Q-tip.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.680]   And if it's flimsy and there's not that much cotton on it,
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.440]   they don't really care about you at this hotel and that money is the bottom line.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.480]   Wow, I like that.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.880]   Who has the best Q-tips and club sandwiches?
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.560]   Man, that's a really good question.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.600]   I have found, and this is maybe a little bit of French snobbery in me,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.680]   but countries around the world that have been touched by French influence
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.360]   always have it figured out much better.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.320]   I've eaten an incredible club sandwich in Madagascar, for example.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.000]   And where?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.160]   So in Tena, in the capital, I stayed at this guest house that had amazing food,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.760]   truly amazing food.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.680]   And it's just the care and that sort of French style of hospitality
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   where every detail is important.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.960]   You have that joie de vivre.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.800]   It really made it a very memorable stay.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.160]   And it was only supposed to be kind of like a layover stay.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.320]   I was in the middle of Madagascar on a trip
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.520]   and then had to connect through the capital to do another portion.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.760]   And I didn't think I was going to get much out of it.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.800]   And then it just turned out to be this wonderful place.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.480]   You have to send us the name of this place and we'll put it in the show notes.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.560]   Any other places known for their club?
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.800]   I've had some of the best Western food in Japan.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:56.400]   And that is because there's this deep-seated element to Japanese culture
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.680]   where they scout the world for interesting things
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   and then they reappropriate it and improve it.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.520]   And ramen is the best example of that.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.040]   Chinese by origin.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.760]   They brought it over to Japan after World War II.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.680]   It got really popular.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.480]   The broth, four days of pork broth steeping.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.920]   And they made it into something that was really their own.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.480]   And I think I see them doing it a lot with baked goods,
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.680]   French breads, different things like that.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.320]   You will have the best pastries of your life in Tokyo.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.480]   There are countries that everyone talks about and are overrated.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   And then there's countries that everyone talks about
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.960]   and you should still definitely go and just keep going.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   And I think Japan is like the essence of a country
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.520]   that everyone talks about and you should still keep going.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.920]   I 100% agree.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   I think there are places around the world of incredibly wondrous places
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.600]   that everyone already knows about.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.480]   You should still go.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.160]   You don't have to be a contrarian.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.440]   Machu Picchu.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.080]   It's incredible when the clouds lift off of it in the morning.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.840]   It is amazing.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.280]   I want you to go do it.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.720]   Just because a lot of other people have doesn't mean you should skip it.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.680]   What else is on that list of places that even though everyone seems to go there,
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.880]   you think are still standout destinations?
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.200]   Japan is always at the top of my list.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.680]   When people ask me what are my favorite places,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:37.200]   I just would encourage people not to treat it totally as this otherworldly thing
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.320]   because then you don't have the opportunity to connect
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.880]   and have that meaningful experience.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.360]   I don't treat it like an alien world.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.040]   There are a lot of things that are similar but improved
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.160]   like the club sandwich I was mentioning before.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:58.400]   The attention to detail and care is a different form of hospitality,
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.040]   the way that things are presented, the aesthetics.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.880]   I once did a story for Bloomberg where I went to Kyoto
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.120]   and I wrote a whole story about what if you did only new things in Kyoto
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.240]   because everyone's hardwired to think Tokyo new, Kyoto old.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.440]   But what if we flip the script and we did Tokyo old, Kyoto new.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:26.000]   And I found these incredible photographers, performance artists,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.640]   people that were changing the way sushi is made.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.240]   And it was maybe one of my best four days in Japan ever by doing Kyoto new.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.200]   Wow. And then Tokyo old as well?
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.520]   Tokyo old, you can go to the northeast part of the city.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.240]   It was the only area that wasn't really bombed during World War II
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.560]   and it didn't suffer as much during the Great Kanto Earthquake in the 1920s.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.520]   And all of that is really well preserved.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.680]   Rent a bicycle, go through Yanaka, that neighborhood.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:07.040]   I wrote The Lonely Planet Guide to Japan and I created a pilgrimage
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.600]   that people do on New Year's but I created it so you could do it anytime.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.560]   And you're looking for seven shrines of seven different deities.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.040]   And it's good luck to do it on New Year's to go to all seven.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.000]   But I laid them out in one of the older neighborhoods.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.520]   You could do it anytime.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.400]   And the point was just getting you through some of these back alleys
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.480]   so that you could see some old ceramics shops.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.320]   And I didn't want to name the shop because I wanted you to find it on your own.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.920]   I like that.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.400]   And do you feel like for someone going on this experience,
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.680]   just walking into the shop, you don't need to know which one,
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.880]   you don't need to have a reservation, you can just explore in a place like that?
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.360]   Yeah, I think sometimes when there's a really cool neighborhood
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.280]   that you want people to check out, it actually doesn't damage to pick
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.320]   the one ramen place in the neighborhood that has 10 great ramen places.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.040]   And I've tried all of them and the differences are negligible.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.240]   There's so much joy in the feeling of discovery
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.760]   that I'd rather just lead you to the cool neighborhood
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.200]   and then let you figure it out from there.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.680]   And I think that's what actually a lot of people want these days.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.720]   Right now, I'm late for lunch on the West Coast
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.440]   and a bowl of ramen is exactly what I want these days.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.360]   I know so many people that plan a trip to Japan
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.840]   and it's I'm going to Tokyo and I'm going to Kyoto.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.640]   Throw out a few places that someone going to those two cities should tack on.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.320]   Sure.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.640]   I think if Kyoto is your vibe,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.680]   and you're a little worried that it's going to be overrun with tourists,
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.120]   I would go to Kanazawa.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.760]   In the feudal times of Japan, Kanazawa was the second most powerful area.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.720]   So it's giving you a lot of the Kyoto vibes that you're looking for.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.160]   Less tourists, a little bit smaller scale.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.800]   And right outside of Kanazawa is Kaga.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.080]   And it's a region that has a lot of hot mineral water.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   So it's one of the most popular onsen destinations where you can go for a soak.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.520]   This area has some of the coolest ryokan hotels,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.760]   which are these little inns that usually have a hot spring attached.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.040]   And it's a completely inclusive, immersive stay
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.760]   where you're always wearing your yukata robe.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.280]   And you have this set dinner and everything's planned out for you.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.560]   And you're just constant hospitality and everything's taken care of.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.800]   Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people are really into Hokkaido,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.120]   you know, leaving Honshu, the main island, going to Hokkaido, going to Kyushu.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.640]   Shikoku is often left off of people's itineraries.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.000]   And this is the Japan that hasn't been glamorized.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.840]   There's a lot of really cool inns, Minshuku, where you can stay.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.720]   And you'll have that experience where you're going to cook
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.920]   with the person who runs the inn, but because they need your help,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.440]   not because you're paying them to have that commoditized cooking experience.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.880]   Sounds awesome.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.360]   We are anxiously awaiting the reopening of Japan for another trip back.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.560]   It was our last trip before the pandemic.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.960]   So hearing you talk about writing The Lonely Planet for Japan,
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.600]   which I imagine was months of time getting to explore everything about the country,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   it makes me just think, "Wow, you have the best job in the world."
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.640]   And I'm sure many people listening here would agree.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.480]   From that perspective, what's the downside to having a job where
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.400]   you basically get to go live in incredible places on someone else's dime,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.160]   eat at the best restaurants, go try out all these amazing hotels?
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.240]   There has to be something that keeps everyone from wanting to do it.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.840]   There is a really tough pace to keep.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.560]   And I know all of us are pretty stressed by our jobs these days.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.920]   But the pace that you have to go into a destination,
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.440]   try your best to uncover everything that you need for your story,
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.880]   and not miss anything, but also not miss your deadline is really tough to balance.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.720]   And for me, I've had a hard time balancing that at different points in my career.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:05.680]   What's funny about travel is that you have to pack every day to move to a different place.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.320]   And so you have to be super mindful about the big and the small.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.040]   Travel writing is one of those skill sets that you need to know big picture,
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.520]   you need to know your destination, the context,
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:23.440]   how it sits against other destinations and paint a world in your story.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.560]   And then you need to know that the bus leaves at 2.45 so that you don't miss it.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.120]   And that you need to get all the things from your room so you don't leave a bunch of stuff in your
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.400]   room. It only exists in the two extremes and nothing in the middle.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.800]   And I think 99% of careers are in the middle.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.280]   So you have to really hone your ability to think super macro and super micro.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.600]   So you mentioned that you're always packing every day when you're writing these
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.000]   books and trying out these new hotels every day.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.640]   I want to talk a little about packing and the hacks around what you bring on a trip.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.520]   Because 3,000 hotels, you've packed your bags more than I think anyone
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.600]   has ever packed their bags ever in their life.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.760]   You've probably thought about every single item you bring on a trip,
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.160]   every type of clothing, everything more than once.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.320]   What are things you've learned in that process?
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.520]   When I was really into this one particular bag,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:25.120]   it was called the over-under bag because it was a rolling suitcase that was a bit squishy.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.320]   And it was two different sizes depending on a zipper.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.160]   Going on the trip, it could be a carry-on.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.080]   And then if you bought things while you were there,
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.800]   it could expand to a bag that went under the plane.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.600]   I was really obsessed with this bag for a long time.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:43.920]   Also, you want to have a soft bag if part of your trip is going to be on a small airplane.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.320]   So it's great to have the Rimavan and
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.520]   those kinds of bags that have a hard shell to protect everything within.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.760]   But you can't bring them on safari planes or puddle jumpers in the Caribbean.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.440]   So I would always travel, especially for Lonely Planet, with this
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.560]   squishy over-under because I didn't know what I was going to get myself into.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.000]   But I always was prepared.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.840]   So that was my first thing.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.680]   And do you still carry it?
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.280]   Yeah, I still have it.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.880]   What else are you bringing?
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.360]   Shoes, cameras?
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.440]   What kinds of things do you bring to make a trip perfect for you?
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.120]   If there's one thing that you want to whittle down,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.960]   it's shoes because they take up so much room.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.640]   They are filthy.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.240]   So if you can have a versatile shoe that can read,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.400]   you can go to a nice restaurant in a certain shoe,
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.040]   but you can also do a really long walk.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.960]   I would invest in that and invest in a very comfortable version of that.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.400]   That's the first thing.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.120]   You don't want to fill your bag with five different pairs of shoes.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.600]   Is there a shoe or two you've found that do that?
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.760]   I like Palladiums a lot.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.040]   They're really durable.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:55.280]   And I think they were made for the French army using leftover tires.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.040]   And now they're like a super durable shoe.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.640]   You can go on a hike.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.760]   And they're cool enough looking that you can definitely wear them to a bar.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.560]   Awesome.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.240]   What about taking photos?
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.680]   Talk about how you balance capturing a trip with really experiencing a destination.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.600]   Yeah, photography is tricky.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:19.280]   I think that a lot of people live their lives on social media.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.640]   And when you're in a place,
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.720]   you'll find that people are looking at the destination through their phone.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.840]   For some people that works, that's not really my bag.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.640]   I tend to be very present in what I'm doing.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.800]   And I forget sometimes to post on social media.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.880]   I'm not like huge on social media,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.960]   but I do enjoy making people jealous every once in a while with a fun photo.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.280]   I'll take a lot of photos to jog my memory
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.400]   for when I'm writing up an article after I get home.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.200]   And there have been these moments that I wanted to capture
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.720]   when I see something truly unique.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.840]   And it's usually not the sunset at the Eiffel Tower
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.600]   of which there's already 50 better versions.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.640]   But I like capturing those moments of serendipity.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.760]   The best example I can think of was on a trip to Kyrgyzstan a few years ago.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.600]   I was with a group of semi-nomadic people
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:20.560]   and they had a really busted up old car that they were driving around in.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.840]   And they were eagle hunters.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.440]   And we got out of the car, parked,
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.280]   and the father put his eagle on his arm before he let it go hunt.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   And it's this photo of this.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   He's wearing these 2,000-year-old seeming skins.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.160]   The eagle is on his arm cawing.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.120]   And there's this beaten up car from 1972 right beside him.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.600]   It's this bizarre moment of juxtaposition.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.360]   And I just had to have it.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.400]   It couldn't just be a memory for me.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.240]   It had to be a photo.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.120]   It's not a quantity thing for you.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.000]   It's trying to find the moments that are really different
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.600]   and something that you'd want to look back on and remember.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.440]   Yeah, I don't want a photo that someone's already taken a better version.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.360]   I want to capture my moments of serendipity.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.960]   That's what I use photography for.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.740]   Cool.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.120]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.920]   I get it.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.520]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.600]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.520]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.200]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.000]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.840]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.200]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.800]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.440]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.320]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.000]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.520]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.440]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week,
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.040]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.640]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.520]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.560]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:36.160]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.960]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.440]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.040]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.160]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.320]   You've traveled a lot. What are your favorite hacks that we haven't hit on already?
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.960]   I really like helping people plan their trips.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.200]   And I know that we touched a little bit on some of the kind of big picture things,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.720]   but one rule that I like to apply to a lot of trip planning is
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.120]   an hour on a plane for a day in the destination.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.920]   And you don't have to follow it exactly, but it kind of goaltends a little bit.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.280]   If you're going to fly across the country, across America,
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.880]   and it's going to take four or five hours, try to have four or five days
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.160]   because you're going to spend so much time in transit.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.880]   Flying is tricky. You have to be there early.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.480]   You're going to be on the flight. Bank some time in the destination
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.920]   or pick a closer destination if you only have two days.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.360]   You know, if you're only doing a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.400]   pick a place that's an hour's flight. Don't try to go to Paris for two days.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:48.320]   You're just going to end up tired and not getting out of it what you wanted.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.920]   So one hour in the plane for one day in the destination.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.040]   I would design an itinerary like the way you read a fairy tale,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.320]   where it starts off where you're setting the world.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.160]   So you're understanding the world in a broader way.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.800]   And then there's turmoil.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.520]   And that means a difficult experience. Give yourself a challenge.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.640]   Give yourself --get out of the box, try something new.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.560]   It can be a physical challenge, a big hike, an overnight camping,
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.280]   something that maybe is a little bit unusual for you, and then have a happy ending.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.360]   So put your best hotel at the end. Put your most expensive hotel at the end.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.640]   You don't want everything else to feel disappointing
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.360]   because it came after the best thing you did.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.280]   Is there a place you think people are overspending or underspending?
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.880]   Are they spending too much on food when they travel or hotels when they travel?
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.160]   And if they spent their money in a different way, they might have a better trip?
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:50.560]   It's interesting to look at nationalities and how they spend.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:56.080]   A lot of different cultures will spend way more on hotels and then way less on food,
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.000]   like Americans, for example.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.240]   But then you see Israelis, for example, actually spend way more on food than they do on hotels.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.840]   So there's a lot of cultural differences that dictate
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.880]   how we're spending our money in our different destinations.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.480]   Americans really like to have the comfort.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.200]   They like to have their nice big bathroom and a clean toilet and a nice bed.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.880]   That's super important to them.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.520]   And so I can't really judge how people are going to spend their money when they're away.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:31.040]   But what I can say is that there are a lot of big value destinations,
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:36.000]   places where your dollar is going to go way further than the place you thought you wanted to go.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.640]   I love Iceland and I'll tell you everything you want to know.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.480]   I've written books about Iceland.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:50.240]   But if you're looking for those chiseled fjords and tundra and wildlife for big night skies,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:55.200]   and you think that it's going to be Iceland, I would challenge you to think of somewhere
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.920]   that might seem less sexy like Newfoundland in Canada.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.640]   It looks like it broke off from Iceland.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   And I think it really did.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.400]   There's all the fjords.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.880]   You're going to get the whales puffing in the bay.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.280]   You're going to get icebergs floating by.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.680]   Incredible accommodation, incredible food, the fish.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.320]   Oh my god.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.680]   The biggest fishing banks in the world are off the coast of Newfoundland.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.880]   And you're going to spend kroners in Iceland.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:30.560]   You're going to spend Canadian dollars, which is like monopoly money for an American in Canada.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:31.600]   Wow.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.880]   Are there other places like that where you'd say,
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.480]   "If this is what you were looking for, here's an awesome thing you haven't considered"?
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.240]   If you're thinking about mountains and Alps, and you want to go to Switzerland or France
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:50.880]   or Italy, and you want your Lake Como and you want to have your Heidi experience,
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.400]   go to Slovenia instead.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.200]   It's right next door.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.040]   It's still in the Alps.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.960]   You're getting those snow-capped mountains.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.920]   You're getting the lakes.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:04.640]   You're getting food that is basically cheaper Italian food.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:09.120]   You're going into people's homes and they're smoking salamis in their basement.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:16.800]   And you're having wine that shares veins of loam and soil with some of the most famous
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.240]   Italian wines.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.320]   But very few people think to go to Slovenia.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:24.880]   I'm going to let you keep going because I now have two new places to go on my list.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.400]   So what else do we hit up?
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:31.920]   I think that people want to go to Australia because they want to see the other end of
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.400]   the world.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.520]   I love Australia.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.320]   I think the color of the sky in Australia is different than it is in America.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.000]   That's the first thing that you'll notice.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.320]   And it's this place of incredible desolation when you get out of the cities.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.720]   And a lot of people think that they want to go up the East Coast, Queensland.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.680]   They want to go to Cairns.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.280]   They want to see the Great Barrier Reef.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.560]   But go to Western Australia.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.520]   That's where it's at.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:02.720]   Because if you want that orange desert, the Uluru sand, and you want the Turquoise Bay,
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.080]   they actually collide in Western Australia.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:12.720]   So if you're on the Ningaloo Reef or you're in Exmouth, Shark Bay, all that bright orange
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:20.080]   sand from Uluru hits the coastline at the clearest water you will ever see halfway up
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.600]   the coast between Perth and Broome.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.200]   That's amazing.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.400]   You write about a lot of this.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:28.000]   You wrote a whole article on where to go in 2022 that I'll link here.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.400]   Any other places to highlight from that list that someone thinking about maybe a trip in
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.120]   the fall this year should consider that they probably weren't already thinking about?
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.280]   So I'll let you in on a secret.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.520]   I actually consult on a lot of those lists for a lot of different magazines.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:51.440]   So I contributed to a list for Harper's Bazaar this year.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.800]   And I also contributed to the list for Bloomberg.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.080]   And they're very different readers.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.120]   Bloomberg tends to skew male, active.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.200]   Harper's Bazaar tends to be their mistresses.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:09.760]   And so I pick very different places depending on the audience.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.440]   I try to tailor those lists to whoever's paying attention.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:20.240]   Creating those lists has been hugely difficult for the last few years because of geopolitics
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.200]   and COVID.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:27.280]   And I think what we're seeing in travel right now is a return to travel 101 where people
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.920]   miss the places they like to go.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:36.720]   We're seeing a lot of interest in France and Italy and Greece and the UK and Ireland.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.800]   People really want to go back to Japan.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:45.680]   Whereas before the pandemic in the year leading up to the pandemic, I was in Uzbekistan, the
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.400]   Gambia.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:53.360]   I was dipping into places that were on the verge of being on our mental maps.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:57:01.520]   So I would encourage people to go back to the places that they miss first, fulfill that
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.240]   need, and then start looking at the new.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:12.800]   And I know that's not a super sexy answer, but I think there's a lot of places that are
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.440]   perfectly pronounceable that we should be checking out.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:20.800]   Next week, I'm going to Madeira, for example, a Portuguese-owned island off the coast of
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.160]   Africa.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:28.080]   And I think that strikes the perfect balance of familiar and new because Portugal has been
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.920]   trending for a few years now.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.360]   It's a place that everyone in the travel media world has hit.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.080]   Madeira is a little off-kilter, right?
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:40.400]   It's going to give you that Portuguese sensibility, but you're going to get these volcanic crags
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.480]   and you're going to get passing whales and you're going to stay in a quinta instead of
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:44.960]   a hotel.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.680]   You're going to stay in a little inn that's tended to by local individuals, and you're
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.880]   going to eat fresh seafood, and you're going to see a different version of a place that
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.600]   you know.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.160]   I think I have whales on my radar, too, this year for another story.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   Again, a slightly off-kilter version of something you probably already know, the UK, but we're
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.720]   going to go into little villages and crumbling castles.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:14.640]   And there's a huge whiskey industry that has really grown over the last 20 years.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.200]   And now they're ready to compete with scotch.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.880]   And I want to go see what that's about.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.120]   Everything is like version 2.1.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:28.160]   Is there an argument to be made that if the hottest places in travel right now are the
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.120]   Spain, the Italy, the France, now is the year to go counter.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.320]   Go to Uzbekistan.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.200]   Go to the places that no one's wanting to go to.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.440]   Is that where maybe the best deals are to be had in the next year or two?
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:47.520]   I think we're running into something a little tricky, which is that there is this sort of
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.720]   latent xenophobia that we're finding because countries are concerned about how other countries
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.640]   handled COVID.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.160]   And we're seeing supply chain issues.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.720]   We're seeing this sort of fake fuel issue.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.680]   And everyone's girding their loins.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:13.040]   And what we're going to see is that travel will be easier based on where trade already
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:13.680]   occurs.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.920]   So Canada, America, Mexico is going to remain a really easy artery to travel within.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.560]   Europe will be easy for Europeans.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.000]   Asia is sort of multipolar.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.440]   So you're going to see easy travel within the Middle East, easy travel within South
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.960]   Asia, East Asia.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:34.640]   It's going to remain easier to travel in our regional bubbles.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   And prices will go up if you want to bust through that bubble.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:46.480]   So if you can find that inexpensive plane ticket to Uzbekistan, seize the opportunity
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.160]   because unfortunately, I think that will only get worse.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.440]   So you mentioned Uzbekistan as a great place.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.480]   What's on your list?
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.880]   I think you've hit, what, 130 countries.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.760]   Are there places that somehow you've just never had the opportunity to go to, but really
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.320]   want to?
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.840]   And when are you going?
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.400]   So yeah, I have been to about 130 countries.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:15.600]   And I do not want to be accused as a country counter because I've been to Iceland 37 times.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.880]   I have three trips to the Tahiti plan this year.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.360]   I like to go back to a lot of places that I know.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.680]   And I like to dig even deeper.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:29.200]   I do try to find opportunities to visit somewhere new, but I want it to be organic.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.680]   I don't want to go somewhere and not have a plan or a point of view or an idea for a
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.160]   story.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.400]   I like to go everywhere with a mission.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.760]   My mission tends to be finding information and personalities for an article.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.880]   And so when things start to bake in those places, I prioritize that new place.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:53.280]   I am really interested in countries that are about to pivot from oil to tourism.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:01.840]   I think for a lot of places are just totally off the map because they've never been interested
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.480]   in garnering tourists until now.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.040]   So a country like Angola off the coast of Southwest Africa, because they've done so
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.240]   much offshore drilling, the interior of their country is pristine.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:25.600]   And we've seen so many parts of Southern Africa get turned into agriculture or forms
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.920]   of monetizing the land.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.680]   But this is a country that is wild in the interior.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.360]   And I want to go before it develops.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.320]   So I tried so hard to go to Angola.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.160]   And I don't mean that in a strange way.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:46.240]   I physically tried so hard because we were in Namibia and there was a river between Namibia
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:46.960]   and Angola.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:54.800]   And we had a hand dug canoe and a guy I'd met traveling from Sweden and I attempted
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:01.440]   to row to the other side to go say hi to some people that were in Angola.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.400]   And we literally could not cross the current of the river.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   And we tried so hard.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.400]   So Angola has a special place for me as one of the few countries that I could maybe even
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.560]   throw a rock to, but I physically was not able to get myself into.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.440]   Now, I have no idea what the legal ramifications of crossing the border in an unauthorized
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.120]   place would have been separate, but was not possible physically.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.000]   I have been on the Kunene River myself and touched into Angola, but I don't count it.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.920]   I was actually trying to say hi to some people too and touched down.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.720]   But in my mind, I was like, I can't count this as a visit.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.120]   I need to go to Luanda and start from the beginning.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.720]   Do you have a requirement to say you've been to a place?
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.320]   Obviously, you can't just be touching the ground.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.480]   You need to spend a night there, a meal there.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.440]   What's your rule?
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.480]   My personal rule is that, first of all, I need to be choosing to go there.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.840]   So a lot of people who've had a layover in a country, they say that they've been to that
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.320]   country.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.360]   That doesn't count for me.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.240]   It needs to be my end destination.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.280]   It can be part of a three-country trip or something like that.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.600]   But I have to spend a night in that place.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.320]   It used to be that you had to get a stamp.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.000]   So many countries don't use stamps now.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.040]   So you mentioned you write a lot for Bloomberg now.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.200]   And there is a series of articles that you've written.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.920]   And I went deep on them.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.680]   And I imagine when I start talking about them, people listening will too.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.760]   I don't even know how it all started.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.040]   So I'd love to hear the story.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:34.000]   But best I understand it, you spend a few days to a week doing a hospitality job at
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.120]   the intersection of really high-end luxury and report on the inner workings.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.960]   I read about you working on a private jet at a high-end hotel, being the maitre d at
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.440]   Nobu, working on a luxury yacht.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.600]   How did that happen?
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.120]   And how has that experience been?
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:59.360]   The origin story is totally random, and we did not think it was going to turn into a
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:03:59.920]   column.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   A friend of mine used to work for Norwegian.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:10.000]   And they started long-haul flights between North America and Europe.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.440]   And they were so well-priced.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.960]   And they were all new planes.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:19.760]   And even though the premium economy was pretty comfortable and inexpensive, he was pitching
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.880]   it to me for an article.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.200]   And I was like, "Listen, I love this.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.080]   It all sounds great.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.200]   It's not reinventing the wheel, though."
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.120]   And he was like, "What if you worked as a flight attendant on one of our planes?"
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.440]   And I was like, "That sounds cool, but crazy.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.160]   I mean, how?
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.960]   I'm not trained."
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.960]   And it took three months of getting all these different approvals.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.200]   And we did it completely above board.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.920]   And sure enough, I worked as a flight attendant on a long-haul flight from London to New York.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.880]   And I interviewed my colleagues.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.440]   And I reported authentically on what it was like to be on that plane.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.360]   And the traffic on that story was absurd.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.040]   We'd never seen numbers like that for a travel story at Bloomberg.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.480]   And then we thought, "What if I did another job?"
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.040]   And the next job that I did was I was a butler at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.480]   And that story did even better.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.640]   And from then on, in-house, we called it the butler stories.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.680]   "Oh, what's the next butler story that you're going to do?"
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.000]   Because the vibe of it was service.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.760]   So service heroics is essentially what it is.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.800]   And I go all over the world to the world's most coveted brands.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.200]   I embed myself in the product.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.800]   I serve the wealthy elite of the world.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.880]   And I report on what it's like to do so.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.200]   So I was a personal shopper at Barney's.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.880]   I was a maitre d' at Nobu.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.440]   I was a ski instructor in Aspen.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:58.240]   I worked on a superyacht in the Caribbean, a private jet in Texas.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.400]   I just actually finished another one.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.720]   I'm on deadline to write it all up.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.480]   And that one will be coming out at the end of April.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.960]   And it's been one of the coolest things in my career, to be honest.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.840]   And I used to think that I was trading in obscure geography,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.440]   and that I always wanted to be the first person
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.920]   that had boots on the ground and an emerging destination.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.280]   But writing these stories has given me incredible access
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.160]   to some places that have been so private to the world before.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.360]   Are there some examples of some of the most interesting things
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.880]   you've seen or learned?
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.240]   I will fully endorse anyone listening to go read them,
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.280]   but throw out a few of the good juicy bits to get people excited.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.720]   I think the first thing that comes to mind
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.320]   is what really propelled this into a different stratosphere,
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.720]   which was for the Plaza Hotel.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.600]   I was on break, and I was chatting with my fellow butlers.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.680]   And I was just like, "What's the deal with Eloise?"
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.040]   There's the Eloise Children's book about how she lives in the Plaza Hotel.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.040]   And he was like, "Oh, yeah, it's a really big deal.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.400]   Everyone loves Eloise here."
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.120]   One time, a room called and asked for a butler
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.680]   to bring up the Eloise book and read them a bedtime story
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.400]   to read Eloise as the bedtime story.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.200]   And I was like, "Okay, sure, that's a little quirky."
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.400]   And when we got to the room, there was no child in the room.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:31.360]   There were four adults in their 30s all in the same bed,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.000]   like Charlie Bucket's grandparents.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.560]   And they were all like, "Okay, read us the story now, please."
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.080]   And he read them Eloise for 90 minutes.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.000]   And they were like, "Thank you, that's all."
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.160]   And that was the perfect amount of quirkiness
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.920]   to launch the series into popularity.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.720]   And every time I do one of these jobs,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.760]   I'm sniffing around for that Eloise moment.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.000]   I don't need to tell you about the sex, drugs, and rock and roll
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.440]   because yeah, it's a private jet on a super yacht.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.400]   Are you surprised people are doing sex, drugs, and rock and roll?
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.120]   No.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.160]   Are you surprised that someone is reading four adults
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.640]   a children's book as a bedtime story?
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.680]   Yeah, that's more fun.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.360]   So I'm trying to find the humor in it.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.240]   There's humor.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.600]   There's still absurdity.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.440]   I read that someone had Fiji water installed in their house,
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.480]   including their shower.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.520]   Someone that spent 10s of thousands of dollars
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.400]   to raise the height of the sink in their bathroom at a hotel,
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.480]   which I think you said they literally needed to involve construction equipment.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.800]   Yeah, actually, that is one of the other things that I think about often.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.560]   It was a hotel in Chicago,
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.360]   and a couple was going to Chicago for a 3-day weekend.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.400]   And the wife called the hotel and was like,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:57.040]   "Do me a favor, measure how high the vanity is off the floor."
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.800]   They were like, "Okay, yeah, we'll get back to you."
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.560]   And, "Oh, it's 45 inches."
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.400]   And she's like, "Hmm, that's not going to do.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.760]   It needs to be 52."
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.640]   And they were like, "Okay, well, we'll raise it,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.000]   but it's a marble vanity, so we're going to need to get new marble,
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.480]   and it'll cost about $55,000."
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.000]   She's like, "Okay, sounds good."
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.080]   So they raised it.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.200]   She stayed for three nights, and that's all she wrote.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:28.080]   And the reason was she didn't like bending down too far to wash her face.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.440]   I don't even have words.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:35.120]   Like, the number of vacations you could take for the cost of raising that sink.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.080]   I don't know why she didn't find another hotel that maybe had a higher sink.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.320]   It seemed cheaper or easier, but wow.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.200]   You worked as a maitre d' at a hot restaurant in New York.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.480]   You worked at a hotel.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.040]   You worked in a lot of the kinds of places that me, you, people listening,
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.520]   will end up going to or wanting to go to.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.560]   What did you learn when it comes to ways that we might
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.960]   apply some tricks or some tips or some tactics to get the reservation
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.520]   at the hard-to-get-to table or to get the upgrade at the hotel
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.640]   or get the good treatment on the plane from the flight attendants
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.160]   or something like that?
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.200]   At Nobu, I spent an afternoon with the reservations team
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.200]   because I was really curious how to hack that on a personal level.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:23.760]   And they said that the best time to call is at around 4.15 p.m.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.200]   because a lot of people do last-minute cancellations.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.320]   And they will do it when they see their dinner coming on the horizon.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.720]   They realize they're going to be late or someone can't make it.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.000]   And that happens before 5, but usually a little bit after 4.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.800]   They said right in that 4.15 sweet spot was if you call day of,
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.480]   you could probably get a table.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.920]   I've heard everything from restaurant reservations to even daycare,
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.760]   where it's like, "Even though we have a waitlist,
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.080]   we usually just take whoever calls first."
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.040]   So I imagine that was maybe similar at Nobu.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.600]   There might be people that say, "If something opens up, give me a call."
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.720]   But they're going to prioritize whoever just calls in the moment.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.880]   Definitely. I think you can certainly give them a ring and say,
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.160]   "If anything opens up, give me a call."
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.360]   And then you need to be proactive.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.320]   You need to call at 4.20 or 4.30 and say,
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.040]   "I'd really like to come in. What can we make happen?"
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.160]   I think the less constraints you put on that reservation too,
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.920]   the likelier it is that you'll find a place.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.640]   What about tipping?
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.560]   Is the go up to the maitre d and offer a tip to get a table?
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.680]   Is that a real thing?
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.600]   No, I think that's a dated TV show kind of thing.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.880]   I don't think that's going to work.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.840]   But they do leave tables open for VIPs.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.680]   They are ready at a moment's notice.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.800]   If Blake Lively walks in the door and she wants a table, they're going to give her one.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.280]   So, it's really more about who you know.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:54.640]   One thing that you could do -- everyone's going to hate that I say this --
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.160]   is everyone's always thinking about concierges at hotels
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.000]   and the cities that they're going to visit.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.480]   Make friends with a concierge at a hotel in the city you live in.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:14.160]   Because a lot of times, what people will do is they will hold tables for concierge friends
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.720]   at a Four Seasons or at a St. Regis or something like that.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.640]   So that when they have a big spender come and stay at the hotel,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.240]   they can funnel them a table right away.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:31.600]   So, go to a hotel in your hometown and try to make friends with the concierge there.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.600]   And that'll often work.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.640]   How would you suggest doing that?
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.880]   How would you make friends with the concierge?
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.640]   I honestly think that you could just go in and ask.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.320]   A lot of times, a concierge will say, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:52.240]   We only serve people in the hotel," or something like that.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.120]   But a lot of them are really skilled.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.760]   And they're really well trained in the art of the concierge service,
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.000]   especially the ones with the clÃ©s d'or, the golden keys that are on their lapel.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:14.240]   And sometimes they really want something to do that is germane to their skill set.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.840]   And so they will help you because these days, they're underused.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.560]   It's a lot of, "Oh, can you send my bags up to my room?"
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.720]   Or the things that they don't get much joy in doing,
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.600]   which is illuminating the destination for their guests.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.080]   Okay, so that's the plan.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:31.120]   Maybe make a reservation at a hotel restaurant and get there an hour early
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.120]   and spend some time with the concierge.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.000]   You mentioned earlier bringing gifts while you're traveling.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.160]   Not tipping, but is there a gift or something nice to bring to service people
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.280]   that might be better than a tip in any case?
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.160]   All the flight attendants told me that they responded really well to bribery.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.600]   And you could make an argument that if you learn your service names,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.880]   and you learn your flight attendants' names, that it endears them a little bit more to you.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.520]   But they really respond to candy.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.240]   They don't get to eat the stuff that's on the flight.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.840]   They eat something different.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:08.320]   And there are systems in place where pilots and flight attendants
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   are all eating different things just in case the food is bad and everyone gets sick.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.160]   There's always someone on the plane that's able to control the situation.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.640]   They tend to eat pretty poorly.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.240]   It's a lot of easily transportable stuff, bags of chips and things like that.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:34.400]   So I bet if you brought a healthy snack for a flight attendant, they would really appreciate it.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.640]   I would also dress the part.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.520]   And this is something that I think a lot of people have said before.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.360]   I always wear black on an airplane because if something spills on me, you can't see it.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.080]   And it makes you look cleaner.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.520]   Black always tends to read chic.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.560]   Colors tend to read pajamas.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.920]   And people don't really dress up for plane travel the way they used to.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.480]   And I think if you present yourself more agnostically,
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.360]   your ability to say right before everyone's boarding,
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.560]   "Oh, is there room in Comfort Plus or Premium Economy?"
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.920]   They will size you up because
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.760]   if they're moving people to the front of the plane, they want them to look good.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.280]   Has that worked?
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.320]   Have you been upgraded on a flight in the moment?
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.400]   I definitely have.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.520]   And sometimes it's just asking at the right moment.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.200]   If there's a line and they're servicing 50 people in front of you, there's no chance in hell.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.360]   But if no one's there, the plane's boarding,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.400]   you can tell by looking at the seat plan on your app of how many seats there are.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.720]   If you can tell that it seems like there's not a lot of people boarding, yeah, just ask.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.840]   I mean, especially for something like Comfort Plus on Delta.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:56.400]   If there's an empty seat, it certainly doesn't hurt to ask if the gate agents are not busy.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.320]   In the intro, I talked about this book you wrote.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:04.000]   And I want to make sure we touch on it because it's pretty crazy.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.040]   I looked at your Amazon author biography, and it's like
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.840]   40 Lonely Planets and a book about murder, mutiny in the South Pacific.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.360]   And I was like, "Oh, that's okay."
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.240]   And I dug in.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.560]   And first off, I learned that there's a part of the world I've never even heard of,
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.000]   the Picarin Islands.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.080]   Talk a little bit about what drove you to write this book, what it is, who it's for.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.720]   I found it fascinating.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.760]   And I talked to my wife about it, and she's like, "Can I read that next?"
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.520]   So I'd love you to share a little bit more.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.640]   When I worked at Lonely Planet, we definitely traded in obscure geography.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.800]   We'd all traveled the world.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.320]   And we were all looking for these weird points on the map that no one else had heard of.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:50.240]   And Picarin was a name that kept coming up because you can't get there using commercial conveyance.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.280]   But people live on this remote island.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.120]   And it is one of the most remotely inhabited islands in the world.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.280]   And only 48 people live there.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:05.440]   It's in the middle of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Peru,
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.080]   if that gives you any sense of how vast and forgotten this place is.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.560]   And the only way to get there is by cargo freighter.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.520]   And a freighter services the island four times a year,
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.480]   once every season.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.000]   And you can travel on the freighter if there's room.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.160]   And you can stay until the next time the freighter comes to make a delivery.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:31.200]   And I had traveled extensively through Papua New Guinea on my own
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.920]   with the help of someone who works in the industry.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.640]   And she reached out to me one day a few years later and was like,
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:41.920]   "There's an opportunity to send one journalist to this very forgotten island."
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.560]   And I knew it because of my time at Lonely Planet.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.960]   So she arranged for my transfer on the cargo freighter.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.960]   And I ended up spending some time there living amongst these 48 individuals
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.640]   who, of course, there's no hotel.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.960]   Because how do you get there to stay in a hotel?
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.920]   There's no restaurant.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.680]   So you're just living in these people's homes.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.320]   And I went thinking I was going to write an article for Travel and Leisure magazine.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.200]   And I did.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.040]   But when I left the island,
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:13.200]   I was just completely obsessed with everything that I learned while I was there
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.320]   about the people who live there today and about the history.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.360]   And usually, when I take on a project for work, I fall in love with the destination.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.400]   I marry it.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.880]   I make the article.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.280]   And then I go and fall in love with something else.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   And Peg Karen was this place that I just kept thinking about and thinking about.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.520]   And all the characters involved in the founding of the island
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.560]   and all the characters that live there today could all have their own articles.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:46.240]   And I realized I needed to write like a 100,000-word article,
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.280]   which, of course, is a book.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.680]   So it wasn't until after I got back from Peg Karen that I was just like,
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.000]   "Okay, I gotta keep researching.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.520]   I need to know the truth about this place.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.600]   I need to know all the details about how it was founded 200 years ago
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:05.040]   and why it's such a crazy place to visit now."
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.960]   Peg Karen is the kind of place that once you know three sentences about it,
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.560]   you're going to be instantly obsessed
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.600]   because the island was founded about 200 years ago
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.880]   when these British sailors mutinied against their captain,
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:25.280]   threw them overboard, stole the ship, and disappeared with their Tahitian brides.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.840]   And for 20 years, no one knew where they went.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.720]   They thought the ship had vanished, essentially.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.280]   And then they were discovered living on an island that was previously uninhabited.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.400]   But of all the men and women that went to the island,
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.720]   there was only one man left when they found the island 18 years later.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:50.640]   And it turned out that it was like a real-life game of Survivor
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:56.560]   where they were, instead of voting each other off the island,
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.240]   they were murdering each other.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.880]   And there were alliances that formed.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.440]   There was jealousy and secrets.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.400]   And one by one, they plotted and killed each other.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:11.760]   When they were escaping an oppressive world, they then created an oppressive world.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.840]   And before they were all murdered, some of them had kids with each other.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:20.400]   And then it's those descendants, those seventh-generation descendants
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.840]   of the original mutineers that still live there today.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.200]   And they're haunted by the trauma of the island's founding.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:35.920]   And so my book zippers the two timelines together.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:42.400]   So it seesaws back and forth one chapter present day, one chapter 200 years ago.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:47.840]   And as the story goes on, the two timelines get more and more intertwined.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.480]   And suddenly, they're completely overlapping.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.120]   And there's this pendulum swing of cause and effect.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.640]   Against the two, of course, it sort of ends with a bang,
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.360]   because by the end of at least the 200-year-old timeline, everyone's dead.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.800]   That's wild.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.240]   The book's fantastic.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   Rarely, if ever, do I know of a book that's like a thriller mystery, enthralling story,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.040]   but just also happens to be one of the craziest true stories of all time
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.520]   and weaves in a travel narrative as well.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.480]   It's fantastic.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.840]   Definitely check it out.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:23.600]   I could do a whole nother episode just learning about that island, though.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.520]   I don't think it fits in with the theme of the show.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:29.840]   So to wrap up, we talked about a lot of places.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.640]   I want you to pick a place that you feel like you're familiar with,
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.360]   which unfortunately, for all the guidebooks you've written, might be too many.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.280]   And leave us with a few things.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.120]   A place or two that people should go eat.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.720]   A place or two that people should get a drink.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.520]   And just an activity that they might not think to do.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.840]   I want this to be really useful.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.200]   I want there to be value here.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.480]   And I want to pick two places because they're both really popular.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.960]   I want to start with Iceland because it's really close to the US and to Europe.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.880]   And it's a really big impact destination because once you touch down,
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.720]   it looks like another planet.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.480]   The thing is, is everyone does it wrong.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.120]   I want to tell you, take a month and see all of Iceland.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.560]   We don't all have a month.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.960]   So if you have four days, spend one of them in Reykjavik.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.480]   People often do the opposite.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   They usually base themselves in Reykjavik and then do one day in the countryside.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.360]   Flip the script.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.920]   Stay outside of the city.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.400]   Venture into the city for one day.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.600]   It's a teeny tiny city of 250,000 people.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.000]   There's some cool cafes and whatnot.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.840]   But the reason you're there is not for the urban environment.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.440]   You're there for the nature.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.000]   I think you should forget the golden circle, which is just a marketing thing.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.680]   Go your own way up to the SnÃ¦fellsnes Peninsula.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.560]   It's a loop.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.080]   You can loop the peninsula.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.280]   There's really cool places to stay like Hotel Eielson.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.960]   It's spelt like Eagleson.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.280]   It's a beautiful little boutique inn.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.640]   I highly recommend it.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:01.040]   There's a great restaurant right across the street from that hotel.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.880]   That's a whole evening unto itself.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.800]   I think you should explore some of the public pools.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.960]   There's a lot of Blue Lagoon and all these commoditized luxury spa experiences.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:19.440]   The public pools have the same geothermal water and they're $8 rather than $80.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.360]   That's an opportunity where you get to meet locals.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.840]   People go to the pool every day and they want to talk.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.680]   Awesome.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.880]   What's the other place?
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:33.760]   I think we're all desperate to go back to Japan or go to Japan for the first time.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:38.640]   I love it there.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.880]   I just feel passionate about Japan.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   And I would love for people to focus on Tokyo in the southwest part of the city.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.280]   The Yamanote Line is a ring line that goes around the city by rail.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.440]   And a lot of people tend to stick to that line.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.200]   I would encourage you to get out of it in the southwest quadrant.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.800]   You want to be in Setagaya.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.200]   That's the part of the city you want to be in.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:13.440]   You're going to find super cool neighborhoods out there like Shimokitazawa, Daikanyama,
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.640]   Jiyugaoka.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:19.600]   These are places that you should just go, put your feet down, walk the streets.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.000]   You're going to find really cool little restaurants, tea houses.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.240]   This is everything that Brooklyn wishes it could be.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.000]   Anything specific to check out?
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.320]   So when you're in Shimokitazawa, for example, what you want to do is you want to go to everyone's
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.360]   favorite coffee shop called Bear Pond.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.600]   They make the best espresso, I promise you.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.160]   Everyone who's gone has absolutely loved it.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.120]   And take that walking around.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.480]   Everyone in Japan is okay with walking with your beverage now.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.600]   They used to not be.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   And you're going to want to walk through that neighborhood.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.360]   You're going to want to look at the street fashion.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.920]   You're going to want to go into the vintage boutiques.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:05.280]   You're going to want to see the clothes are just so well-maintained and super stylish.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.880]   And if you want to understand what's avant-garde street style, it's there.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.560]   If you pop over to Daikanyama, it's a little bit more high-end.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.200]   There's a bookshop in Daikanyama, Tsutaya.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.680]   It's three white buildings connected by bridges.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.120]   Maybe the best bookshop in the entire world.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.280]   There's a cafe inside of it as well.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.160]   Beautiful magazines, beautiful books.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.560]   There are things that you can bring home and put on your coffee table.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.280]   That's awesome.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.360]   I am ready to go back to Japan.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.840]   Before we wrap, where can people follow all the stuff you're doing, writing,
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.160]   posting photos and everything?
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.080]   Go to my personal website.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.080]   That's brandimpressor.com.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.640]   I tend to post my new articles there.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.840]   I have a link to my book, The Fire Land, there as well.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.040]   You can follow me on Instagram @brandpress.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.560]   Awesome.

[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:29.760]   [Music]
