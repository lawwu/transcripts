[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   We are joined once more by Dr. Vern Poitras.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.240]   He has degrees from Cambridge and Harvard and Caltech
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.440]   and of course Westminster Theological Seminary
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.040]   where you now live and work.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.920]   He's a genius, a New Testament scholar, a mathematician,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.360]   a man who can talk with authority
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.040]   on just about any topic under the sun
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.280]   and we're talking about your book,
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.680]   "Chance and the Sovereignty of God,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.660]   "a God-centered approach to probability
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.240]   "in random events," which was published in 2014.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.360]   At the end of this episode,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.520]   I'll tell you how to get the book for free online.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.240]   Yesterday we talked about coin tosses
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.640]   and today I want you to explain,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.800]   without going into too much of the detail,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.360]   just why are casinos confident of making a profit
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.120]   off of the gambling industry?
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.500]   You explain the math in your book,
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.260]   but for us here in like five minutes,
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.840]   can you explain why casinos don't lose money in the end?
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.200]   - Oh, right, well, they make sure.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.400]   (laughs)
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.480]   They wouldn't stay in business otherwise,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780]   but God has put in place in this world,
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.720]   in his governance of the world,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.040]   regularities even with respect
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.840]   to what we call chance events,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.800]   events that we cannot predict.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360]   The thing of the shuffling of cards
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.200]   or if you've got a roulette table
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800]   where there's a ball running around,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.960]   God is in charge of all that.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440]   And part of the marvel of it,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.640]   if we can separate it from some of the moral evils
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.480]   that crop up in gambling,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.000]   part of the marvel of it is that there's regularities
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.400]   and faithfulness and such wonderful consistency,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.040]   even in this area of so-called chance events,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   events that we cannot predict,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.100]   but you see the regularities.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.260]   If for instance, you flip a coin a thousand times,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.900]   roughly 500 of them are gonna be heads.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.340]   Why is that?
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.660]   It's an expression of the wisdom of God
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.100]   and the faithfulness of God
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.260]   in a very specialized and small area.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.500]   Well, the casinos and the lottery situation,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.300]   they are actually the people,
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.180]   there are experts now who know about these regularities,
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.740]   they've studied them and they make sure
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.860]   that they're depending on those regularities.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.520]   They're depending on God,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.540]   even if there is moral corruption
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.900]   by the people who use them,
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.540]   they're depending on those
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.700]   and they know that certain numbers
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.420]   are only gonna come up so much a percent of the time.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.020]   So when they promise a payment, it'll be a little less,
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.780]   they'll take a little cut out of that.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.260]   On the average, the excitement for the gambler is,
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.060]   maybe I can win a bundle and you might,
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.580]   because we can't make those predictions.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.700]   But if you make a bundle and you go back the next day
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.020]   and try to make another bundle,
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.820]   you'll probably lose it all back
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.160]   because in the long run,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.660]   and this is the thing of God's regularity,
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.860]   in the long run, things average out.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.860]   And as I say, in these casinos and setups like that,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.060]   the house, the owner is taking a small percentage.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.300]   He wants to make it interesting, right?
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.340]   And he wants people to be there
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.040]   who have the excitement of sometimes winning,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.780]   but he's taking a small percentage out
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.620]   with a roulette wheel, American roulette wheel,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.220]   there's a zero and a double zero
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.860]   in addition to 36 numbers.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.460]   Now that's getting into the details,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.220]   but if the ball falls on those two numbers,
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.500]   then you lose even bets.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900]   You can bet for odd, you can bet for even
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.140]   and zero and zero, zero, you lose.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.140]   So that's the little percentage.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.580]   It's about one out of 18.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.380]   One out of 18 times,
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.020]   you're not gonna break even on the average.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.100]   So that little bit is enough for the casino
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.940]   to make its amount.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.060]   The fact is that most people who are gamblers
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.880]   don't think in terms of those things.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.540]   They think in terms of getting a break
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.140]   and it's as if they're worshiping lady luck.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.180]   So again, the issue of idolatry
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.700]   is there in the background.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.020]   They think I can beat the odds
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.700]   because I'm special or something that I will do
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.460]   will give me a blessing,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.500]   but they ought to be looking to God for a blessing.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.340]   - Yeah, and we'll get to the ethics of gambling
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.460]   in just a moment, but I mean, this point is so huge.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.860]   We need to camp here for a minute
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.380]   because what you're saying
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.860]   is that God equally governs chance events
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.340]   and he rules over regularities
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.660]   and he does both of these things at the same time.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.580]   I mean, this is mind-bending
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.140]   because I think even many good Calvinists
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.260]   would tend to assume that the 500/500 split
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.940]   on coin tosses, heads and tails
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.020]   is purely random naturalism.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.880]   But you're saying that divine law
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.740]   is what makes that predictability a reality.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.360]   Unpack this for us more.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.700]   - Yeah, it's because he's the God who is the creator,
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.820]   who's the innovator.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.180]   So anything that is new, right, he's behind it.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.180]   That's the element of the novelty and the unpredictability.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.860]   And he's also a God of faithfulness
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.780]   who maintains the world in its place.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.260]   And the thing with the coins is just as a simple example,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.420]   but it's related to the issue of weather.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.100]   And there's a number of passages in scripture
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.500]   that make it clear that God brings the snow and the rain
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.580]   and sometimes a famine because there is no rain
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.940]   in a agricultural country.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.620]   God is in charge of all those things.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.660]   But if you think of the snow,
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.340]   it's each individual snowflake contributing to the snow
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.820]   or it's each individual raindrop contributing to the rain.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.720]   So there is a combination of this creativity.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.580]   You don't know where each individual raindrop
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.380]   is gonna fall and of regularity,
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   you know that there's gonna be rain.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.460]   And God is clearly showing in the scripture
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.340]   that he is to be thanked for the coming of rain
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.940]   with its combination of predictability
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.020]   and unpredictability.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.020]   We can predict the seasons and that's promised by God
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.300]   in Genesis 8, right after the flood,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   he says, "See the summer and winter
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.060]   and see diamond harvest will not fail
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.660]   as long as the earth remains."
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.460]   That's God there.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.740]   And we think of weather.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.900]   Yeah, I know we live in an environment, you know,
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.060]   where people pretend that God is absent, right?
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.220]   So weather is just weather.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.060]   No, it isn't.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.700]   It's God bringing the weather.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.980]   The seasons are his doing and he's so faithful
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.580]   that we can make predictions, right?
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.060]   And you can run the computers to make these weather models
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.860]   and it works pretty well.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.740]   You're relying on the faithfulness of God.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.940]   At the same time, you can't predict the weather
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.700]   on this day of the year, a year from now.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.420]   That's something God already knows, but we don't.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.980]   So it's both unpredictability and predictability.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.340]   And that combination is due to the fact
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.220]   that God is in harmony with himself, ultimately.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.820]   It's creativity, the things that are new and surprising
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.460]   are in harmony with his faithfulness,
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.260]   the things that are the same.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.820]   And so it can all be traced back to God.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.460]   And in fact, to God as transheron God,
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.420]   because the differentiation of three persons is God
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.660]   is in back of the differentiations
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.020]   of the variations we see in the world.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.700]   There's a vast area here.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.660]   I get excited even as I'm talking about it.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.620]   There's a vast area for us to explore and praise God for
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.540]   and to recover the biblical teaching
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.580]   that God's hand is in all this.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.900]   And it's not just, oh, this happens as if by a mechanism
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.860]   or without God being present.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.180]   - Yeah, and you should get excited.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.180]   I mean, this point has stunning implications.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.320]   Okay, now back to the ethics of gambling.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.500]   It has been humorously said that gambling
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.700]   is a tax on people who are bad at math.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.140]   And in the book, you write this, quote,
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.620]   "Gambling is a tax on people
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.340]   "who do not know probability theory," end quote.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.700]   But as you point out in the book,
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.680]   the essential problem is not bad calculations.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.300]   The essential problem is bad hearts.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.500]   And you write this, quote,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   "Gambling is a tax on alienation from God," end quote.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.400]   That's powerful.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.620]   I mean, perhaps another way we could say it is
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.420]   fundamentally gambling is a tax on people
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.780]   whose hearts are not satisfied in God.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.940]   Would you say that?
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.340]   - I would, yeah.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.700]   Yeah, because it's related to the fact
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.060]   I want to trust in something, a break,
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.900]   some special event where I will get a windfall
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.580]   rather than trusting in God.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.420]   It's an alienation of affections from where they should be.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.980]   And that at a deep level, I mean, people,
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.300]   of course, many people will suppress
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.540]   what are their true motivations,
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.780]   because that's the way sin works, right?
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.500]   You can seal from yourself some of the more rotten aspects
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.620]   of your own sinful tendencies.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.460]   So people don't, aren't conscious of it,
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.780]   but underneath there is this discontent
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.020]   with what the lot God has given you.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.340]   And sometimes discontent with the plodding nature
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.340]   of hard work.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.700]   So, you know, if I'm putting in work in a job
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.340]   nine to five, five days a week,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.420]   I'll get some benefit from that,
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.540]   but it's painful in a fallen world,
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.540]   and it takes a long time, and I'd rather get rich quick.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.420]   You know, that's what people think.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.940]   - Yeah, okay, finally, anytime we address the lottery
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.140]   or gambling, Christian Skoff, we hear from people,
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.220]   people familiar with DG and John Piper,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.980]   who will instinctively respond saying,
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.020]   you know, you fuddy-duddy fundamentalists,
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.540]   yes, I get the math, but leave me alone,
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.500]   it's just a hobby, you know, my 20 bucks in nickels
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.820]   for a casino slot machine on a Friday night,
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.500]   or my $5 scratch ticket, or my one lottery ticket
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.700]   I buy annually, it's all benign fun.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.940]   Get off my tail, Piper, get off my tail, Poythress,
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.860]   I'm not a God rejecter.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.420]   What would you say to Christians who believe
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.540]   that gambling, even on a small scale,
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.260]   is a harmless side hobby?
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.820]   - Well, I mean, I think there's several things to say.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.820]   One is that the issue of motivation is indeed primary,
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.140]   because Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.300]   goes after that underlying issue.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.820]   So it's not simply a question, well, I can keep
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.820]   to the letter of the law, and then no matter
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.100]   where my heart is, it doesn't matter,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.540]   it's for the rivers, you know.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.780]   You've got to guard your heart,
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.860]   because from it are the issues of life.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.420]   And the heart is deceitful, above all things,
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.260]   and desperately corrupt, Jeremiah.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.540]   So it's easy to conceal the fact underneath,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.940]   you know, I wanna have fun, I wanna just have
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.420]   a relaxing time, yeah, but there are different ways
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.740]   of having fun and relaxing, and what is underneath that?
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.780]   So I think that has to be the challenge,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.340]   rather than saying, mainly, we have a rule.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.980]   But there are other sides to the issue as well,
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.660]   because the whole gambling industry
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.180]   is intrinsically has areas of corruption.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.500]   And I think the Puritans, they saw the destruction
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.900]   that came out of that more broadly,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.980]   and they were just horrified by that.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.340]   And it also takes place in terms of the question of,
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.740]   even if I win money, is it illicit games?
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.700]   Because people talk about, the Proverbs has that first one,
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   it says that if you seek for sudden riches, it's folly,
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.940]   but if you gain little by little,
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.820]   and of course, it's also the virtues of hard work,
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.740]   because that's the calling that God has given us.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.580]   Then, you know, that's the way to follow the Lord's way.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.420]   So I think there are principles like that as well,
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.460]   that ought to make us ask a lot of questions
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.380]   about what are the motivations of the individual,
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.820]   but also what's the larger picture?
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.820]   And what makes me most sad is that there are people
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.340]   who they talk about an addiction
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.820]   as if an addiction is kind of like a medical thing,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.100]   but it's really a spiritual addiction.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.580]   It's a bondage to sin,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.380]   and there are people who are addicted gamblers,
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.220]   and they're destroying their families,
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:01.100]   and they get themselves into debt and all kinds of things.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.140]   It preys, I'm told, a lot on the poor,
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.900]   because the poor are looking for a quick way out
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.340]   of all the struggles of their situation,
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.340]   and this seems to offer salvation.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.340]   And again, when I use that language, you can see,
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.940]   it's really a kind of counterfeit form of salvation.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.500]   Here's what will get you out of your troubles.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.700]   - It is, and it is a sobering way to end our time this week,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.940]   but Dr. Poythress, thank you for being with us
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.660]   these past couple of days.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.340]   - You're welcome, I'm glad to have been here.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.860]   - Dr. Vern Poythress, you can get his book,
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.460]   "Chance in the Sovereignty of God" for free
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.300]   at his website at frame-poythress.org,
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.220]   frame-poythress.org.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.860]   The entire PDF is there, you can download it and read it.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.420]   It's a book publishing strategy
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.620]   very similar to ours at Desiring God.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.940]   Well, we must break now for the weekend.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.420]   On Monday, John Piper returns to answer a listener question
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.660]   who wants to know if sin has a necessary place
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.220]   in God's plan.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.100]   Does sin have a necessary place in God's plan?
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.540]   It's an interesting way to put it.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.800]   You can find all the stuff you need to enjoy
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.860]   and engage with this podcast at our online home
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.780]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.100]   I'll see you on Monday.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.260]   (upbeat music)
