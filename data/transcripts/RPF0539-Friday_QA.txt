[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua. I am your host. I
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   am your fellow traveler down this road of financial freedom, and I am your friendly
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   local financial philosopher. Here today, we try to see if we can sort truth from fiction.

[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Q&A call, and this is done in the style of a live Q&A call. I record it and then just
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   release it just a little bit after the call. Usually, these calls are open exclusively
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   to patrons of the show. You can become a patron at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron. That

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   jammed that I can't get you in. I can essentially promise you that if you want to ask a question
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   or talk about something, raise any discussion point that you would like to do, then you
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   can do that as a patron on a Q&A call. If you'd like to join as a patron at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I would dearly love to have you there. On today's call, I have members of my email list.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   From time to time, I'll try to incentivize and give an unexpected bonus to those of you
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   who connect with me in other formats. Today's, it is for my email subscribers. All of our
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   callers today are calling in from the email group, but of course, some of them could also
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   be patrons. If you'd like to join a Friday Q&A call, I would dearly love to have you
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   call next week at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron. We begin today with Ruha in Alabama. Ruha,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Hi, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call today.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   My pleasure.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I'm calling because in the next few years, we're expecting to have some pretty big medical
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   bills, and I've been giving some thought as to whether I should use funds from our
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   HSA to pay for them. I'm aware that there's several reasons why the HSA makes a good long-term
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   savings plan that you might save and hold onto until retirement age. So I guess I just
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   wanted to see if I could get your insight on when it makes sense to use it today rather
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   than save it for tomorrow.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   How much money do you expect to need to pay out in medical expenses?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   About $4,000.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   How much money do you expect to have in the account?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm guessing $10,000.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Do you have other sources of money where you could pay for the $4,000 without going into
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   debt?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Definitely. It would be taxable money, but yes.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Are you a scrupulous record keeper?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Yes.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Then in that case, my understanding is I don't see any downside for you to pursue the HSA
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   maximization strategy. So a quick little bit of background for listeners for whom this
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   may be coming out of the blue. The health savings account is a type of tax-advantaged
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   account that is available to people who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   They first came out, I think it was under the George W. Bush administration, under President
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Bush II, and it was part of the idea to lower the cost of health insurance by allowing people
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   to enroll in a high-deductible health plan and to fund some of their beginning medical
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   expenses with tax-advantaged dollars.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   What the people who study health insurance have found is when there's a zero cost for
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   going to the doctor, people are prone to go to the doctor just about any time. By zero,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I mean either literally zero or just a very low $15 or $30 copay. So people have a high
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   utilization for their medical providers, and they don't have much personal incentive to
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   shop around or to be more discerning with which doctor they call and when.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So in a high-deductible health plan, the idea was that we'll lower the cost of premiums
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   for a participant, and if somebody participates in that, then because their premiums are lower,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   they'll have a higher upfront deductible. So high-deductible health plans usually will
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   have at least about a $5,000 upfront deductible. And in order to meet those expenses, they
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   did two things. First, high-deductible health plans had to cover all preventive care. So
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   if you were just going in for a regular checkup or some other just preventive thing, that
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   would be covered without any out-of-pocket. And then secondly, it qualified you to participate
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   in a health savings account, which is an account that you can put money into pre-tax. And then
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   as long as you use the money to pay for your medical expenses, you will be able to pay
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   for those expenses without paying any income tax on the money. And so this became a fairly
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   popular account. And one of the great things about it is it can have a fairly high contribution
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   limit and is accessible to people without income qualification, but is accessible for
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   saving for their health expenses. The 2018 figures are for a single person. You can contribute
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   $3,450 to the account. And as a family, you can contribute $6,850 to the account. The
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   account also has an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 for those who are age 55 or older.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And as long as you use the money for qualified expenses, which would include any kind of
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   health expense, even including some things like long-term care expenses, then that money
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   could be received without any income taxes. Another useful wrinkle to the HSA was for
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   people who are enrolled in an HSA and for whom are enrolled as their employer, if the
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   employer is helping them make those contributions via a payroll deduction, they can actually
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   avoid the employment taxes on the contribution as well. So either way, if you're running
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   as an individual writing your own check into the account or as an employer, you can avoid
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   income taxes on the upfront contribution. But if you're enrolled through the context
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   of an employer, then you can avoid employment taxes. So for an employee, this can be a very
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   helpful account because it allows you to avoid the 7.65% employee contribution for your
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   employment taxes as well as the upfront contribution for your income taxes. The other benefit
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   of the account is if you don't use it for medical expenses, beginning at the age of
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   65, you can make distributions from the account and go ahead and pay taxes at that time.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So tax-wise, it functions in that context just like a traditional IRA. You don't receive
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   the money tax-free, you do receive the money on a tax-deferred basis. So this has come
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   out in the early retirement community as being a useful planning idea that's accessible
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   for people to help them save more money in tax-qualified accounts for their retirement.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And one of the ideas that has been discovered is in order to take your money out of the
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   accounts without paying current taxes, you don't have to do that in the year that you
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   have the expenses. And so the idea that Ruha is referencing here is if she can pay the
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   $4,000 of medical expenses now and just simply save those receipts, then perhaps when she
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   turns 50 and she retires early, and that's the year that she wants to take some tax-free
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   income, she can go ahead and use those receipts, which might be 20 years from now. I don't
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   know how old you are, Ruha, but I'm just making it up. Pretend that you're 20 years from
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   now. Then at that point in time, you can go ahead and use those receipts and take your
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   tax-free money out. So I don't see, as long as you can pay for the money, pay for the
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   expenses out of pocket without debt, I don't see any downside. You are still subject to
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   legislative risk. Could the Congress change the legislation on you? Could somehow this
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   loophole of your being able to not take the distribution in the year that you're earning,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   having the medical expense be eliminated? It's all possible. It's unlikely. I don't
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   think many people are doing this. I don't think it's a big—I haven't heard any musings
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   in the tax world. I doubt that Congress will ever be functional enough to make any substantial
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   changes to this. So I think that I don't see any downside to it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   OK. I actually was not aware that I could potentially save a $4,000 receipt from today
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and withdraw that 20 years from now. So that makes it an obvious answer.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So you were just thinking about it in the context of, "I'll take the money out as
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   a retirement benefit."
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Right.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   OK. So no, it's even better for you because, remember, you don't have to—so let me
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   clarify this because this is important. Let's pretend that that benefit did not exist. It
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   wouldn't matter whether you saved the receipt or had the expenses at all. You could never
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   incur that $4,000 cost. And then as long as you are age 65 or older when you take the
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   distribution from the HSA, you can take it out and spend it on anything. And you will
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   be taxed at your marginal tax rate at the time of distribution, but you won't incur
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   the penalty tax that you would have before 65. So you could take it out for either of
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   those—you could take it out when you wanted to. However, if you wanted to get the maximum
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   benefit from the tax-free growth of the account, then essentially what you could do is save
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   that $4,000 receipt. And then 30 years from now, then you go back and you say, "Here's
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   my $4,000 receipt," and now you go ahead and take that $4,000 out with no income taxes
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   because it's being used to pay for medical expenses. So it does work, but you're going
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   to have to be scrupulous with your record-keeping.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Makes sense. That's fantastic. Thank you so much.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   My pleasure. Any other questions today?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   No, sir.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   All right. Thanks for calling in, Ruha. We go next to David in California. David, welcome
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Hi, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   My pleasure.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I had trained for 10 years to become a church planning missionary overseas, and due to an
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   unexpected medical needs of one of my children, we had to return to the States, and that was
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   about a few years ago. And just ever since coming back, I've been struggling trying
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   to find a new direction, a new career path that I could just pursue. So I was wondering
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   what kind of advice you could give for finding a new direction after an unexpected life change.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   A friend of mine had said that you had mentioned in a previous episode about a personality
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   test that matches you with potential careers. So I was wondering if you remembered what
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   that was.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I'll give you a couple of options for that. First, though, how is your current financial
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   situation?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I would say it's stable. I have a job. I work in public education as an administrator
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   in the business office, and we have a $10,000 emergency fund. We're able to max out our
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   IRAs every year.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So financially, you came back from overseas, and now you're on a stable financial footing.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   You're currently employed; is that right?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Yes.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Okay. So you're currently employed. So here would be my question. Do you—and let's
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   start first with the choices that you were making previously—do you still intend to
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   be involved with the work of actively planting a church or churches?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   We have felt like if the Lord were to direct us clearly back overseas, then we would be
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   open to that. But for now, we feel like He's brought us—He has us where we are, pretty
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   obviously. And we are involved with our church and ministry in other ways, but not in full-time
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   vocational ministry.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And so previously, when you were overseas, you had solicited financial support, and you
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   were using that financial support from others to pay your expenses, and now—and so the
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   bifurcation that you're making here is that now you're not interested in pursuing that
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   path?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Not that I'm—we're not interested in it, but just that—I don't know. I don't
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   know what direction we're going in now.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Okay. So, the reason I'm asking about this is church planting and evangelization is deeply
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   important to me. Extremely important. I'm—I have a deep interest in the subject, and I'm
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   deeply interested in understanding how it can be progressed. So, I've studied this
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   topic quite a bit. I'm seeking to be as involved myself in any possible outlet that
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I see for that work of planting and strengthening churches. However, I don't, first and
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   foremost, make that a financial consideration. And I think that that's a bifurcation that
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   can be a little bit questionable. As far as I can tell, in my understanding of Scripture,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   in my understanding of God's plan for how the Church grows, each and every disciple
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   of Jesus must be involved in making other disciples. And that's just a simple—a
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   different way of approaching the topic of church planting.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Now, some people pursue the path of church planting in a very expensive way. I've
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   been to a couple of church planting conferences, I've interacted with a number of pastors
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   and books that are focused on this. And in the United States, there is often a very,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   very heavy cost that's associated with the work of church planting, especially the way
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   that it is frequently done in the U.S. American context. Frequently, the cost is in excess
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   of six figures, not even including the support for the individual person if they're pursuing
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   it on a full-time basis. But I think my opinion—and this would be fighting words in certain circles
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   with certain people—I think a lot of that is unnecessary. And I think that there are
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   ways to approach that work that don't involve saying, "Well, I have to make money. I have
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   to figure out how to start a church so I can get rich." All around the world, there are
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   a lot of people who pursue that. And I think that we're well-served by disconnecting
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   our financial needs from our work in the local church. I don't deny that churches should
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   support those people who are working in them. The Bible is crystal clear that a worker is
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   worthy of his wages, and so a person who's involved in working deserves financial support.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   However, I think that's a very dangerous place to be, because if you're ever dependent
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   on the local church or local churches for your financial support, that can quickly lead
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   to your having a temptation to make decisions with that in mind. I don't accuse all people
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   of doing that, but it's a big temptation. And there are a whole lot of pastors and preachers
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   who know that they should be preaching faithfully the conviction that they have, the clear biblical
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   doctrine that they believe, but in so doing, they know that they would lose their financial
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   support from the local church, and thus they keep their mouths quiet. The best way I know
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to protect against that is to never put yourself in a position where you're financially dependent
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   upon the local church. That allows you the freedom to speak clearly without having their
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   financial interests mixed up. Now, why is this so important? Because if you're going
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   to be involved in the work of actively discipling others, actively encouraging the growth of
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   your local church, actively involved in that, then you have to structure your life and your
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   business in ways that are going to take that into account. And here's where you have to
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   take a careful inventory of what your burden is that you feel before God with your actual
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   work. If you feel that God wants you to be primarily involved, you feel a deep conviction
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   or impression that you are to be primarily involved with the work in your local church,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and if you have an idea of what that context that looks like, you may make career decisions
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   that don't fall into the traditional, normal, current-day U.S. American self-fulfillment
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   approach. For example, you might put yourself in a situation where your work is something
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   that's done early in the morning. Years ago, I worked with a man who, for years, his means
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   of support, he was engaged in what most people would call full-time missions, but for years
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   his form of support was to deliver newspapers, back when that was a slightly more lucrative
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and normal occupation with a higher demand. But that allowed him to get up and go to work
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   at 3 o'clock in the morning, and then he would be done and have his day free for interaction
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   with others. And so you might make a choice like that. You might choose to engage in an
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   occupation that doesn't give you a great degree of, perhaps, self-fulfillment, because it
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   frees you up for something else. And that's a reference point that's frequently not going
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   to be included in any of the personality tests or things that I'm about to give you. Likewise,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   you may pursue some entrepreneurial endeavor, and you may make an intentional choice that
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   it's not going to be so financially productive. You might do something that allows you to
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   work, but you know that if you worked more hours at that occupation, you could make a
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   lot more money, but you choose to invest those hours elsewhere because of the burden and
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   calling that you feel. If you do that, then that's not going to fit well into the personality
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   profiles. So I'll give you a couple of ideas of personality profiles in just a minute,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   but I would encourage you to think seriously about that and to try to understand what burden
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   you and your wife currently feel, what you currently sense is God's direction for your
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   life at this point in time. I don't think it necessarily has to be one or the other.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I think that--and here's where, if we go any farther with this topic, we would venture
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   off of the world of personal finance. I guess I would just say that I think that the way
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   that--without knowing what background you're involved in, I think that the way that many
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   church organizations approach the process of church planting is simply unsustainable.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   It's unsustainable because it places too much pressure on one individual man to carry a
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   load that God never designed for one individual man to carry. And I think especially when
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   you involve finances in it, it leads to a great heavy, heavy burden on one man. And
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I'll leave you with one quote and an allusion to somebody who actually has some credentials
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   in the world of church planting. I have been--I've been trying to--I've studied a number of
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   different church planting movements around the world. One of the ones that has most interested
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   me has been the work of David Watson. Without--are you familiar with that name, David?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   No, no.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Okay, so David Watson, very concisely with his story, he was a--he was an international
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   missionary who was sent out originally by the Southern Baptist denomination, I think,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and he had been a very successful missionary in Asia until he was sent to India, to I believe
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Southern India. And while he was in Southern India, he faced total disaster. He--it was
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   a very cold climate for the advance of the Christian gospel. He was, I think, four, three,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   four, five, a number of his entire--all of his mission--his ministry team that he was
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   working with at that time and his work there in Southern India were killed by the local
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   people. He was--he and his wife and his family were ejected from the country by the Indian
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   government and he, in that context, he went back to Hong Kong as a failed missionary now
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   with his entire ministry team killed and him as a failed missionary without anything to
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   show. And it really put him through the wringer, and this was 20, 30 years ago, I think. This
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   really put him through the wringer personally and he tried to figure out what on earth is
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   going on. So, he wrestled with the Lord for months, seeking to get out of the call that
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   he felt he had on his life, and then he never received any kind of permission or release
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   from that context. So, he said, "Well, if we're going to do this, we've got to do this
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   differently." And so, he went through the scriptures with a different view in mind and
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   looking for what wisdom is there from the Bible on how to approach this work of church
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   planting. And the reason it's important is, sometime later, a year or so later, he began
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   again his work in southern India. And proceeding quickly through the story, he--the first year
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   they planted something like zero churches, and then the next year, you know, he was sending
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   these reports back to his denominational board, you know, one church, two churches. But five
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   years in, they reported back that they had planted a thousand churches that year. And
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   so, the denominational board was, of course, suspicious that he was making these numbers
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   up. They came out for an audit of the work that he was doing and found that they had
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   actually understated the number of churches. And so, the reason this is important is, over
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   the last 20 years, David Watson and others--other organizations involved have planted hundreds
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   of thousands of churches throughout the world. And this is a world that I would assume that
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   we're a little bit plugged into, but most U.S. Americans have no context of how fast
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   the Christian church is growing on an international basis, because we look at the U.S. American
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   context, where all of the mainline liberal Protestant denominations are in collapse.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   But on a global basis, Christianity is growing by leaps and bounds. And you can trace--there's
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   a--there's good academic study on what's happening as far as these what are called
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   contagious disciple-making movements. So, he wrote a book called Contagious Disciple-Making
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   by David Watson. I would encourage you to get it and to read it. But one of the things
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   that he has done, and he's an elusive figure to find, but you can find some of his teaching,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and one of the things that they noted on the work that they have involved, that they did
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   in planting hundreds of thousands of churches, they found that on a global basis, anytime
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   the church built a building, and anytime they started paying a pastor, then the growth always
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   stopped. Because instead of putting the advance of the gospel first and foremost, then it
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   develops in the pastors who were involved this idea of stability, and it stops the growth,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   it stops the advance. And so, they've learned over the years to never--to always discourage
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   the building of a building, and always discourage the paying of a pastor. And so, what's the
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   point? The point is that when somebody is devoted to their work, and it's not for their
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   own pecuniary interest, that it changes the whole dynamic. Now, I do not deny, and this
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   is why I'm affirming this, we have clear biblical support to say that the Bible says Jesus taught--is
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   it Jesus or Paul? The Bible says that the preacher of the gospel is worthy of his wages.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   So, those who preach the gospel should make their living by the gospel. So, there is no
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   denying that somebody who's diligently involved in the preaching of the gospel should be paid
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   for that work. However, when that pay is first and foremost, it seems to totally change the
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   dimension. And I think I would commend to you the study of the examples that we have
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   from the preachers of the gospel in the actual New Testament, and look to see what worked
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and how did they do it. Now, let's go back to practicality. The point is that that work,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   if you're going to be involved in one local church, depending on the expression of that,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   if it's a small local working, that shouldn't need 50 hours of your week. And that's why
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   one of the big growths within the U.S. American context is in the context of bivocational
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   pastors. And that's really a model that I would commend to you to consider, because
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   if you feel a burden or a call to be involved with church planting, then taking a personality
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   profile, doing a Myers-Briggs here, is not going to change that. And frequently what
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   you will find is if that burden is strong on your heart, you will have to approach it
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   and say, "What's going to support me and allow me to do this other work?" Not so much, "What's
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   going to be the most fulfilling?" So that was a very long preamble to, let me give you
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   some personality tests that may help you. Any questions before I go on?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   No.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Okay. So here are, there are four personality profiles that each have their own unique attributes.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   One is well known, it's the Myers-Briggs. That one is probably the most famous of the
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   personality profiles. And in the Myers-Briggs context, I'm just going to give you the names
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and you can read about them. And also what I'll do for you, David, is I actually have
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   a whole segment on this in the career and income course that I have been teaching and
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   been updating. I'll privately, separately get your info and I'll just enroll you in
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   that course in case it can be helpful to you at this transition stage.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Great.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   But the four that are important is one is Myers-Briggs, two is Colby, three is StrengthsFinder,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and four is the DISC personality profile. Now where I would start, the one of those
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   that I think is the most practical for your career questions is the DISC profile that's
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   sold by Dan Miller at 48days.com. He sells this, and my understanding of the DISC profile
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   is that it's drawn a little bit with influence on the Myers-Briggs test. But what he sells
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   at 48days.com is a product that is explicitly focused on career choice. It's a simple test,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   but it gives you kind of a little bit of your personality profile and gives you some potential
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   careers. Of all of the ones that I have done, and actually in preparing for the course over
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   the years, I've taken a lot of these personality profiles, and then in preparing for the course
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that I have been teaching, I took several more. But of all of these that I have done,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   the DISC is right to the point. And I was shocked when I actually looked at all of the
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   things that it spat out to me, and I realized that something like 70% of the specific jobs
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   that had been encouraged for me to pursue were things that I had either pursued in the
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   past and enjoyed or were on my list purely from me thinking about things that I would
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   be well qualified for to pursue. And so if you were only going to do one, do that one.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I don't remember how much you charge for it. It's pretty cheap, $20, $30, but it's well
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   worth it. Do the DISC personality profile at 48days.com. And if you'll stay on until I
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   finish recording the show, I'll get your info and enroll you in my course for free, and
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   hopefully that'll help you. Anything else? Any other questions? Any clarification needed
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   on any of that? No, I don't think so. That's great, thank you. I will hang on until the
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   end. And do yourself a favor and read David Watson's book called Contagious Disciplemaking.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And--let me just confirm that. Yeah, it's Contagious Disciplemaking. Looks like he's
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   got a website built up. And they've been working in the United States as well. But on a global
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   basis, they've been doing some really good work, and it's well worth being aware of it.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And I went to, a couple years ago, I went to a big church planning conference that was
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   in Orlando. And I guess the thing that I would say is I appreciated so much of the work that
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   many preachers are involved in. But man, if you have to spend six figures and figure out
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   how to get supported for multiple years to establish a local church, that is utterly
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   unsustainable. That just can't work for the growth that's necessary. But there are a lot
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   of people who are involved in other expressions that it just doesn't involve that big of a
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   financial cost. I'll link to the book in the show notes today as well. Jared in Arkansas,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   how can I serve you today, sir? Oh, hello, Joshua. Thanks for taking the time to answer
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   my question. I recently began working for a company that offers a non-qualified deferred
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   comp plan. And because I'm considered a highly compensated employee, I'm very limited in
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   what I can contribute to the 401(k), which makes this account that much more important.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   In the past, I've only had access to typical retirement accounts like 457s, 401(a)s. So
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   this type of account is very new to me. Really, I'm interested in what your thought process
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   would be in determining how this tool should be used, kind of an overall financial plan
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   towards trying to gain financial independence, given that it's a fairly complex, at least
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   to me, complex type of account and there's inherent risk associated with the funds that
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   you invest because it's non-qualified. Right. Tell me a little bit more about your understanding
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   of what's available to you, the terms, the investment options, etc. Yeah, so the investment
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   options are pretty good. They are fairly low fees, you know, typical index type funds you're
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   able to invest in. Where it gets complex for me is that basically you have to determine
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   each year the percent of your income and bonuses that go into the account. But at that time,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   you also determine disbursement. Basically, you can have the funds disperse up to 15 years
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   after you separate employment, which could be a year from now, could be at retirement.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   But you have to determine where your money is going, how much and how you want it dispersed
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   when you separate. But then the account is non-qualified, which to me means that basically
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   if a company were to go bankrupt, my investment assets would be considered an asset of the
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   company. That's right. So you are supposed to choose a percentage of your income to designate
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   to the account. Does your employer put additional contribution in there for you or they're just
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   simply saying, "Yes, you can defer some of your income in here"? No, there's a small
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   match of 2.5%. Okay. So then you're investing into mainstream mutual funds, index funds,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   things like that. And then how is the distribution schedule determined? So each year that I decide
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   where my money from the next calendar year is going to go, I determine based on the separation
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   date when the funds will be distributed. They're done in annual equal installments based on
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   the schedule I pick each year. So the limit is 15. So say this past year, when I elect
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   the percent of income that's going into the account, I also determine if I could get the
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   money in one lump sum, the January after I separate employment, or I could spread that
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   out up to, in annual increments, up to 15 years, meaning they'll just divide my contribution
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and growth into annual payments that will be sent to me over that 15-year time period.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Do you remember any names that were referred to in the paperwork for this type of plan?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Was it called anything other than a non-qualified deferred compensation program?
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   No. Basically, they titled it an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, and it's through
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   a company called PenCal. Right. So let me answer your, well, let's talk about your situation
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   first, and then I'll go through a little bit of what is specific to you. First, is there
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   any reason for you not to participate? No. I mean, I have the funds available. I'm
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   using it as a tool to basically defer taxes. No, I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   participate. The company is very, it's about a 30, 40-year-old company. It's very stable.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I don't, it was kind of a follow-up question I was going to have, is how to determine the
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   stability of the company and whether or not there's a risk of bankruptcy in the future.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   But from the information that's available to me, it's a very stable company, and I have
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   the funds for me to contribute to the account. Have you asked the plan representative how
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   safe the assets are in terms of claims on the company's assets?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   No, I haven't asked the question. In the document, basically, it just states that it is a non-qualified
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   account, and if the company were to go bankrupt, it is, you know, your assets are a part of
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   the overall company assets. They do have, I think maybe it's a rabbi trust.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I was just going to ask that. Are the assets held in a rabbi trust?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Yes, they are.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Okay. All right. So let me give, let me answer your question and then just give a little
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   bit of commentary for the audience to understand in case this is a new question for them. If
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   there's no reason for you not to participate, and the only reasons that come to mind that
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   are the most important ones is, one, do you have the money? Do you need the money? Right?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   You've said, "No, I have the money. I'm able to participate in it and contribute to it."
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Two would be, do you have a better use for the money? So maybe you have some brilliant
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   investment idea that you do out of your kitchen at home. In that case, putting money into
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   index funds, well, what does that help me? I don't need any more money in index funds.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I need to do this brilliant investment opportunity that I'm working on in my kitchen. So if you
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   don't have a better use for the money, then there's not any reason to participate. And
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   then the third thing comes involved with the financial stability of the company and the
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   protection of those assets. So here's where we need to specify what is the difference
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   between a qualified deferred compensation plan and a non-qualified deferred compensation
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   plan. A qualified deferred compensation, most of the retirement plans that we're used to
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   talking about in the United States with regard to the nomenclature that we use, a 401(k),
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   a 403(b), etc., these are all qualified plans, which means that they are tax qualified, which
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   means that they follow the law related to ERISA, E-R-I-S-A, the Employee Retirement
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Income Security Act, if my acronym is correct. And so because of a plan being qualified according
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   to ERISA, there are certain requirements that must be met. So for example, you said that
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   you are a highly compensated employee. Well, under ERISA, a qualified plan may not discriminate
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   among employees and may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. So
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   when you sit down and look at a roster of people who are involved in a company, then
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   you have to meet certain testing limits as far as participation rates and the incomes
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   of the people who are involved. And if you're a highly compensated employee, sometimes you
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   may not have enough of your employees who participate in a plan in order for it to meet
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   the non-discrimination testing rates. Now, there are ways for a company to get around
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   the non-discrimination testing rates. So for example, they'll establish what's called a
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   safe harbor plan, where they make a standard contribution of additional amount of income
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   for each employee, and that allows the highly compensated employees to participate. But
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   sometimes this can work out well and sometimes it can't work out well, and it all has to
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   do with the structure of the company. Is the company the type where a qualified plan works
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   and do the people like it? By the way, Jared, do you also have access to a qualified plan?
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Does your company offer one to other employees as well?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Yeah, so there's a 401k. We have a typical 401k, but because I'm a highly qualified employee,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   I can only put in 3% to that account. But yeah, the rest of the workforce does.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And is that because you don't have a high enough participation rate from the other employees?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Yeah, I don't know. I don't know that they would give me that information if I asked.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Okay. It should be no problem as far as to understand, but it's immaterial for this discussion.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   So a qualified plan cannot discriminate among employees. All employees have to be able to
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   participate after their eligibility. There can be a vesting schedule, but those vesting schedules
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   are limited, etc. So you basically can't discriminate among employees in favor of the highly
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   qualified employees. A qualified plan must satisfy all of the ERISA requirements regarding
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   reporting, regarding plan design, etc. When somebody participates in a qualified plan,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   they do have the opportunity to take an immediate tax deduction for their contribution. So this
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   is why you can defer money into your 401k plan and you can take your immediate tax deduction
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   that's because it's a qualified plan. And then in a qualified plan, the earnings, the growth,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   the interest, those earnings on your accounts can accrue tax deferred until they are
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   distributed from the plan. And then when they're distributed at the plan, then of course
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   they're usually taxed to you at an ordinary rate, such as a 401k. Now you can get these
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   things mixed up a little bit. And here's where the common personal finance nomenclature
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   that we use conflicts a little bit with technical personal fin-- sorry, technical financial
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   planning nomenclature. For example, a 401k plan is actually simply a form of deferred
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   compensation, which allows the employee to make contributions to the account. So your
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   employer could set up a deferred compensation program for you that didn't permit you to
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   make contributions, but usually they do, and that's what's called a 401k plan. But people
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   often-- this distinction is important because people often get bent out of shape when
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   there are some companies that don't allow you to take distributions from your 401k plan.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   There are some companies that don't have loan provisions available for your 401k plan.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And it's important that people know that it's a matter of how the account is written and
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   what the plan design actually is. Now there has emerged to be a fairly standardized approach.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Most 401k plans allow loan provisions. Some 401k plans allow in-service distributions.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And so there has developed a fairly standardized approach, but that's because the
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   benefits industry has tried to seek what has been the most helpful for people. Now,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   back to the point, a couple more comments, and then we'll-- I'll try to finish with your
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   specific question. Now, a non-qualified plan doesn't meet those requirements. And it's
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   called non-qualified because it doesn't match the ERISA law, but it still can have
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   certain benefits. So for example, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan can
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   discriminate among employees. You don't have to offer everyone access to the same plan.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   You can choose to offer plans to all of your key employees or to your highly compensated
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   employees or to your management employees. An employer could offer an individual plan
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   to one person. They can discriminate in favor of any person that they want to
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   discriminate with. So your employer could come to you and say, "You are our key
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   salesman. You produce millions of dollars of revenue for you. Here's what I want to
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   offer you. I want to offer you a unique plan. I'll give you extra compensation if you
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   follow these certain rules. You stay with us for a certain amount of time. You engage
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   in these certain activities." It can be written with a wide degree of flexibility.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   It's exempt from all of those ERISA requirements, and so it allows the employee
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   and the employer to come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. And so this
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   would be where if you were the CEO of a large publicly traded company, you would
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   have your salary, but your ability to contribute to a 401(k) plan is meaningless,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   but you would go ahead and have a unique retirement plan negotiated in your
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   contract that pays you out a million dollars a year under certain language.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Now, you give up a good bit of the benefits that you have with a qualified plan to
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   buy a non-qualified plan. So for example, in a non-qualified plan, you aren't
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   allowed to take a tax deduction for any contributions on the account until it's
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   actually available. Or those fund earnings, and this is where the big danger comes
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   in, those earnings, the account has to be available to as an asset of the company.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   If your company, if you're participating in a qualified plan and you've got a
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   million dollars in your 401(k), your company goes into bankruptcy, that million
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   dollars in your 401(k) is not available to the creditors of the company. That
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   million dollars in your 401(k) will be safe. It will not be affected by the
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   bankruptcy of the company. However, if your company has a million dollars in a
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   non-qualified contribution plan, then you may have a problem because that amount
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   of money has to be kept as an asset of the company. Now, the term that you
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   mention of a "rabbi trust" is important, and it's called a rabbi trust because
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   one of the early, the ruling that allowed for this doctrine, I think it was a
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   special plan that had been set up between a Jewish rabbi and the congregation that
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   was employing him. And so in the rabbi trust, it allows for a slight separation
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   of assets from the assets of the company. Now, the asset in a rabbi trust, it has
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   to be available to the general creditors of the company if that company files for
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   bankruptcy or otherwise becomes insolvent for some reason. And so it's not fully
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   protected. You can't have greater rights in the asset than the unsecured creditors
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   of the company. It has to have clear rules describing when the benefits will be
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   paid, and the company has to notify the trustee of any bankruptcy or financial
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   hardship that the company is undergoing so that you would know that if a
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   bankruptcy or financial hardship is occurring, then the trustee can start to
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   make factors for you. But it doesn't provide protection against the bankruptcy
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   of the company. And so that's where, I'm getting so deep here. Let me just wrap it
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   up with this. There's no reason not to participate. If the company is on a good
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   setting, there's no reason not to participate. They've got this incentivized
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   for you to incentivize you to stay with them for a longer period of time. But you
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   do need to ask questions and read what the actual plan is and make sure that you
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   understand it. And take these questions back to HR. And the biggest advice I would
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   give you, if this is your first time participating in a non-qualified deferred
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   compensation program, read the terms carefully, understand it, and ask these
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   questions to your HR representative. I can't know what's in there because they
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   can be customized. You can build a non-qualified deferred compensation
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   program that's just for one individual. And so it's not as easy for someone like
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   me to answer about it. But what you want to ask is, what are the terms under which
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I would lose the account? What are the terms under which my money is available
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   for the claims of the creditors? What's the financial position of the company?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And what are the tax implications for me? And if you just ask those questions and
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   make sure that you understand, then you can decide for yourself if it will be
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   helpful to you. We got really deep there, but is that enough to at least give you
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   a good start, Jared?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Oh, absolutely. That list of questions is incredibly helpful. Thank you.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Absolutely. It's a good move. I don't see any reason not to participate in a
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   non-qualified plan. Non-qualified plans, you want to just make sure you
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   understand what it's funded with so that you can work that into your overall plan.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   It sounds like your plan is funded with stocks, with mutual funds. That's good.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Frequently, these plans are funded with life insurance policies. That can be
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   helpful. There's a whole other wrinkle with that. The reason they're frequently
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   funded with life insurance policies is because the inside buildup of cash value
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   in life insurance policies are exempt from that annual tax growth. And it also
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   provides some stability and security for the pension payments if you have a
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   defined benefit program that's structured with life insurance. There are a few
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   life insurance companies and life insurance advisors who exclusively focus on
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   selling life insurance policies with this particular structure. It doesn't sound
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   like you have that here. Just ask questions and understand it. And basically,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   what you want to be aware of is what could go wrong that could harm me. And the
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   most important thing is that you know that just because the assets are there in
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   your account, you don't actually have the money until it's paid out to you. It's
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   still an asset of the company that can be invaded if the company faces financial
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   insolvency or bankruptcy. So understand that and then take advantage of what you
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   got. Thank you all so much for listening to today's show. If you would like to
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   join me on a future Q&A show, I'd love for you to do that. Again, safest way I do
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   this, I mean, last time I did one of these calls for the email list was probably
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   eight months ago. So your best way if you'd like to get on a call today is to go
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron. Sign up to support the show there. And I
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   would love to have you on next week's call. RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Have a great weekend, everybody.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Thank you for listening. You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   grateful for that. And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   ideas and strategies and tactics and techniques and tools that will help move
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   you towards your goals. Before you go, three simple requests. One, if there's an
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take action on it.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   automatically lead to a life change. It's action that leads to a life change. So
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   take action. Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   it with somebody that you care about. I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   me in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share. That helps
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   your learning. Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and if you're gaining financial benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   grateful if you'd consider paying me for this work voluntarily. Come by
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and you can sign up there to support the show
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   at whatever level you feel is right for you. This is a voluntary support. That's
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   my Patreon page. You can support me with $1 a month, $5 a month, $10 a month, any
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   number that seems right to you. But if you're gaining financial benefit from
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   this show and if it's achieving financial results in your life, I'd be grateful
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   for your financial support at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
