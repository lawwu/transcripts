[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   What an incredible weekend. Friday we celebrated the cross of Christ.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Sunday we celebrated the resurrection of Christ. And now it's Easter evening when this episode officially launches online.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And I love Easter more than any other date in the church calendar, even more than Christmas, to be honest.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   That move from the cross to the resurrection is just so stark, so stunning.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And it leads to a question from a listener named Becca.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Hi, Pastor John. I hope you and your family enjoyed the beauty of Christ this Easter season.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I have benefited greatly from all your teachings and the wisdom at Desiring God.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I'm a young believer devoted to following Christ daily for the last four years.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   For me, each Easter gets richer and richer as I have a more mature understanding and a deeper revelation of the power of the cross.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   But I'm also coming to the conclusion that, knowing the frailties of my own humanity,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I cannot sustain the beauty and the works of the cross and the crucifixion I experienced in a weekend like this one on a daily basis.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This frustrates me.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Easter Monday, I'm left dry, feeling almost lifeless and numb to everything I just celebrated,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   lured back into my brainless media like social media and movies and TV, back to reality, I think to myself.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Is this feeling normal?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Or how does the cross and resurrection I celebrated this weekend change my life on Monday?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   What do I take from Easter Sunday into my Monday morning?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Becca?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   The first thing I want to say is that it is biblical and good to think of corporate worship on Sunday as a God-designed weekly high,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   high point in your spiritual life.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It ought to be something that can't be replicated during the week.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Can't be replicated by yourself, can't be replicated in a small group.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Individual experiences of Christ and small group experiences of Christ are essential to our walk with God.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   But Sunday corporate worship under the preached word in the power of the Holy Spirit with Spirit-filled singing of God's people gathered
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   is meant to be an extraordinary work of God in our lives.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So the point of that is, for Becca, don't assume a decrease of that experience is a bad thing.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I mean, he meant it to be special.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He meant it to be unusually powerful, and that's good.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So just be sure you're not setting up artificial expectations for Monday morning as though they should reproduce Sunday morning,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   because they shouldn't.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Sunday morning is not Monday morning.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It is the gathered people of God under the preached word in the Spirit singing, "Oh, my, it's glorious."
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   The things that he's done for me over the years that aren't done any other way,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and the way I meet God in those times meet him like no other time,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   even though I love my personal devotions and I love my small group.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So Becca asked, you asked Becca, if the feeling is normal to be, quote, "left dry, lifeless, numb on Monday
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   after experiencing the glories of the risen Christ on Sunday."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Well, Jesus' answer to that question is, for a pretty large percentage of people, it is normal, but it ought not to be.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And I'm basing that on the parable of the four soils.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Remember that one?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   The devil comes, the word is delivered, and then the devil comes.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Let's say he comes on Monday morning, maybe Sunday night.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The devil comes and snatches away the word from the heart, and then there's this other soil where we hear the word of God with joy,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and we have no root, and flourish for a little while, maybe till Wednesday, and bang, it's gone.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   The word is gone, choked out or burned up.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And then the third soil is the cares and the riches and the pleasures of life choke out the word,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and it doesn't bear any fruit.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And then the fourth soil is like 25% of the hearers hear the word of God, hold it fast in an honest and good heart,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and bear fruit with patience.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So for three-fourths of the people in this parable--and I don't want to make any claim at all that that's typical of any given church on any Sunday morning,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I'm just pointing out that normalcy isn't necessarily a good thing.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So for three-fourths of the people in the parable, Sunday morning doesn't last beyond Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   That makes it pretty normal and pretty scary.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So here's what she's really asking.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So here's my main exhortation and then three minor exhortations.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So the big main exhortation is this.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Becca and all the rest of us who share her life, be sure that the spiritual high that you experience on Sunday is a truth high,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   not merely a music high or a friend high.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Be sure it's a truth high.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   In other words, as you are singing, reading Scripture, listening to a sermon, make yourself focus on the truth that you are loving.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   What truths about God, what truths about Christ and his ways and his work, his promises, are especially stirring your heart with joy and trust and hope.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And then later on Sunday afternoon, perhaps, write these truths down.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Keep a notebook.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Maybe you call it "My Truth High Notebook."
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   One or two or three beautiful things about God, his ways, that was given you in the service on Sunday morning.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And the reason this is so important is because if the emotional high, and believe me, I got no problem with emotional highs.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I believe in emotional highs if they're truth highs.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Got it?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   If the emotion is rooted in truth.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So if they're not rooted in truth, they're going to be like these air plants that don't go anywhere.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   They just hang there.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   A normal plant that ought to have roots would just not survive in the air.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So Monday morning, if you can't recite to yourself and preach to yourself in the power of the Spirit the truths from Sunday,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   it's no surprise that the effects of the truths won't be there either.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So that's my main exhortation.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Be sure that the Sunday morning high is a truth high.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Write down those truths and you can rehearse them to yourself through the week.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Now here are my three minor encouragements how to nurture the truth high for the sake of significant joy,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   if not the same Sunday morning joy, all through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Number one, pray for your heart.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Pray it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Pray for the inclination of your heart.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Pray for the eyes of your heart.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Pray for the taste of your heart.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's Psalm 119, verse 36, Ephesians 1, verse 17, 1 Peter 2, verses 2 and 3.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   The inclination, the eyes, and the taste of your heart.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Many people are fatalistic about the state of their hearts, as if there's nothing that can be done about a numb heart.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Like, "Oh, I got a numb heart.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Que sera, sera.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I'm cursed with a numb heart."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   No!
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   The Bible presents a very different picture than being fatalistic.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It presents an aggressive pursuit of God's help for the inclination of your heart,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   and for the seeing of your heart, and for the taste of your heart, seeing the heart.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Don't settle for anything less than God's intervention to incline your heart, illumine your heart, sweeten your heart.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's God's work.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   He does it in answer to prayer.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So that's my first subordinate exhortation.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Pray for your heart.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Number two, use Bible regimen, yes, and ransacking.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Bible ransacking.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Have a regimen of Bible reading every morning, but add to the regimen ransacking.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Regimens are essential.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I believe they're essential.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   But that's not the only way to handle the Bible.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   The Bible is a gold mine.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It's a fountain of life.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It's a sweet honey.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   It's a vine where you can pick grapes and satisfy your hunger and your thirst.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's just full of encouragement and steadfastness.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But sometimes the regimen we have doesn't lead us to the places where that happens.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So on those mornings, we need to add to regimen ransacking.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   In other words, flip through the Bible.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I've got to find a promise.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And you look for something you've underlined in years gone by, or something that meant much yesterday,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   or you've got to ransack this book until you find something sweet and precious and valuable
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   that you can roll around on the tongue of your soul all day long.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So that's exhortation number two, add to regimen ransacking.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And the last one is replace spiritual squelchers with spiritual sustainers.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Becca, you referred to your own spiritual squelchers.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   You're not a dummy.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   You know what they are.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You told me what they are.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You said, "My brainless media, like social media and movies and TV."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Those are your words, not mine.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Well, well, well, well, if you know where the poison ivy is, don't walk through it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   We're grownups.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Replace poison ivy with flowers that smell good and grapevines that hang along the way with sweet grapes.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I'll mention two squelch-avoiding sustainers.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   One, hanging out with godly people.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Two, generously giving your time and effort to some worthy service.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Because we all know that we tend to pick up the enthusiasms of others,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and we all know that it's more blessed to give than to receive,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and blessedness is what we are eager for.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So here's my summary.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   One, rejoice that corporate worship is unique, special, glorious.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Can't imitate it on Monday, even if Monday has its own way of being wonderful.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Two, don't be among the three-fourths who let the word be burned up, choked out, snatched away.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Three, be sure that the spiritual high Sunday morning is a truth high, not a music high or a social high.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Four, then nurture the truth roots by earnestly praying for your heart's inclination,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   eyes, taste, and finally by adding Bible ransacking to Bible regimen and replacing squelchers with sustainers.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Amen. Yeah, that's really good counsel for us moving from Easter Sunday back into our Monday routines.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Really helpful counsel for every Monday morning, really. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And thank you for listening to this episode.

[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Well, I want Christ to be the treasure of my life.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   In fact, I often find the wanting of him to be my treasure a more common reality in my life
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   than the actual act of treasuring and enjoying him as my treasure.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Is that normative? It's a great question.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It comes from you, comes frequently from you in the inbox.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I'll ask it to Pastor John next time.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
