[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.000]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.560]   Today, my guest is Dr. Charles Zucker.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.720]   Dr. Zucker is a professor of biochemistry
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.320]   and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.160]   at Columbia University School of Medicine.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.680]   Dr. Zucker is one of the world's leading experts
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.900]   in perception.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.940]   That is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.220]   in the world into events within the nervous system
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.360]   that we come to understand as our sense of smell,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.520]   our sense of taste, our sense of vision,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.080]   our sense of touch, and our sense of hearing.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   Dr. Zucker's lab is responsible for a tremendous amount
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.960]   of pioneering and groundbreaking work
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.040]   in the area of perception.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.140]   For a long time, his laboratory worked on vision,
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.640]   defining the very receptors that allow
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.520]   for the conversion of light into signals
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.620]   that the rest of the eye and the brain can understand.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.980]   In recent years, his laboratory has focused mainly
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.580]   on the perception of taste.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.340]   And indeed, his laboratory is responsible
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.020]   for discovering many of the taste receptors,
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.040]   leading to our perception of things like sweetness,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.420]   sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami,
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.700]   that is savoriness in food.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.660]   Dr. Zucker's laboratory is also responsible
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.620]   for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.320]   That is how the nervous system determines whether or not
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.500]   we should ingest more fluid or reject fluids
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.900]   that are offered to us.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.620]   A key feature of the work from Dr. Zucker's laboratory
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.140]   is that it bridges the brain and body.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.300]   As you'll soon learn from today's discussion,
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.860]   his laboratory has discovered a unique set
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.380]   of sugar-sensing neurons that exist,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.860]   not just within the brain, but a separate set of neurons
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.900]   that sense sweetness and sugar within the body.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.120]   And that much of the communication between the brain
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   and body leading to our seeking of sugar
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.820]   is below our conscious detection.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.560]   Dr. Zucker has received a large number of prestigious awards
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.840]   and appointments as a consequence
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.880]   of his discoveries in neuroscience.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.220]   He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.600]   the National Academy of Medicine,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.300]   and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.620]   He is also an investigator
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.840]   with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.300]   For those of you that are not familiar
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.380]   with the so-called HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.420]   Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.420]   are selected on an extremely competitive basis.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.080]   And indeed, they have to come back every five years
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.360]   as Howard Hughes investigators.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.980]   Dr. Zucker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 1989.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.500]   What all that means for you as a viewer
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.580]   and/or listener of today's podcast
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.320]   is that you are about to learn about the nervous system
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.400]   and its ability to create perceptions,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   in particular, the perception of taste and sugar-sensing
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.000]   from the world's expert on perception and taste.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.560]   I'm certain that by the end of today's podcast,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.600]   you're not just going to come away
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.660]   with a deeper understanding of our perceptions
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.860]   and our perception of taste in particular,
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.300]   but indeed, you will come away with an understanding
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.040]   of how we create internal representations
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.140]   of the entire world around us.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.460]   And in doing so,
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.200]   how we come to understand our life experience.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.060]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.380]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.860]   We often talk about supplements on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.080]   and while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.220]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.000]   for things like enhancing the quality and speed
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.560]   with which you get into sleep,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.580]   or for enhancing focus, or for hormone support.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.380]   The reason we partnered with Momentous Supplements
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.220]   is several fold.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.200]   First of all, their supplements
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.960]   are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.200]   Second of all, they ship internationally,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.680]   which is important because many of our podcast listeners
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   reside outside the US.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.160]   Third, many of the supplements that Momentous makes
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.720]   and most all of the supplements
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.560]   that we partnered with them directly on
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.680]   are single ingredient formulations.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.160]   This is important for a number of reasons.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.380]   First of all, if you're going to create a supplement protocol
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.280]   that's customized for your needs,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.520]   you want to be able to figure out
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   which supplement ingredients are most essential
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.640]   and only use those.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   And supplements that combine lots of ingredients
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.460]   simply won't allow you to do that.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.720]   So in trying to put together a supplement protocol
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.320]   for yourself that's the most biologically effective
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.000]   and cost-effective, single ingredient formulations
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.380]   are going to be the most useful.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.520]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.280]   that we partnered with Momentous on,
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.240]   you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.380]   And there you'll see many of the supplements
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.800]   that we've talked repeatedly about
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.080]   on the Huberman Lab podcast episodes.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.520]   I should mention that the catalog of supplements
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.160]   that are available at livemomentous.com/huberman
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.940]   is constantly being expanded.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.280]   So you can check back there livemomentous.com/huberman
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.040]   to see what's currently available.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.240]   And from time to time,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.820]   you'll notice new supplements being added to the inventory.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.340]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.100]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.080]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.620]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.220]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.260]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.000]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.980]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.220]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.700]   And for frequent listeners of this podcast,
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.360]   you may remember that I'm not a big fan
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.080]   of the word nootropics because the word nootropics
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.060]   means smart drugs or smart compound.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.580]   And the reason I don't like that phrase
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.640]   is that the brain has many different circuits that it uses
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.700]   in order to perform things like focus or task switching
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.980]   or creativity.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.980]   So the idea that there's a single thing
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.660]   that we would call a smart drug
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.980]   is simply not in concert with the biology.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.700]   Well, Thesus understands this,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.460]   and as a consequence has developed
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.240]   custom nootropic formulations
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.460]   that are tailored to your unique needs.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.580]   So for instance,
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.660]   Thesus will allow you to try different blends
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.300]   over the course of a month and determine which blends
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.060]   of specific ingredients work best for you to focus
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.540]   or for you to gain motivation and energy for workouts
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.260]   or for cognitive work of some sort.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.860]   I've been using Thesus custom nootropics
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.700]   for well over six months now,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.380]   and they completely transformed the way
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.500]   that I do cognitive work
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.620]   and indeed the way that I do physical fitness.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.460]   If you want to try
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.220]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.540]   you can go online to takethesus.com/huberman.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.660]   There, you'll just do a brief three minute quiz
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.640]   and Thesus will send you four different formulas
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.220]   to try in your first month.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.360]   That's takethesus.com/huberman
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.060]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.100]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.520]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.400]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.240]   The company was founded
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.980]   by two all American swimmers from Stanford
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.500]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.540]   were designed with performance in mind
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.220]   and with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.960]   I spent my lifetime working on the visual system
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.140]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.260]   with a number of very important challenges
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.620]   in order to be able to see the world around you clearly.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.680]   Things like adjusting for background illumination
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.840]   so that when you go from a sunny area to a shady area,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.020]   you can see what's in front of you
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.700]   still with crystal clarity.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.460]   Roca takes all of that into account
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.860]   when designing their eyeglasses and sunglasses.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.060]   Their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.680]   also have some unique qualities.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.960]   For instance, because they were initially designed
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.700]   for performance with things like running and cycling,
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.740]   if you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.380]   Also, they're extremely lightweight.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.220]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.020]   I don't even remember that I'm wearing them.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.100]   I wear Roca eyeglasses at night, so I wear readers
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.900]   and I wear sunglasses often during the day
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.940]   if it's very bright or if I'm driving.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.060]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.620]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.140]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.620]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.340]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.060]   that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.900]   I've talked repeatedly about the fact
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.740]   that sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.380]   physical health, and performance.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.580]   So getting adequate deep sleep is absolutely essential.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.440]   Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.620]   is to make sure that the surface that you're sleeping on
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.060]   is the right one for you.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.340]   Helix understands this and they've created a sleep quiz.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.860]   That is, you go to their website and you fill out
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.660]   a brief quiz that asks questions like,
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.600]   do you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach?
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.140]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.120]   Maybe you don't know the answers,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.360]   in which case you simply say you don't know.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.280]   By taking that quiz, they will match you to a mattress
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.580]   that is ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.980]   I took that quiz and I matched
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.180]   to the so-called Dusk D-U-S-K mattress,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.220]   and I've been sleeping on that mattress for some time now,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.960]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.600]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.980]   to one that's uniquely tailored to your sleep needs,
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.380]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.620]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.380]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.240]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.640]   and two free pillows.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.820]   They have a 10-year warranty,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.100]   and you get to try out that mattress
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.720]   for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.540]   They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.040]   but I do believe that you will love it
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.460]   because you'll be sleeping far better than you have before.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.700]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.220]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.980]   to get up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.140]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Charles Zucker.
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.880]   Charles, thank you so much for joining me today.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.060]   - My pleasure.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.900]   - I want to ask you about many things
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.680]   related to taste and gustatory perception,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.340]   but maybe to start off,
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.540]   and because you've worked on a number of different topics
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.420]   in neuroscience, not just taste,
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.780]   how do you think about perception?
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.900]   Or rather, I should say,
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.260]   how should the world and people think about perception,
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260]   how it's different from sensation,
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.260]   and what leads to our experience of life
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.420]   in terms of vision, hearing, taste, et cetera?
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.420]   - So, you know, the brain is an extraordinary organ
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.540]   that weights maybe 2% of your body mass,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.260]   yet it consumes anywhere between 25 to 30%
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.780]   of all of your energy and oxygen.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.080]   And it gets transformed into a mind.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.400]   And this mind changes the human condition.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.180]   It changes, it transforms, you know, fear into courage,
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.520]   conformity into creativity,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.780]   sadness into happiness.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.280]   How the hell does that happen?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.760]   Now, the challenge that the brain faces
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.900]   is that the world is made of real things.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.940]   You know, this here is a glass,
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.100]   and this is a cord, and this is a microphone.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.820]   But the brain is only made of neurons
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.580]   that only understand electrical signals.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.140]   So how do you transform that reality
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.260]   into nothing that electrical signals
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.800]   that now need to represent the world?
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.040]   And that process is what we can
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.020]   operationally define as perception.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.360]   In the senses, let's say olfactory,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.320]   odor, taste, vision, you know,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.120]   we can very straightforwardly separate
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.380]   detection from perception.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.480]   Detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   you put it in your tongue,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.340]   and then a set of specific cells
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.140]   now sense that sugar molecule.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.920]   That's detection.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.940]   You haven't perceived anything yet.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.300]   That is just your cells in your tongue
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.840]   interacting with this chemical.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.680]   But now that cell gets activated
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.180]   and sends a signal to the brain,
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.180]   and now detection gets transformed into perception.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.060]   And it's trying to understand how that happens.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.060]   That's been the maniacal drive
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.600]   of my entire career in neuroscience.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.660]   How does the brain ultimately transform detection
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.280]   into perception so that it can guide actions and behaviors?
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.520]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   - Absolutely.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.340]   And is a very clear and beautiful description.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.460]   A sort of high-level question related to that.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.300]   And then I think we can get into some of the
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.680]   intermediate steps.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.980]   I think many people would like to know
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.340]   whether or not my perception of the color of your shirt
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.940]   is the same as your perception of the color of your shirt.
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.120]   - What an excellent question.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.840]   Am I okay to interrupt you as you're,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.520]   as I'm guessing what you're going?
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.360]   All right, very good.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.000]   - Interruption is welcome on this podcast.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.220]   The audience will always penalize me for interrupting you,
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.300]   and we'll never penalize you for interrupting me.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.020]   - I like the one way penalizing.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.340]   (laughing)
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.680]   Now, given what I told you before,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.500]   that the brain is trying to represent the world
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.820]   based in nothing but the transformation of these signals
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.660]   into electrical, you know, languages
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.740]   that now neurons have to encode and decode.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.980]   It follows that your brain is different than my brain.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.180]   And therefore it follows that the way
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.540]   that you're perceiving the world
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.180]   must be different than mine,
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.100]   even when receiving the same sensory cues, okay?
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.620]   And I'll tell you about an experiment.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.700]   It's a simple experiment, yet brilliant,
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.140]   that demonstrates why we perceive the world,
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.500]   how we perceive the world different.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.420]   So in the world of vision, as you know, well know,
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.320]   we have three classes of photoreceptor neurons
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   that sense three basic colors, red, blue, and green.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.680]   Blue, green, and red, if we go, you know,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.460]   from short to long wavelength.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.660]   And these three are sufficient to accommodate
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.300]   the full visible spectra.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.660]   I'm gonna take three light projectors,
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.480]   and I'm gonna project with one into a white screen,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.940]   red light, and the other one, green light.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.960]   I'm gonna overlap the two beams,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.860]   and on the screen, there'll be yellow.
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.800]   Okay, this is superposition
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.940]   when you have two beams of red and green.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.660]   And then I'm gonna take a third projector,
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.860]   and I'm gonna put a filter that projects
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   right next to that mixed beam, a spectrally pure yellow.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:16.220]   And I'm gonna ask you to come to the red and green projectors
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.540]   and play with intensity knobs so that you can match
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.260]   that yellow that you're projecting
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.180]   to the spectrally pure next to it.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.300]   Is this making sense?
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.140]   - Perfect sense.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.280]   - And I'm going to write down the numbers
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.680]   in those two volume intensity knobs.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.820]   And then I'm gonna ask the next person to do the same.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.060]   And then I'm gonna ask every person around this area
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.900]   of Battery Park in New York to do the same.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.020]   And guess what?
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.860]   We're gonna end up with thousands
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.180]   of different number combinations.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.300]   - Amazing.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.740]   - So for all of us, it's yellow enough
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.780]   that we can use a common language.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.820]   But for every one of us,
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.120]   that yellow is gonna be ever so slightly differently.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.440]   And so I think that simple psychological experiment
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.640]   beautifully illustrates how we truly perceive
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.960]   the world differently.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.060]   - I love that example.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.240]   And yet in that example, we know the basic elements
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.160]   from which color is created.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.200]   If we migrate into a slightly different sense,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.060]   let me pick a hard one, like--
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.000]   - Sound.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.700]   - Sound or olfaction.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.660]   - Yeah, very hard then to do an experiment
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.480]   that will allow us to get that degree of granularity
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.120]   and beautiful causality.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   Where we can show that A, produces and leads to B.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.220]   If I give you the smell of a rose,
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.720]   you can describe it to me.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.040]   If I smell the same rose, I can describe it also.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.880]   But I have no way whether the two of us
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.060]   are experiencing the same.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.060]   But it's close enough that we can both pretty much say
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.440]   that it has the following features or other determinants.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.760]   But no question that your experience is different than mine.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.360]   - The fact that it's good enough for us to both survive,
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.160]   that your perception of yellow and my perception of yellow,
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.000]   at least up until now,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.920]   is good enough for us both to survive.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.840]   - You got it.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.300]   - It raises a thought about a statement made
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.500]   by a colleague of ours, Marcus Meister at Caltech.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.800]   He's never been on this podcast,
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.500]   but in a review that I read by Marcus at one point,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.360]   he said that the basic function of perception
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.000]   is to divide our behavioral responses
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.420]   into the outcomes downstream
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.980]   of three basic emotional responses.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.420]   Yum, I like it.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.440]   Yuck, I hate it.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.380]   Or meh, whatever.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.360]   What do you think about,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.300]   I'm not looking to establish a debate
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.080]   between you and Marcus without Marcus here.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.920]   - I understand.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.180]   - But what I like about that is that it seems like the,
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.220]   we know the brain is a very economical organ in some sense,
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.640]   despite its high metabolic demands.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.700]   And this variation in perception
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.920]   from one individual to the next at once seems like a problem
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.800]   because we're all literally seeing different things.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.840]   And yet we function.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.680]   We function well enough for most of us to avoid death
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.560]   and cliffs and eating poisons and so forth,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.600]   and to enjoy some aspects of life, one hopes.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.040]   So is there a general statement that we can make
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.640]   about the brain, not just as a organ to generate perception,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.920]   not just as an organ to keep us alive,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.360]   but also an organ that is trying to batch our behaviors
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.000]   into general categories of-
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.720]   - I think so, but, and again,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.880]   I think the role of Marcus too.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.640]   And I think he's right that, you know,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.800]   broadly speaking, you could categorize a lot of behaviors
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.020]   falling into those two categories.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.240]   And that's 100% likely to be the case
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.020]   for animals in the wild.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   We're, you know, the choices are not necessarily binary,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.820]   but they're very unique and distinct.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.320]   Do I wanna eat this?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.080]   Do I wanna kill that?
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.000]   Do I wanna go there or do I wanna go here?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.880]   We humans deviated from that world long ago
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.320]   and, you know, learn to experience life
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.960]   where we do things that we should not be doing.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.320]   - Some of us more than others.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.280]   - Exactly.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.480]   You know, in my own world of taste,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.440]   the likelihood that an animal in the wild
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.300]   will enjoy eating something bitter,
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.340]   it's inconceivable.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.380]   Yet we, you know, love tonic water.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:29.500]   We enjoy, we like living on the edge.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.920]   We love enjoying experiences
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:38.840]   that makes us human.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.800]   And that goes beyond that simple set of categories,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.120]   which is yummy, yucky, ah, who cares?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.160]   And so I think it's not a bad palette,
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   but I think it's overly reductionist
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.340]   for certainly what we humans do.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.180]   - I agree.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.440]   And since we're here in New York,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.960]   I can say that the many options,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   the extensive variety of food, flora and fauna in New York
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.160]   explains a lot of the more nuanced behaviors
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.880]   that we observe.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   Let's talk about taste because while you've done
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.800]   extensive work in the field of vision,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.840]   and it's a topic that I love,
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.440]   you could spend all day on, taste is fascinating.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.000]   First of all, I'd like to know why you migrated
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.160]   from studying vision to studying taste.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.520]   And perhaps in that description,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.260]   you could highlight to us why we should think about
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.320]   and how we should think about the sense of taste.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.240]   - My goal has always been to understand,
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.080]   as I highlighted before, how the brain does its magic.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.660]   What part, you might wonder?
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.520]   Ideally, I like to help contribute to understand all of it.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:04.580]   How do you encode and decode emotions?
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.900]   How do you encode and decode memories and actions?
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.860]   How do you make decisions?
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.600]   How do you transform detection into perception?
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.100]   And the list goes on and on.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:23.100]   But one of the key things in science, as you know,
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.280]   is ensuring that you always ask the right question
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   so that you have a possibility of answering it.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.440]   Because if the question cannot be tractable
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   or reduced to an experimental path that helps you resolve it
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.580]   then we end up doing some really fun science
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.060]   but not necessarily answering the important problem
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.280]   that we want to study.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.700]   Make sense?
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.540]   All right.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.320]   - From a first person perspective, yes.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.220]   The hardest question, the most important question is,
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.080]   what question are you going to try and answer?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.820]   - And so, for example, I will have to understand
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.020]   the neural basis of empathy.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.840]   - It's a big market for that.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.140]   - 100%, but I wouldn't even know.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.780]   I mean, at the molecular level, that's what we do.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.560]   How do the circuits in your brain create that sense?
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.400]   I have no clue how to do it.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.180]   I can come up with ways to think about it,
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.500]   but I like to understand what in your brain
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.840]   makes someone a great philanthropist.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.760]   What is the neural basis of love?
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.320]   I wouldn't even know where to begin.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.680]   So if I want to begin to study these questions
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   about brain function that can cover so many aspects
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.060]   of the brain, I need to choose a problem
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.920]   that affords me that window.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.860]   But in a way that I can ask questions that give me answers.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:02.760]   And among the senses that have the capacity
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.200]   of transforming detection into perception
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.000]   of being stories, memories, of creating emotions,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.800]   of giving you different actions and perceptions
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.520]   as a function of the internal state.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.040]   When you're hungry, things taste very differently
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.680]   than when you're sated.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.240]   How, why?
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.080]   When you taste something, you now remember
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.040]   this amazing meal you had with your first date.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.280]   How does that happen?
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.120]   All right.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.720]   So if I want to begin to explore all of these things
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.880]   that the brain does, I felt I have to choose
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   a sensory system that affords some degree of simplicity
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:53.400]   in the way that the input output relationships
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.760]   are put together and in a way that still can be used
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.040]   to ask every one of these problems that the brain
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.060]   has to ultimately compute, encode, and decode.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.380]   And what was remarkable about the taste system
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.800]   at the time that I began working on this
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:17.260]   is that nothing was known about the molecular basis of taste.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.600]   We knew that we could taste what has been usually defined
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.840]   as the basic taste qualities.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.360]   Umami is a Japanese word that means yummy, delicious.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.800]   And that's in nearly every animal species,
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.160]   the taste of amino acids.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   And in humans, it's mostly associated with the taste of MSG,
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.800]   monosodium glutamate, one amino acid in particular.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.600]   - What are, just by way of example,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.560]   some foods that are rich in the umami-evoking stimulation?
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.120]   - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.440]   And it's a great, great flavor enhancer.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.160]   It enriches our sensory experience.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.880]   And so the beautiful thing of the system
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.040]   is that the lines of input are limited to five.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.160]   You know, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.560]   And each of them has a predetermined meaning.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.440]   You are born liking sugar and disliking bitter.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.520]   You have no choice.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.020]   These are hard-wired systems.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:39.160]   But of course, you can learn to dislike sugar
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.720]   and to like bitters, see?
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.660]   But in the wild, let's take humans out of the equation, eh?
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.520]   These are 100% predetermined.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.520]   You're born with that specific valence value
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.340]   for each taste of sweet, umami, and low salt
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.200]   are attractive taste qualities.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.820]   They evoke appetitive responses.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.940]   I wanna consume them.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:15.280]   And bitter and sour are innately predetermined
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   to be aversive.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.460]   - Could I interrupt you just briefly
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.600]   and ask a question about that exact point?
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.760]   For something to be appetitive to,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.180]   and some other taste to be aversive,
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.540]   and for those to be hard-wired,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.300]   can we assume that the sensation of very bitter,
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.860]   or of activation of bitter receptors in the mouth
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.300]   activates a neural circuit that causes closing of the mouth,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.480]   retraction of the tongue, and retraction of the body,
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.200]   and that the taste of something sweet
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.900]   might actually induce more licking?
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.260]   - 100%, you got it.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.820]   The activation of the receptors in the tongue
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.480]   that recognize sweet versus the ones that recognize bitter
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.280]   activate an entirely behavioral program.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:10.260]   And that program that we can refer as appetitiveness,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   or aversion, it's composed of many different subroutines.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:20.780]   In the case of bitter, it's very easy to actually look at,
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.960]   see them happening in animals,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.680]   because the first thing you do is you stop licking,
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   then you put a unhappy face, then you squint your eyes,
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.480]   and then you start gagging.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.020]   And that entire thing happens
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.880]   by the activation of a bitter molecule
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.100]   in a bitter sensing cell in your tongue.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.700]   - It's incredible.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.980]   - It's, again, the magic of the brain,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.980]   how it's able to encode and decode
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.340]   these extraordinary actions and behaviors
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.480]   in response of nothing but a simple,
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   very unique sensory stimuli.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.560]   Now, let me say that this palette of five basic tastes
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.980]   accommodates all the dietary needs of the organism.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.220]   Sweet to ensure that we get the right amount of energy.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.780]   Umami to ensure that we get proteins
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.460]   and that essential nutrient.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.740]   Salt, the three appetitive ones to ensure
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.980]   that we maintain our electrolyte balance.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:28.120]   Bitter to prevent the ingestion of toxic, nauseous chemicals.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.540]   Nearly all bitter tasting things out in the wild
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.280]   are bad for you.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.100]   And sour, most likely to prevent the ingestion
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.100]   of spoiled, acid, fermented foods.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.700]   And that's it.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.220]   That is the palette that we deal with.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.540]   Now, of course, there's a difference
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.640]   between basic taste and flavor.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.800]   Flavor is the whole experience.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.620]   Flavor is the combination of multiple tastes
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.180]   coming together, together with smell,
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:07.180]   with texture, with temperature, with the look of it
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.300]   that gives you what you and I would call
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.420]   the full sensory experience.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.660]   But we scientists need to reduce the problem
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.880]   into its basic elements so we can begin to break it apart
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.780]   before we put it back together.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.140]   So when we think about the sense of taste
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.200]   and we try to figure out how these lines of information
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.880]   go from your tongue to your brain
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.600]   and how they signal and how they get integrated
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.560]   and how they trigger all these different behaviors,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.480]   we look at them as individual qualities.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.960]   So we give the animal sweet or we give them a bitter,
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.260]   we give them sour.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   We avoid mixes because the first stage of discovery
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:56.120]   is to have that clarity as to what you're trying to extract
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.560]   so that you can hopefully, meaningfully make a difference
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.860]   by being able to figure out how is it
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.080]   that A goes to B to C and to D.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.920]   Does this make sense?
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.600]   - Yeah, almost like the primary colors
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.360]   to create the full array of the color spectrum.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.780]   - Exactly.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.380]   - Before I ask you about the first and second
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.660]   and third stages of taste and flavor perception,
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.720]   is there any idea that there may be more than five?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.100]   - There is, for example, what about fat?
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.160]   - I love the taste.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.000]   - I love fat too.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.520]   - And I love the texture of fat,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.740]   especially if it's slightly burnt.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.240]   Like in South America, when I visited Buenos Aires,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.760]   I found that at the end of a meal, they would take a steak,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.680]   the trimming off the edge of the steak, burn it slightly,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.080]   and then serve it back to me.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.320]   And I thought, that's disgusting.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.080]   And then I tasted it and it's delightful.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.920]   - It is.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.880]   - There's nothing quite like it.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.680]   - This goes back to this notion before
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.380]   that we like to live on the edge.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.840]   And we like to do things that we should not be doing
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.680]   with Andrew.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.840]   But on the other hand, look at those muscles.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.500]   [both laughing]
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.800]   - I don't suggest anyone eat pure fat.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.440]   The listeners of this podcast will immediately,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.240]   I'm sure there'll be a YouTube video soon
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.600]   that I like eating pure fat.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.920]   I'm not in on a ketogenic diet, et cetera,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.540]   but fat is tasty.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.380]   - It is.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.760]   - As evidenced by the obesity problem
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.600]   that exists in this country.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.400]   - We'll talk about that in a little bit
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.800]   about the gut brain axis.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.040]   I think it'll be important to cover it
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.620]   because it's the other side of the taste system.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:38.600]   And so, so missing tastes, you know, one is fat.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.440]   Although like you clearly highlighted,
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.520]   a lot of fat taste, in quotation marks,
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   is really the feeling of fat rolling on your tongue.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.760]   And so there is a compelling argument
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.720]   that a lot of what we call fat taste,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.580]   it's really mechanosensory.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:09.480]   It's somatosensory cells, cells that are not responding
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.260]   to taste, but they're responding to mechanical stimulation
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.020]   of fat molecules rolling on the tongue
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.380]   that gives you that perception of fat.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.060]   - I love the idea that there is a perception of fat
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.180]   regardless of whether or not there's a dedicated receptor
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.660]   for fat, mostly because it's evoking sensations
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.420]   and imagery of the taste of slightly burnt fat.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.900]   - For example, and another one, you know,
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.220]   you could argue is metallic taste.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.000]   You know, I know exactly what it tastes like.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.060]   You know, if you ask me to explain it,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.580]   I will have a hard time.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.420]   You know, what are the palettes of that color
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.980]   that can allow me to define it?
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.860]   I wouldn't be easy, but I know precisely
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.700]   what it tastes like.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.660]   You know, take a penny, put it in your mouth
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.380]   and you know what it tastes like, yeah?
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.380]   - Or blood. - Or blood.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.160]   That's another very good example.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.100]   And is there really, you know, a receptor for metallic taste
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.220]   or it's nothing but this magical combination
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.700]   of the activation of the existing lines.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.340]   Think of it as lines of information,
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.600]   just separate lines by the keys of a piano, yeah?
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.300]   Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, you play the key
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.580]   and you activate that one chord.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.860]   And that one chord in the case of a piano leads to a note,
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.860]   you know, a tune, and in the case of taste
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.680]   leads to an action and a behavior.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.880]   But you play many of them together and something emerges
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.840]   that it's different than any one of the pieces.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.280]   And it's possible that metallic, for example,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.960]   represents the combination of the activity
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   just in the right ratio of these added lines.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.740]   - Makes sense.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.160]   And it actually provides a perfect,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.600]   your example of the piano provides a perfect segue
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.320]   for what I'd like to touch on next,
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   which is if you would describe the sequence of neural events
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.240]   leading to a perceptual event of taste.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.560]   And I'm certain that somewhere in there
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.100]   you will embed an answer to the question
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.600]   of whether or not we indeed have different taste receptors
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.160]   distributed in different locations on our tongue
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.520]   or elsewhere in the mouth.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.520]   - Yes, so let's start by debunking that old tale and myth.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.280]   - Who came up with that?
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.840]   - There are many views, but the most prevalent
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.920]   is that there was an original drawing
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   describing the sensitivity of the tongue to different tastes.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.480]   So imagine I can take a Q-tip.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.760]   This is a thought experiment, yeah?
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.400]   And I'm gonna dip that Q-tip in salt and in quinine
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.740]   as something bitter and glucose as something sweet.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.100]   And I'm gonna take that Q-tip, ask you to stick your tongue
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.320]   out and start moving it around your tongue
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.480]   and ask you, what do you feel?
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   And then I'm going to change the concentration
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.600]   of the amount of salt or the amount of bitter
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.320]   and ask, can I get some sort of a map of sensitivity
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.660]   to the different tastes?
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:35.000]   And the argument that has emerged is that
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.060]   there is a good likelihood that the data
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.700]   was simply mistranslated as it was being drawn.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.600]   And of course that led to an entire industry.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.540]   This is the way you maximize your wine experience
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.320]   because now we're going to form the vessel
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.920]   that you're gonna drink from so that it acts maximally
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.920]   on the receptors which happen all right.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:07.220]   Now, there is no tongue map, all right?
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.320]   We have taste buds distributed in various parts of the tongue
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   so there is a map on the distribution of taste buds.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.300]   But each taste bud has around 100 taste receptor cells.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.780]   And those taste receptor cells can be of five types,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:31.040]   sweet, sour, bitter, salty or umami.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   And for the most part, all taste buds
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.140]   have the representation of all five taste qualities.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.640]   Now, there's no question that there is a slight bias
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.800]   for some tastes.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.320]   Like, bitter is particularly enriched
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.100]   at the very back of your tongue.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.320]   And there is a teleological basis for that,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.040]   actually a biological basis for that.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.840]   That's the last line of defense
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.000]   before you swallow something bad.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And so, let's make sure that the very back of your tongue
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.520]   has plenty of these bad news receptors
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.320]   so that if they get activated,
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.960]   you can trigger a gagging reflex
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.920]   and get rid of this that otherwise may kill you, okay?
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.800]   - That's good sense.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.720]   - But the notion that all sweet is in the front
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   and salt is on the side, it's not real.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   Not real.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.880]   And there, go ahead.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.640]   - Oh, I was just gonna ask, are there,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.880]   first of all, thank you for dispelling that myth.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.720]   - Yes.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.360]   - And we will propagate that information
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.240]   as far and wide as we can
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.600]   'cause I think that's the number one myth related to taste.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.640]   The other one is,
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.760]   are there taste receptors anywhere else in the mouth?
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.400]   For instance, on the lips. - Yeah, the palate.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.640]   The palate, not the lips.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.360]   So, it's in the far range at the very back
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.600]   of the oral cavity, the tongue and the palate.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.320]   And the palate is very rich in sweet receptors.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.480]   - I'll have to pay attention to this
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.200]   the next time I eat something sweet.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.520]   - Whether you pull it up, yeah?
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   Now, the important thing is that
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:17.840]   after the receptors for these five, the detectors,
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.200]   the molecules that sends sweet, sour, beet, and salt to mommy,
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.280]   these are receptors, proteins,
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.840]   found on the surface of taste receptor cells
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.280]   that interact with these chemicals.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.440]   And once they interact,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.480]   then they trigger the cascade of events,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.740]   biochemical events inside the cell
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.880]   that now sends an electrical signal
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   that says there is sweet here or there is salt here.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.560]   Now, having these receptors
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.160]   and my laboratory identify the receptors
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.600]   for all five basic taste classes,
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.840]   sweet, beet, salt, to mommy, and most recently sour,
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.520]   now completing the palate,
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.240]   you can now use these receptors
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.480]   to really map where are they found in the tongue
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.660]   in a very rigorous way.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.160]   This is no longer about using a Q-tip
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.240]   and trying to figure out what you're feeling,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.080]   but rather what you have in your tongue.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.720]   This is not a guess.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.600]   This is now a physical map
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.480]   that says the sweet receptors are found here.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.840]   The bitter are found here.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.940]   And when you do that, you find that in fact,
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.680]   every taste pad throughout your oral cavity
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.220]   has receptors for all of the basic taste classes.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.440]   - Amazing.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.120]   And as it turns out,
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.680]   and I'm sure you'll tell us important
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.120]   in terms of thinking about how the brain computes
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.180]   and codes and decodes this thing we call taste.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.960]   I'm going to inject a quick question
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.040]   that I'm sure is on many people's minds
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.840]   before we get back into the biological circuit,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.960]   which is many people, including myself,
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.160]   are familiar with the experience
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.320]   of drinking a sip of tea or coffee that is too hot
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.380]   and burning my tongue is the way I would describe it.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.220]   Horrible.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.120]   And then disrupting my sense of taste
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.880]   for some period of time afterward.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.780]   - Yes.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.040]   - When I experienced that phenomenon,
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.560]   that unfortunate phenomenon,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.080]   have I destroyed taste receptors that regenerate
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.640]   or have I somehow used temperature
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.560]   to distort the function of the circuit
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.120]   so that I no longer taste the way I did before?
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.200]   - Excellent question.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.120]   And the answer is both.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.680]   It turns out that your taste receptors
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.140]   only leave for around two weeks.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.380]   And this, by the way, makes sense
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.220]   because here you have an organ, the tongue,
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:46.040]   that is continuously exposed
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.200]   to everything you could range from the nicest
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.160]   to the most horrible possible thing.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.400]   - Use your imagination.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.760]   (laughing)
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.600]   - And so you need to make sure
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   that these cells are always coming back in a way
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.080]   that I can re-experience the world in the right way.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.920]   And there are other organs
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.960]   that have the same underlying logic, okay?
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.360]   Your gut, your intestines are the same way.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.620]   Yeah, amazing.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.560]   Again, they're receiving everything that you ingest,
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.520]   God forbid what's there,
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.080]   from the spiciest to the most horrible tasting,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.820]   so the most delicious.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.700]   And again, those intestinal cells whose role is
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.880]   to ultimately take all these nutrients
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.940]   and bring them into the body,
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.940]   also renewal in a very, very fast cycle.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:46.220]   Olfactory neurons in your nose is the other example.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.640]   So then A, yes, you're burning a lot of your cells
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.680]   and it's over for those.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.480]   The good news is that they're gonna come back.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.660]   But we know that when you burn yourself with tea,
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:04.660]   they come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.560]   And these cells are not renewing in that timeframe.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.520]   They're not listening to your needs.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.660]   They have their own internal clock.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   And so you are really affecting,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.540]   you're damaging them in a way that they can recover.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.780]   And then they come back
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.380]   and you also damage your somatosensory cells.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.300]   These are the cells that feel things, not taste things.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.840]   And then, you know, you wait half an hour or so,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.480]   and then, my goodness, thank God, it's back to normal.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.500]   - And most of the time, I don't even notice the transition,
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.140]   realizing, as you tell me.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.640]   And later, I'll ask you about the relationship
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.720]   between odor and taste.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.880]   But as a next step along the circuit,
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.700]   let's assume I ingest some,
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.240]   let's keep it simple, a sweet taste.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.600]   - Let's make it even simpler,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.440]   but at the same time, perhaps more informative.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.080]   - Let's compare and contrast sweet and bitter
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.100]   as we follow their lines from the tongue to the brain.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.560]   So the first thing is that the two evoke
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.120]   diametrically opposed behaviors.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.320]   If we have to come up with two sensory experiences
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   that represent polar opposites, it will be sweet and bitter.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.720]   There are not two colors that represent polar opposites
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.680]   because, you know, you could say black and white,
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.760]   they are polar opposites.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.920]   One detects only one thing,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.560]   the other one detects everything.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.900]   But they don't evoke different behaviors.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.440]   - Even the political parties have some over them.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.000]   - Sweet and bitter are the two opposite ends
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.400]   of the sensory spectra.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:58.580]   Now, a taste can be defined by two features.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:04.200]   Again, I'm a reductionist, so I'm reducing it in a way
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.700]   that I think is easier to follow the signal.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.260]   And the two features are its quality
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.020]   and its valence.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.160]   And valence with a little V,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.680]   that's what we say in Spanish with a V,
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   means the value of that experience, all right?
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.080]   Or in this case of that stimuli.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:35.080]   And you take sweet, sweet has a quality,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.640]   an identity, and that's what you and I will refer to
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.480]   as the taste of sweet.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   We know exactly what it tastes like.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.580]   But sweet also has a positive valence,
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:53.280]   which makes it incredibly attractive and appetitive.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.380]   But it's attractive and appetitive,
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.720]   as I'll tell you in a second,
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.760]   independent of its identity and quality.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.280]   In fact, we have been able to engineer animals
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.140]   where we completely remove the valence from the stimuli.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.800]   So these animals can taste sweet,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   can recognize it as sweet, but it's no longer attractive.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.520]   It's just one more chemical stimuli.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.360]   And that's because the identity and the valence
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.180]   are encoded in two separate parts of the brain.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:33.460]   In the case of bitter, again, it has, on the one hand,
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.480]   its identity, its quality.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.840]   And you know exactly what bitter tastes like.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.420]   - I can taste it now, even as you describe it.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.200]   - But it also has a valence, and that's a negative valence,
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.740]   because it evokes aversive behaviors.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.880]   Are we on?
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.760]   - Absolutely. - All right.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.080]   - And it comes to mind, I remember telling some kids recently
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.920]   that we're gonna go get ice cream, and it was interesting.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.740]   They looked up and they started smacking their lip,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.560]   like, you know, they'll actually evoke-
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.860]   - The anticipatory response, absolutely.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.300]   When we talk about the gut brain, maybe we'll get there.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.840]   So then the signals, if we follow now these two lines,
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.100]   they're really like two separate keys
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.340]   at the two ends of this keyboard.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:21.180]   And you press one key and you activate this cord.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.100]   So you activate the sweet cells throughout your oral cavity,
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.260]   and they all converge into a group of sweet neurons.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:34.260]   In the next station, which is still outside the brain,
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.080]   is one of the taste ganglia.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.960]   These are the neurons that innervate your tongue
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.560]   and the oral cavity.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.040]   - Where do they sit approximately?
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.440]   - Around there. - Yeah, right here
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.240]   around the lymph nodes, more or less.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.060]   - You got it.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:54.100]   And there are two main ganglia that innervate
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.100]   the vast majority of all taste buds in the oral cavity.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.540]   And then from there, that sweet signal
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.760]   goes onto the brainstem.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.880]   The brainstem is the entry of the body into the brain.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.920]   And there are different areas of the brainstem,
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.760]   and there are different groups of neurons in the brainstem,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.640]   and there's this unique area,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   in a unique topographically defined location
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:29.340]   in the rostral side of the brainstem
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.680]   that receives all of the taste input.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.520]   - A very dense area of the brain.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.000]   A very rich area of the brain, exactly.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.760]   And from there, the sweet signal goes to this other area,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.560]   higher up on the brainstem.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:51.000]   And then it goes through a number of stations
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.040]   where that sweet signal goes from sweet neuron
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.800]   to sweet neuron to sweet neuron
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.280]   to eventually get to your cortex.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.140]   And once it gets to your taste cortex,
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:08.140]   that's where meaning is imposed into that signal.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.560]   It's then, and only then, this is what the data suggests,
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:20.500]   that now you can identify this as a sweet stimuli.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.680]   - And how quickly does that all happen?
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.280]   - You know, the timescale of the nervous system,
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   it's fast, yeah?
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.040]   And so-- - Within less than a second.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.600]   - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.440]   - I rarely mistake bitter for sweet.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   Maybe with respect to people and my own poor judgment,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.960]   but not with respect to taste.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.700]   - Yeah, and in fact, we can demonstrate this
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.800]   because we can stick electrodes
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.340]   at each of these stations conceptually, yeah?
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.940]   And we can stimulate the tongue
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:53.920]   and then we can record the signals,
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.360]   pretty much time log to stimulus delivery.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   You deliver the stimuli and within a fraction of a second,
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:05.680]   you see now the response in these following stations.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.060]   Now it gets to the cortex, yeah?
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:12.600]   And now in there, you impose meaning to that taste.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.900]   There's an area of your brain
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.900]   that represents the taste of sweet in taste cortex
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:25.460]   and a different area that represents the taste of bitter.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.080]   In essence, there is a topographic map
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.340]   of these taste qualities inside your brain.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:36.240]   Now we're gonna do a thought experiment, all right?
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.620]   Now, if this group of neurons in your cortex
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.920]   really represents the sense of sweet
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.020]   and this added different group of neurons in your brain
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:51.020]   represents the taste, the perception of bitter,
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:55.780]   then we should be able to do two things.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.760]   First, I should be able to go into your brain,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.020]   somehow silence those neurons,
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.500]   find a way to prevent them from being activated
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.900]   and I can give you all the sweet you want
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.380]   and you'll never know that you're tasting sweet.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:18.300]   And conversely, I should be able to go into your brain,
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.740]   come up with a way to activate those neurons
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.140]   while I'm giving you absolutely nothing
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.080]   and you're gonna think
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.860]   that you're getting that full percept.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:34.060]   And that's precisely what we have done
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.740]   and that's precisely what you get.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.220]   This of course is in the brain of mice.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.540]   - But presumably in humans, it would work similar.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.180]   - Absolutely the same, zeroed out.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.900]   I have no questions.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:50.080]   So this attests to two important things.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.980]   The first to the predetermined nature of the sense of taste
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.980]   because it means I can go to these parts of your brain
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.200]   in the absence of any stimuli
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:06.120]   and have you throw the full behavioral experience.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.420]   In fact, when we activate in your cortex,
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.740]   these bitter neurons, the animal can start gagging
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.580]   but it's drinking only water
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:23.380]   but the animal thinks that it's getting a bit of stimuli.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.140]   - This is amazing.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.560]   And so, and the second, just to finish the line
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.200]   so that it doesn't sound like it teaches two things
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.960]   and then I only give you one lesson,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:40.760]   is that it substantiates this capacity of the brain
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.800]   to segregate, to separate in these nodes of action,
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.240]   the representation of these two diametrically opposed
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.900]   percepts, which is sweet, for example, versus bitter.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.400]   The reason I say amazing and that is also amazing
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.440]   is the following.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.740]   You told us earlier and you're absolutely correct,
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.880]   of course, that the end of the day,
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.800]   whether or not it's one group of neurons over here
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.340]   and another group of neurons over there,
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.900]   just the way it turns out to be,
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:16.520]   electrical activity is the generic common language
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.640]   of both sets of neurons.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.320]   So that raises the question for me
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.160]   of whether or not those separate sets of neurons
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.920]   are connected to areas of the brain
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.200]   that create this sense of valence
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.840]   or whether or not they're simply created, connected,
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.440]   excuse me, to sets of neurons that evoke distinct behaviors
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.760]   of moving towards and inhaling more and licking or aversive.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.400]   Are we essentially interpreting our behavior
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.080]   and our micro responses or are micro responses
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.320]   and our behaviors the consequence of the percept?
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.540]   - Excellent, excellent question.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:53.540]   So first the answer is they go into an area of the brain
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   where valence is imposed and that area is known
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:06.260]   as the amygdala and the sweet neurons go to a different area
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.660]   than the bitter neurons.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.500]   Now, I wanna do a thought experiment
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.760]   because I think your audience might appreciate this.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.600]   Let's say I activate this group of neurons
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   and the animal increases licking
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.060]   and I'm activating the sweet neurons
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.940]   and so that's expected because now it's, you know,
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.700]   tasting this water as if it was sugar.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.120]   Now, this is Moses transforming water into wine.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.300]   In this case, we're gonna, and today is Passover
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.500]   so then it's an appropriate, you know, example.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:42.420]   We're transforming it into sweet, yeah?
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:47.520]   But how do I know, how do I know that activating them
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.160]   is evoking a positive feeling inside, a goodness,
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   a satisfaction, I love it versus I'm just increasing licking
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.200]   which is the other option because all we're seeing
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.800]   is that the animal is licking more
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.680]   and we're trying to infer that that means
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.960]   that he's feeling something really good versus you know what?
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.720]   That piano line is going back straight into the tongue
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.900]   and all he's doing is forcing it to move faster.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.640]   Well, we can actually separate this by doing experiments
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.100]   that allow us to fundamentally distinguish them.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:26.080]   And imagine the following experiment.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.260]   I'm gonna take the animal and I'm gonna put them
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.520]   inside a box that has two sides
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.520]   and the two sides have features that make them different.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.520]   One has yellow little toys, the other one has green toys.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.720]   One has little, you know, black stripes,
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.320]   the other one has blue stripes.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.400]   So the animal can tell the two halves.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.200]   I take the mouse, put them inside this arena,
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.880]   this play arena and it will explore
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.860]   and poach around both sides with equal frequency.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:02.040]   And now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna activate
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.000]   these neurons, these sweet neurons,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.640]   every time the animal is on the side with the yellow stripes
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.160]   and if that is creating a positive internal state,
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.040]   what would the animal now want to do?
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:29.040]   It will want to stay on the side with the yellow stripes.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.180]   There's no leaking here.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.320]   The animal is not extending its tongue
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   every time I'm activating these neurons, okay?
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.320]   This is known as a place preference test
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.960]   and it's generally used, it's just one form
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.520]   of many different tests to demonstrate
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:53.680]   that the activation of a group of neurons in the brain
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.320]   is imposing, for example,
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.780]   a positive versus a negative valence.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.560]   Whereas if they do the same thing
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.440]   by activating the bitter neurons,
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.920]   the animal will actively want now to stay away from the side
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.360]   where these neurons are being activated
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.840]   and that's precisely what you see.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.400]   - And that's precisely what we see.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.440]   - Many people including myself are familiar
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.500]   with the experience of going to a restaurant,
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.040]   eating a variety of foods
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.240]   and then fortunately it doesn't happen that often
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.600]   but then feeling very sick.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.540]   I learned coming up in neuroscience
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:34.540]   that this is one strong example of one trial learning
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.560]   that from that point on, it's not the restaurant
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.480]   or the waitress or the waiter or the date
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.240]   but it's my notion of it had to have been the shrimp
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.280]   that leads me to then want to avoid shrimp in every context,
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.080]   maybe even shrimp powder.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.000]   - You got it.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.400]   - For a very long time.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.600]   I can imagine all the evolutionarily adaptive reasons
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.440]   why this such a phenomenon would exist.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.720]   Do we have any concept of where in this pathway that exists?
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   - We know actually a significant amount at a general level.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.840]   In fact, more than shrimp,
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.800]   oysters are even a more dramatic example.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.400]   One bad oyster is all you need
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.160]   to be driven away for the next six months.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.040]   - I think because of the texture alone
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.720]   is something that one learns to overcome.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.640]   I actually really enjoy oysters.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.480]   I despise mussels, despise shrimp,
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.480]   not the animal but the taste
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.240]   and yet oysters, for some reason,
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.880]   I've yet to have a bad experience.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.400]   - It's like uni by the way, texture is hard to get over
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.200]   but once you get over, it's delicious.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.760]   - That's what they tell me.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.480]   We were both in San Diego at one point
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.720]   and I'll give a plug to Sushi Ota
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.280]   is kind of the famous little-- - Oh my goodness.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.240]   - And they have amazing uni and I've tried it twice
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.560]   and I'm oh for two.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.120]   Somehow the texture outweighs any kind of the deliciousness
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:57:59.960]   that people report.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.440]   - It's a very acquired taste, it's like beer.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.760]   - I grew up in Chile.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.560]   That's where the accent comes from in case anyone wonder.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.280]   And by the time I came here to graduate school,
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   I was 19, too old to overcome my heavy Chilean accent.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:24.040]   So here I am 40 years, 50 years late, not quite, 40 plus.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:24.880]   - We appreciate it.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.080]   - And I still sound like I just came off the boat.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.640]   So in Chile, you don't drink beer when you're young.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.560]   You drink wine, Chile is a huge wine producer.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:40.800]   So when I came to the US, all of my classmates
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.040]   were drinking beer because they had finished college
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.520]   where they were all beer drinking and graduate school,
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.840]   you're working 18 hours a day every day.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.960]   The way they relax, let's go and have some beers.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.000]   - And beer is cheaper.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.880]   - And beer is cheap.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.440]   And we were being clearly underpaid, may I add.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.640]   I couldn't do it.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.520]   It's an acquired taste.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.560]   It was too late by then.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.600]   And here I am, you know, 60 plus.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.120]   And if you take all the beer I've drunk in my entire life,
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.000]   I would say they add to less than an eight ounce
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.400]   in glass of water.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.240]   - Impressive.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.000]   Well, your health is probably better for it.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:24.840]   - I'm not sure.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.760]   - Your physical health anyway.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.640]   - It goes back to, you know, acquired taste.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.240]   This is the connection to uni and to oysters.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.320]   Now going back to the one trial learning.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.840]   You know, this is the great thing about our brains.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.240]   Certain things we need to repeat a hundred times
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.520]   to learn them.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.160]   Hello operator, can I have the phone number
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.160]   for sushi ota please?
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.440]   And then she'll give it to you over the phone,
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.240]   at least in the old days.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.120]   And then you need to repeat it to yourself
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.960]   over and over and over over the next minute
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.040]   so you can dial sushi ota.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:03.080]   And five minutes later, it's gone.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.320]   That's what we call working memory.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.480]   Then there is the short-term memory.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.160]   We park our car and if we're lucky by the end of the day,
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.080]   we remember where it is.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.680]   And then there is the long-term memory.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.920]   We remember the birthdays of every one of our children
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.560]   for the rest of our lives.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.200]   Well, there are events that a single event is so traumatic
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.520]   that it activates the circuits in a way
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.960]   that it's a one trial learning.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.440]   And the taste system is literally
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.280]   at the top of that food chain.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.360]   And there is a phenomenon known as condition taste aversion.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.440]   You can pair an attractive stimuli with a really bad one.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.360]   And you can make an animal begin to vehemently
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.440]   dislike, for example, sugar.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.960]   And that's because you've conditioned the animals
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.960]   to now be averse to this otherwise nice taste
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.640]   because it's been associated with malaise.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.920]   And when you do that, now you could begin to ask,
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   why does change in the signal as it travels from the tongue
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.680]   to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.120]   where you have now transformed sweet
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.840]   from being attractive to being aversive?
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.520]   And this is the way now you begin to explore
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.440]   how the brain changes the nature, the quality,
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   the meaning of a stimuli as a function of its state.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.240]   - I have a number of questions related to that,
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.120]   all of which relate to this idea of context.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.380]   Because you mentioned before that flavor
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.760]   is distinct from taste because flavor involves smell,
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.860]   texture, temperature, and some other features.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:02.380]   Ooni, sea urchin being a good example of,
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.300]   I can sense the texture.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.400]   It actually, yeah, I won't describe
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.360]   what it reminds me of for various reasons.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.440]   The ability to place context on into,
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.520]   to insert context into a perception
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.520]   or rather to insert a perception into context is so powerful.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:27.240]   And there's an element of kind of mystery about it,
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.760]   but if we start to think about some of the more nuance
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.100]   that we like to live at the edge, as you say,
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:39.320]   how many different tastes on the taste dial,
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.640]   to go back to your analogy earlier, the color dial,
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.800]   do you think that there could be
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.920]   for something as fixed as bitter?
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.420]   So for instance, I don't think I like bitter taste,
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.680]   but I like some fermented foods
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.360]   that seem to have a little bit of sour
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.660]   and have a little bit of that briny flavor.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.580]   How much plasticity do you think there is there,
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.000]   and in particular across the lifespan?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.280]   Because I think one of the most salient examples of this
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.520]   is that kids don't seem to like certain vegetables,
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.200]   but they all are hardwired to like sweet tastes.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.760]   And yet you could also imagine that one of the reasons
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.620]   why they may eventually grow to incorporate vegetables
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.840]   is because of some knowledge
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.580]   that vegetables might be better for them.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.720]   So is there a change in the receptors,
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.140]   the distribution, the number, the sensitivity, et cetera,
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.200]   that can explain the transition
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.160]   from wanting to avoid vegetables
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   to being willing to eat vegetables
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.480]   simply in childhood to early development?
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.600]   - I'm going to take the question slightly differently,
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.840]   but I think it would illustrate the point.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.840]   And I'm gonna just use the difference
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.700]   between the olfactory system and the taste system
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.760]   to make the point.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.700]   Taste system, five basic palates.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.360]   Sweet sour, bitter salt, and umami.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.680]   Each of them has a predetermined identity.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.480]   We know exactly what, and valence.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.440]   These are attractive, these are aversive.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.800]   In the olfactory system,
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.040]   it's claimed that we can smell millions of different others.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.040]   Yet, for the most part,
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   none of them have an innate predetermined meaning.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.920]   In the olfactory system,
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.080]   meaning is imposed by learning and experience,
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.440]   even the smell of smoke.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.600]   So I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna make it differently.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.360]   There are a handful of the millions of others
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.440]   that were claimed that you could immediately tell me
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.680]   these are aversive and these are attractive.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.800]   - Vomit.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.580]   - So vomit, it's not correct because I can assure you
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.440]   that there are cultures and societies
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.160]   where things which are far less appealing than vomit
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.080]   do not evoke an aversive reaction.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.360]   - Really? - Really.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.080]   Sulfur would be maybe a universal.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.640]   I'm not talking pheromones, okay?
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.400]   Pheromones are in a different category
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.640]   that trigger innate responses.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   But nearly every other is afforded meaning
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.200]   by learning and experience.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.460]   And that's why you like broccoli and I despise broccoli
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:22.960]   because I remember my mother forcing me to eat broccoli.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.700]   Same sensory experience, all right.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:30.880]   This accommodates two important things.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.000]   In the case of taste,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.140]   you have neurons at every station that are for sweet,
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.600]   for sour, for bitter, for salty and umami.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.880]   It's only five classes.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.080]   So it's not gonna take a lot of your brain.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.080]   If we can in fact smell a million others
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.280]   and every one of us have others
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.500]   had to have predetermined meaning,
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.120]   there's not gonna be enough brain
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.600]   just to accommodate that one sense.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.300]   And so evolution in its infinite wisdom,
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:03.340]   evolve a system where you put together a pathway
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.800]   and a cortex, olfactory cortex,
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:11.440]   where you have the capacity to associate every other
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:17.340]   in a specific context that now gives it the meaning.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:23.800]   Now, let's go back to the original question then.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.160]   So other than clearly plastic, mega plastic,
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.160]   because it's fundamental basis and neural organization.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:34.940]   But taste, we just told you
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.340]   that's predetermined hardwired.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.180]   But predetermined hardwired doesn't mean
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.340]   that it's not modulated by learning or experience.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:47.580]   It only means that you are born liking sweet
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.220]   and disliking bitter.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.820]   And we have many examples of plasticity,
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.220]   beer being one example.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.340]   So why do we learn to love beer?
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.980]   It's in coffee.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:04.980]   It's because it has an associated gain to the system.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.600]   And that gain to the system,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.320]   that positive valence that emerges
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.720]   out of that negative signal is sufficient
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:19.200]   to create that positive association.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.840]   And in the case of beer, of course, is alcohol.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.200]   The feeling good that we get after
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.400]   is more than sufficient to say,
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.900]   I wanna have more of this.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.280]   And in the case of coffee, of course,
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.180]   is caffeine activating a whole group
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.940]   of neurotransmitter systems that give you
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.340]   that high associated with coffee.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.920]   So yes, this taste system is changeable,
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.100]   it's malleable, and it's subjected
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.220]   to learning and experience.
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.940]   But unlike the olfactory system,
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.160]   it's restricted in what you could do with it,
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.100]   because its goal is to allow you
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.540]   to get nutrients and survive.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.600]   The goal of the olfactory system is very different.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.740]   It's being used, not in our case,
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.760]   but in every animal species,
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.720]   to identify friend versus foe,
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.540]   to identify mate,
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:18.840]   to identify ecological niches they wanna be in.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.960]   So it plays a very broad role
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.800]   that then requires that it be set up,
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.840]   organized, and function
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.540]   in a very different type of context.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.260]   Taste is about, can we get the nutrients
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.140]   we need to survive?
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.900]   And can we ensure that we are attracted
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.500]   to the ones we need, and we're averse
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.400]   to the ones that are going to kill us?
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.420]   I'm being overly simplistic and reductionist,
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.260]   but I think it illustrates a huge difference
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.580]   between these two chemosensory systems.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.960]   - I don't think you're being overly simplistic.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.760]   I think it illustrates the key intractable nature
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.600]   of this system and the way you've approached it,
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.860]   and I think it's important for people to hear that,
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.020]   because everybody, as we are,
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:07.400]   is mystified with empathy and love, et cetera.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.280]   So in fairness to that,
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.920]   I'm gonna ask a sort of a high-level question
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.160]   or abstract question.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.880]   This was based on a conversation I had
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.500]   with a former girlfriend,
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.820]   where we were talking about chemistry
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.240]   between individuals.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.180]   Very complicated topic on the one hand,
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:29.260]   but on the other hand, quite simple
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.200]   in that certain people, for whatever reason,
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.980]   evoke a tremendous sense of arousal,
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.820]   for lack of a better word, between two people,
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.660]   one would hope.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.660]   At least for some period of time.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.940]   - I didn't know this was that kind of a podcast.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.260]   - No, well, the reason I,
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.660]   but this has to do with taste,
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.880]   because she said something,
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.600]   I think in part to maybe irritate me a bit,
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.480]   but we were commenting not about our own experience
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.640]   of each other,
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.200]   but of someone that she was now very excited about.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.340]   We're on good terms.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:08.780]   And she said, "What do you think it is,
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:10.120]   this thing of chemistry?"
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.160]   So maybe she was trying to, you know.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.800]   - Warn you of what's coming.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.120]   - Warn me of what's coming.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.760]   And she said, "I have a feeling something about it
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   is in smell and something about it is actually in taste."
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.540]   Literally the taste of somebody's breath.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.440]   That's the way she described it.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.000]   And I thought that it was a very interesting example
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.640]   for a number of reasons,
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.580]   but in particular,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:37.340]   because it gets to the merging of odor and taste,
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.800]   but also to the idea that,
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.320]   of course, the context of a new relationship,
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.820]   I'm assuming, and in fact,
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.500]   they're both attractive people, et cetera.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.680]   There's a whole context there,
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   but I've had the experience of the odor of somebody's breath
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.800]   being aversive,
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.260]   not because I could identify it as aversive.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.100]   - Because you just didn't like it.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.160]   - But because it just didn't like it.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.160]   - But that's because you associate it with other others
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:13.460]   that trigger that negative aversive reaction, by the way.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.920]   - Absolutely.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.000]   There are certain perfumes to me that are aversive.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:19.840]   - You got it.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.360]   - There are other scents, I can recall,
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.060]   scents of skin, of foods, et cetera,
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.240]   that are immensely repetitive.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.420]   So I've experienced both sides of this equation myself,
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.840]   and she was describing this,
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.680]   and to me, more than tasting wine,
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.160]   which is the typical example,
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.300]   where people inhale it and then they drink it,
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.760]   to me, this seems like something
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.160]   that more people might be able to relate to,
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.480]   that certain things and people smell delicious.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.920]   Even mothers describing the smell of their baby's head.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.920]   - Of course, a mother in mass.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.320]   I mean, our own babies when they're in their necks,
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.800]   that's the magical place.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.640]   - Their neck.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.600]   - The back of their neck.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.440]   - There you go.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.520]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.540]   I have a grandchild now,
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:05.460]   so I know exactly what Rio, that's his name, smells like.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.360]   - Okay, so more beautiful examples.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.180]   It's always more fun to think about the beautiful,
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.520]   positive, the repetitive examples.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.120]   The smell of the back of your grandson's neck.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:15.960]   - Yes.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.800]   - You could get more specific than that,
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.120]   but not a lot more specific.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.080]   So what is going on in terms of the combination
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.600]   of odor and taste,
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   given that these two systems are so different?
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.620]   - Yes, and they come together.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:35.700]   Ultimately, there is a place in the brain
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.960]   where they come together to integrate the two
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   into what we would call that sensory experience.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.180]   And I'll tell you an experiment that you could do
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.760]   that demonstrates this.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.940]   I think it's good for your audience here
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.280]   to get a sense of how we approach these problems
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.080]   so that we can get meaningful scientific answers.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.040]   We know where the taste cortex is in the brain.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.160]   They're in two different places.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.640]   We can go to each of these two cortices,
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.480]   put color traces, we put green in one,
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.940]   we put red in the other,
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:21.920]   and we see where the colors go to.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.040]   That's a reflection of where those neurons
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:29.040]   are projecting to into their next targets.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.240]   Once they get the signal,
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.220]   where do they send the signal to?
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:37.440]   And then we reason that if odor and taste come together
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.920]   somewhere in the brain,
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.560]   we should find an area that now
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.700]   it's getting red and green color.
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.940]   And we found such an area.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:51.100]   And next, we anticipated, we hypothesized
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:55.220]   that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse,
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.460]   corresponding area in the brain of humans,
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:02.460]   that integrates odor and taste.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.620]   It's known, the term normally used
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.020]   is multisensory integration.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.940]   And if this is true, we could do the following experiment.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:17.900]   We can train a mouse to lick sweet,
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:23.940]   and if they guess correctly
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.820]   that that is supposed to be sweet,
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:29.780]   they should go now to the right port,
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.720]   to the right side to get a water reward.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:38.100]   If they go to the left when it was sweet,
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.700]   then they're incorrect and they get no reward.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.820]   And they actually get a time out.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.580]   Now the mice are thirsty,
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.980]   so they're very motivated to perform.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.400]   And if you repeat this task a hundred times,
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.080]   a hundred trials, incredibly enough,
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.020]   this animal learned to recognize the sweet
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:00.060]   and execute the right action.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:05.020]   And by their action, we now are being told
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.040]   what that animal is tasting.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.300]   We can make it more interesting
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.760]   and we can give them sweet and bitter
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.660]   and say if it's sweet, go to the right
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.360]   and if it's bitter, go to the left.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.500]   And after you train them, this mice with 90% accuracy
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:22.220]   will tell you when you randomize now the stimuli,
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.220]   what was sweet and what was bitter.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.580]   All right.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.480]   We can now do the same experiment,
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:31.000]   but now mix taste with odor.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.980]   And say, if you got odor alone,
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.380]   go to the right or push this lever in mice.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.080]   If you get taste alone, go to this other part
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.480]   or push this other lever.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.560]   And if you get the two together, do this something else.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.020]   And if you train the mice,
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.700]   the mice are able now to report back to you
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.700]   when it's sensing taste alone, odor alone or the mix.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.840]   Make sense?
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.660]   - Makes sense.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.340]   - So we can go to the brain of these mice
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:13.780]   and go to this area that we now uncover, discover
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:17.140]   as being the site of multi-sensor integration
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.140]   between taste and odor and silence it.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:25.740]   Prevent it from being activated experimentally.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.520]   And if that area really represented
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.600]   the integration of these two,
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.140]   the animal should still be able to recognize the taste alone.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.180]   They still should be able to recognize the odor alone,
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:42.980]   but should be incapable now to recognize the mix.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   And exactly as predicted, that's exactly what you get.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.220]   All right?
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:54.460]   - The brain is basically a series of engineered circuits.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.000]   Complex, you got it.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   And our task is to figure out how can we extract
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:07.380]   this amazing architecture of these circuits
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.020]   in a way that we can begin to uncover
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:12.980]   the mysteries of the brain.
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.940]   - And why certain people's breath tastes so good
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.780]   and other people's not so good.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.020]   - So I never answered that,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:22.100]   but I told you how we can figure out
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.660]   where in the brain is happening.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:27.420]   - As we've been having this discussion,
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:31.100]   I thought a few times about similarities
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.100]   to the visual system or differences to the visual system.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.260]   The visual system, there are a couple of phenomenon
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:41.120]   that I wonder if they also exist in the taste system.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.680]   In the visual system, we know, for instance,
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.580]   that if you look at something long enough
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.020]   and activate the given receptors long enough,
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.340]   that object will actually disappear.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.740]   We offset this with little micro eye movements, et cetera,
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.740]   but the principle is a fundamental one,
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.780]   this habituation or desensitization.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.660]   Everyone seems to call it something different,
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.680]   but you get the idea, of course.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:04.140]   In the taste system, I'm certainly familiar
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:05.860]   with eating something very, very sweet
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.900]   for the first time in a long time,
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.860]   and it tastes very sweet.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.620]   But a few more licks, a few more bites,
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.320]   and now it tastes not as sweet.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.900]   With olfaction, I'm familiar with the odor in a room
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.900]   I don't like or I like, and then it disappearing.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.200]   So similar phenomenon.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.060]   Where does that occur?
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:28.960]   And can you imagine a sort of system
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.600]   by which people could leverage that?
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.840]   Because I do think that most people
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.740]   are interested in eating not more sugar, but less sugar.
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.680]   - I think we have better ways to approach that,
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.520]   and we can transition from taste into these other circuits
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.520]   that makes sugar so extraordinarily impossible
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.540]   not to consume.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:54.800]   - Impossible.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.640]   - Exactly.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   So where does this desensitizing happens?
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.420]   That's the term that we use.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:09.400]   And it's, I think, happening at multiple stations.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:15.540]   It's happening at the receptor level,
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.100]   i.e. the cells in your tongue that are sensing that sugar.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:23.300]   As you activate this receptor,
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:27.020]   and it's triggering activity after activity after activity,
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.780]   eventually you exhaust the receptor.
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:33.720]   Again, I'm using terms which are extraordinarily loose.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:36.700]   - But for sake of this discussion, it's fine.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.540]   - For the sake of this discussion,
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.680]   the receptor gets to a point
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.100]   where it undergoes a set of changes, chemical changes,
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:49.780]   where it now signals far less efficiently,
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:54.660]   or it even gets removed from the surface of the cell.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:59.340]   And now what will happen is that the same amount of sugar
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:02.700]   will trigger far less of a response.
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:08.040]   And that is a huge side of this modulation.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.820]   And then the next, I believe,
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:14.620]   is the integrated, again, loss of signaling
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:18.380]   that happens by continuous activation of the circuit
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.860]   at each of these different neural stations.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.720]   You know, there is from the tongue to the ganglia,
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.740]   from the ganglia to the first station in the brainstem,
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.100]   a second station in the brainstem,
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:32.220]   to the thalamus, then to the cortex.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.140]   So there are multiple steps that this signal is traveling.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:37.840]   Now, you might say, why, this is a label line,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.020]   why do you need to have so many stations?
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.780]   And that's because the taste system is so important
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:48.020]   to ensure that you get what you need to survive,
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.900]   that it has to be subjected to modulation
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.140]   by the internal state.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:57.280]   And each of these nodes provides a new side
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.860]   to give it plasticity and modulation,
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:04.060]   not necessarily to change the way that something tastes,
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:09.500]   but to ensure that you consume more or less
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.840]   or differently of what you need.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.220]   I'm gonna give you one example
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.400]   of how the internal state changes
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.100]   the way the taste system works.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:24.320]   Salt is very appetitive at low concentrations,
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.860]   and that's because we need it.
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:31.000]   It's our electrolyte balance requires salt,
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.060]   every one of their neurons uses salt
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.300]   as the most important of the ions,
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.900]   you know, with potassium to ensure
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.260]   that you can transfer these electrical signals
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.760]   within and between neurons.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:48.440]   But at high concentrations, let's say ocean water,
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.800]   it's incredibly aversive.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.720]   And we all know this because we've gone to the ocean
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.360]   and then when you get it in your mouth, it's not that great.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:00.200]   However, if I salt deprive you,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.160]   and we can do this in experimental models quite readily,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.240]   now this incredibly high concentration of salt,
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:15.040]   one molar sodium chloride becomes amazingly appetitive
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:15.940]   and attractive.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:19.160]   What's going on in here?
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.480]   Your tongue is telling you this is horrible,
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:27.380]   but your brain is telling you, I don't care, you need it.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:34.720]   And this is what we call the modulation of the taste system
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.640]   by the internal state.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.400]   - And presumably if one is hungry enough,
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.400]   even uni will taste good.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.640]   Just kidding to me. - You hit it right
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.980]   on the money, no, no, this is exactly correct.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:50.980]   Or if you're thirsty and hungry, you suppress hunger
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:56.520]   so that you don't waste water molecules in digesting food.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.240]   Why?
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.360]   Because if you're thirsty and you have no water,
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.260]   you will die within a week or so.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.600]   But you can go on a hunger strike as long as you have water
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.240]   for months, because you're gonna eat up
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.560]   all your energy reserves.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.040]   Water is a different story.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:21.000]   So you could see that there are multiple layers at which
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.320]   the taste system that guides our drive and our motivation
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:32.360]   to consume the nutrients we need has to be modulated
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.780]   in response to the internal state.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.000]   And of course, internal state itself has to be modulated
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.160]   by the external world.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.740]   And so that I think is a reason why,
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.000]   what could otherwise would have been
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.320]   an incredibly simple system from the tongue
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:53.800]   to the cortex in one gas wire, it's not.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.560]   Because you have to ensure that at each step,
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.440]   you give the system that level of flexibility
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.000]   or what we call in neuroscience, plasticity.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.860]   - I think we're headed into the gut.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.700]   - All right.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.920]   - I have a question that has just been on my mind
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.960]   for a bit now, because I was drinking this water
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   and it has essentially no taste.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.300]   - Yes.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.880]   - Is there any kind of signal for the absence of taste
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.520]   despite having something in the mouth?
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.040]   And here is why I ask, what I'm thinking about is saliva.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.640]   And while it's true that if I eat a lot
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.060]   of very highly palatable foods,
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:37.600]   that does change how I experience more bland foods.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.000]   I must confess when I eat a lot
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.540]   of these highly processed foods,
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.740]   I don't particularly like them.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.120]   I tend to crave healthier foods,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.880]   but that's probably for contextual reasons
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.960]   about nutrients, et cetera.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.580]   But I could imagine an experiment where-
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.200]   - Is there a taste of no taste?
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.640]   - Right, is there a taste of no taste?
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.220]   Because in the visual system there is, right?
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.520]   You close the eyes and you start getting increases
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.020]   in activity in the visual system as opposed to decreases,
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:02.580]   which often surprises people.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.720]   But there are reasons for that because everything
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.160]   is about signal to noise, signal to background.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160]   And it's a good question.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.880]   I can tell you that most of our work is trying to focus
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   on how the taste system works, not how it doesn't work.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.160]   - Well, but- - I know, yes we do.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.280]   - I know you're being playful.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.720]   And I knew when inviting you here today,
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.400]   I was setting myself up for it.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.080]   I actually, on a different-
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.200]   - We're trying to learn things.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.280]   - Yeah, I know. - However-
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.680]   - All right, listen, I was weaned in this system of,
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.560]   and I'll say it here for the second.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.800]   Actually, I recorded a podcast recently
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.560]   with a very prominent podcast at Lex Friedman Podcast.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.160]   And I made reference to the so-called
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.560]   New York Neuroscience Mafia.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.980]   I won't say whether or not we are sitting in the presence
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:46.240]   of the New York Neuroscience Mafia member,
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.980]   but in any event, I know the sorts of ribbing
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.160]   that they provide.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.160]   For those listening, this is the kind of hazing that happens,
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.040]   benevolent hazing in academia.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:57.880]   I'm the target.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.520]   - Of course, it's- - It's a sign of love.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.160]   - Exactly. - He's gonna tell me that.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.520]   - And it's always about the science in the end.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.840]   - Right, but-
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.360]   - It's an interesting question.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.960]   Look, I don't know the answer.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   And I don't even know how I would explore it
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.960]   in a way that it will rigorously teach me.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.720]   But-
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.800]   - Let me tell you why I'm asking,
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.400]   and then I'll offer an experiment
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.160]   that I'd love to see someone in your class do.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.560]   I'm thinking about saliva.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.600]   - Yes, no, no, no, but that we can figure it out.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.800]   - Right, but the question is whether or not
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   the saliva in a fed state is distinct from the saliva
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.880]   in an unfed state, such that it modulates-
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:48.720]   - It's not.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:49.560]   - The sensitivity of the receptors.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560]   - That experiment has been done, no.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.400]   - It has been done.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.460]   And so the answer is no.
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.300]   - It's not, yeah.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:54.800]   And the way you could do the experiment
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.260]   is because we use artificial saliva.
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:59.100]   - There's such a thing.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.720]   I know there's artificial tears, but-
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.660]   (laughing)
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.860]   - No, no, we, I don't mean that you go to Walgreens
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.900]   and you get, I mean, we in my laboratory,
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.780]   we know the composition of saliva,
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.040]   and so you can make such a thing.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.040]   And you can take, you know, taste cells in culture
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:20.420]   or in a tongue where you wash it out of,
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.340]   and then you can apply artificial saliva.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.820]   And what happens is that the system is being engineered
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:31.820]   to desensitize, to become agnostic,
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:35.520]   for saliva to become invisible.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.380]   And there is no difference on the state of the animal.
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.020]   - Great, well, this is the reason to do experiments.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:42.860]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.820]   - So it doesn't defeat any grand hypothesis.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:47.340]   It's just a pure curiosity.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.160]   So-
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.940]   - You know that curiosity kills the cut, yeah?
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.780]   - I do.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.020]   (laughing)
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:56.500]   But saves the career of a scientist.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.340]   - Every single time.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:58.860]   - That's what drives us, absolutely.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:27:59.700]   - Every single time.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.740]   - It's the story of our lives.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]   - Exactly.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:05.340]   Okay, so if it's not saliva, and apparently it is not,
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:09.700]   what about internal state?
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:14.000]   And what aspects of the internal milieu are relevant?
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.180]   Because there's autonomic, there's asleep and awake,
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.140]   there's stress.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:20.260]   One of the questions that I got from hundreds of people
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.980]   when I solicited questions in advance of this episode was,
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.140]   why do I crave sugar when I'm stressed, for instance?
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:27.220]   And that could be contextual,
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.820]   but what are the basic elements?
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:30.700]   - Because it makes us feel good, by the way.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.540]   We'll get to that.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.200]   That's the answer.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   It activates what I'm going to generically refer to
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.180]   as reward pleasure centers
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:48.180]   in a way that dramatically changes our internal state.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.680]   This is, you know, why do we eat a gallon of ice cream
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.460]   when we're very depressed, yeah?
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.100]   In fact, this is a good segue
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:59.800]   to go into this entirely different world, yeah?
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.800]   Of the body telling your brain what you need,
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:11.020]   in important things like sugar and fat, yeah?
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.440]   Okay, but anyways, go ahead.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.580]   You were going to ask something.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.720]   - Well, no, I would like to discuss
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.820]   the most basic elements of internal state,
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.560]   in particular, the ones that are below
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.140]   our conscious detection.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:26.820]   And this is, of course, is a segue
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.180]   into this incredible landscape,
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:31.060]   which is the gut-brain axis,
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:35.540]   which I think 15 years ago was almost a,
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:38.340]   maybe it was a couple posters at a meeting.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.740]   And then now I believe you and others,
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.140]   there are companies, there have companies,
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:49.140]   there are active research programs, and beautiful work.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:50.800]   Maybe you could describe some of that work
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.740]   that you and others have been involved in.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:56.440]   And a lot of the listeners of this podcast
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.300]   will have heard of the gut-brain axis,
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.580]   and there are a lot of misconceptions
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.580]   about the gut-brain axis.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.140]   Many people think that this means
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.740]   that we think with our stomach
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:08.740]   because of the quote-unquote gut feeling aspect,
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.380]   but I'd love for you to talk about
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.740]   the aspects of gut-brain signaling
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.820]   that drive or change our perceptions and behaviors
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.300]   that are completely beneath our awareness.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.780]   - Yes, excellent.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:24.620]   So let me begin maybe by stating
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:29.260]   that the brain needs to monitor
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:32.620]   the state of every one of our organs.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:35.960]   It has to do it.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.300]   This is the only way that the brain can ensure
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:44.440]   that every one of those organs are working together
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.320]   in a way that we have healthy physiology.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.680]   Now, this monitoring of the brain
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.320]   has been known for a long time,
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.680]   but I think what hadn't been fully appreciated,
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.220]   that this is a two-way highway
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:03.080]   where the brain is not only monitoring,
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:09.080]   but is now modulating back what the body needs to do.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.880]   And that includes all the way from monitoring
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.120]   the frequency of heartbeats
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.540]   and the way that inspiration and aspirations
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.400]   in the breathing cycle operate
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.700]   to what happens when you ingest sugar and fat.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:32.780]   Now, let me give you an example again
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:37.780]   of how the brain can take
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:45.700]   what we would refer to contextual associations
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.200]   and transform it into incredible changes
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.040]   in physiology and metabolism.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.180]   Remember Pavlov?
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.760]   So Pavlov, in his classical experiments
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.180]   in conditioning, associative conditioning,
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:03.940]   he would take a bell, it would ring the bell
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:06.180]   every time he was going to feed the dog.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:10.760]   And eventually, the dog learned to associate
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.600]   the ringing of the bell with food coming.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   Now, the first incredible finding he made
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.880]   is the fact that the dog now,
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.440]   in the presence of the bell alone,
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.940]   will start to salivate.
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:30.640]   And we will call that, neurologically speaking,
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.900]   an anticipatory response.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.600]   Okay, I could understand it.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.440]   I get it.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:40.360]   Neurons in the brain that form that association
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.840]   now represent food is coming
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:46.760]   and they're sending a signal to motor neurons
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.040]   to go into your salivary glands to squeeze them
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:55.040]   so you release saliva because you know food is coming.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.040]   But what's even more remarkable
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.320]   is that those animals are also releasing insulin
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.260]   in response to a bell.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:07.040]   Okay.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:13.060]   This illustrates one part of this two-way highway,
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.760]   the highway going down.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.260]   Somehow the brain created these associations
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.560]   and there are neurons in your brain now
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.940]   that no food is coming and send a signal somehow
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.540]   all the way down to your pancreas
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.460]   that now it says release insulin
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:31.560]   because sugar is coming down.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:35.460]   All right, this goes back to the magic of the brain.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:40.320]   It's a never-ending source of both joy and intrigue.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.920]   How the hell do they do this?
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.200]   Okay.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.240]   I mean the neurons, eh?
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.760]   - No, I share your delight and fascination.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.640]   There's not a day or a lecture
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.040]   or some talks are better than others
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.400]   or where I don't sit back and just think
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.960]   it's absolutely amazing.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.800]   - How?
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.140]   - It's amazing, it's amazing.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.800]   - Now, over the past dozen years,
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.020]   and with great force over the last five years.
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:12.860]   Now, the main highway that is communicating
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:16.140]   the state of the body with the brain
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.060]   has been uncovered,
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:23.680]   has been what we now refer to as the gut-brain axis,
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.780]   and the highway is a specific bundle of nerves,
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:31.780]   you know, which emerge from the vagal ganglia,
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:35.020]   the nodal ganglia, and so it's the vagus nerve
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:39.200]   that it's innervating the majority
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.960]   of the organs in your body.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.500]   It's monitoring their function,
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.880]   sending a signal to the brain,
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.380]   and now the brain going back down and saying,
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:52.200]   this is going all right, do this,
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.920]   or this is not going so well, do that.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.840]   - And I should point out, as you well know,
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.200]   every organ, spleen, pancreas, lung.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.900]   - They all must be monitored.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:09.180]   In fact, you know, I now, I have no doubt
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:12.480]   that diseases that we have normally associated
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.440]   with metabolism, physiology, and even immunity
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:23.200]   are likely to emerge as diseases,
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.940]   conditions, states of the brain.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.460]   I don't think obesity is a disease of metabolism.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:35.740]   I believe obesity is a disease of brain circuits.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.160]   - I do as well. - Yeah?
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.760]   And so this view that we have, you know,
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.220]   been working on for the longest time,
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.500]   because, you know, the molecules that we're dealing with
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.580]   are in the body, not in the head, you know,
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.820]   led us to view, of course, these issues and problems
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:58.500]   as being one of metabolism, physiology, and so forth.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:03.180]   They remain to be the carriers of the ultimate signal,
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:07.220]   but the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.380]   of this orchestra of physiology and metabolism.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.060]   All right, now let's go to the gut, brain, and sugar.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.660]   May we?
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.780]   - Please, please.
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.780]   No, I mean, the vagus nerve has, in popular culture,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.440]   has been kind of converted into this single meaning
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.100]   of calming pathways, mostly because,
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:38.560]   I actually have to tip my hat to the yogic community,
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.020]   was among the first to talk about vagus on and on and on.
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:47.260]   There are calming pathways, you know,
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:49.880]   so-called parasympathetic pathways within the vagus,
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.740]   but I think that the more we learn about the vagus,
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:57.020]   the more it seems like an entire set of neural connections
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.480]   as opposed to one nerve.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.680]   I just wanted to just mention that
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.000]   because I think a lot of people have heard about the vagus.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.520]   It turns out experimentally in the laboratory,
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.000]   many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.020]   to create states of alertness and arousal
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.720]   when animals or even people, believe it or not,
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.920]   are close to dying or going into coma.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.740]   Stimulation of the vagus is one of the ways
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:19.580]   to wake up the brain, counter to the idea
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.320]   that it's just this way of calming oneself down.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.040]   And also, of course, I mean,
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.680]   one has to be cautious there in that.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.680]   So the vagus nerve is made out of many thousands of fibers,
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:38.160]   you know, individual fibers that make this gigantic bundle.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.440]   And it's likely, as we're speaking,
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.820]   that each of these fibers carries
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.480]   a slightly different meaning, okay?
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:48.540]   Not necessarily one by one, maybe five fibers,
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:50.560]   10 fibers, 22, all right.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.000]   But they carry meaning that's associated
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.120]   with their specific task.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.800]   This group of fibers is telling the brain
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.920]   about the state of your heart.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.240]   This group of fiber is telling the brain
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.880]   about the state of your gut.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.040]   This is telling your brain about its nutritional state.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.960]   This, your pancreas.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.440]   This, your lungs.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:22.440]   And they are, again, to make the same simple example,
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.420]   the keys of this piano, okay?
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.320]   Yes, you're right, there is a lot of data
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.960]   showing that activating the entire vagal bundle
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:41.960]   has very meaningful effects in a wide range of conditions.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.920]   In fact, it's being used to treat untractable depression.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:50.180]   - Little stimulator.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.500]   - Epileptic seizures.
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:57.760]   But again, there are thousands of fibers
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.600]   carrying different functions.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.440]   So to some degree, you know, this is like
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:11.640]   turning the lights on the stadium
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:15.140]   because you need to illuminate
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.680]   where you lost your keys under your seat.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.680]   Yet 10,000 volts of 1,000 watts each have just come on.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:28.860]   Only one of these is pointing to where.
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:32.320]   And so I'm lucky enough that one of them
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.200]   happened to point to my side.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.940]   So here you activate the bundle of thousands of fibers.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.160]   I'm lucky enough that some of those
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.820]   happened to do something
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:48.040]   to make a meaningful difference in depression
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.580]   or to make a meaningful difference in epileptic.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:54.720]   But it should not be misconstrue
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:59.080]   as arguing that this broad activation
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:05.040]   has any type of selectivity or specificity.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.240]   We're just lucky enough
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.960]   that among all the things that are being done,
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.200]   some of those happen to change
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.640]   the biology of these processes.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.980]   Now, the reason this is relevant,
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:20.440]   because the magic of this gut-brain axis
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:24.560]   is the fact that you have these thousands of fibers
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.260]   really doing different functions.
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:32.260]   And our goal, and along with many other great scientists,
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.480]   including Steve Liverless, that started a lot of,
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.080]   you know, this molecular dissection
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.080]   on this vagal gut-brain communication line at Harvard,
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.520]   is trying to uncover what are each of those lines doing?
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.900]   What are each of those keys of this piano playing?
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.160]   - What's the latest there?
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.020]   Just as a brief update, I know Stephen Lee release,
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.980]   I think I was there when he got his Howard Hughes
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:06.820]   and I did not.
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:07.740]   That was fun.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:10.100]   Always great to get beat by excellent people.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:11.380]   - First of all, I'm happy you did them
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:15.480]   because that way you can focus on this amazing podcast.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.040]   - Thank you, that's very gracious of you.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.120]   It's always feels better.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.220]   It's not good to get beat out by excellent people.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:26.800]   Stephen is second to none.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.960]   And he is defining, as you said,
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:31.960]   the molecular constituents of different elements
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:33.620]   of these many, many fibers.
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.540]   Is there an update there?
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:37.040]   Are they finding multiple parallel pathways?
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.040]   - They are, they are.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.240]   Some that control heartbeat,
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.040]   some that control the respiratory cycle,
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:48.040]   some that might be involved in a gastric movement.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.400]   You know, this notion that you're full
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.320]   and you feel full in part because your gut gets distended,
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.680]   your stomach, for example.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.880]   And then there are little sensors that are reading that
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.720]   and telling the brain you're full, yeah.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.500]   - So the textbooks will soon change
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.660]   on the basis of the liberalese and other work.
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:13.820]   - In essence, I think we are learning enough
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:18.820]   about these lines that could really help
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:25.900]   put together this holistic view of how the brain,
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:32.280]   it's truly changing body physiology, metabolism, and immunity.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.800]   The part that hasn't been yet developed
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.000]   and that it needs a fair amount of work,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000]   but it's an exciting, thrilling journey of discovery
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.080]   is how the signal comes back to now change that biology.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.000]   You know, the example I gave you before with Pavlov's dog.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.900]   All right, I figure out, you know,
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:00.680]   how the association created this link between the bell,
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.000]   but then how does the brain tell the pancreas
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.860]   to release in the right amount of insulin?
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.760]   Okay, so tell me, (laughs)
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.760]   let me tell you about the gut-brain axis
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.620]   and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat.
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:27.000]   Insatiable for sugar and quenchable for fat.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.440]   And this is a story about the fundamental difference
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.920]   between liking and wanting.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:46.080]   Liking sugar is the function of the taste system.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:53.500]   And it's not really liking sugar, it's liking sweet.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.680]   Wanting sugar, our never-ending appetite for sugar
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:08.880]   is the story of the gut-brain axis, liking versus wanting.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:14.360]   And this work is work of my own laboratory,
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.520]   you know, that began long ago
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.020]   when we discovered the sweet receptors.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:25.000]   And you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   So in essence, these animals will be unable to taste sweet.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.680]   A life without sweetness, how horrible.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:42.160]   And if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet,
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.380]   and we're gonna put either sugar or an artificial sweetener.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.280]   All right, they both are sweet.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.840]   They have slightly different tastes,
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.280]   but that's simply because artificial sweeteners
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.600]   have some off tastes.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.580]   But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned,
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:02.980]   they both activate the same receptor,
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.700]   trigger the same signal.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:07.260]   And if you give an animal an option
[01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:11.920]   of a bottle containing sugar or a sweetener versus water,
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.600]   this animal will drink 10 to one
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.000]   from the bottle containing sweet.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.120]   That's the taste system.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.800]   Animal goes, samples each one, leaks a couple of leaks,
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:24.120]   and then says, uh-uh, that's the one I want
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.320]   because it's repetitive and because I love it.
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.600]   - So it prefers sugar to artificial sweetener?
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.960]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.920]   - Equally artificial. - In this experiment,
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.760]   this experiment, I'm gonna put only sweet in one bottle.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.320]   And it could be either sugar or artificial sweetener.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.000]   It doesn't matter which one.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.040]   Okay, we're gonna do the next experiment
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.360]   where we separate those two.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.600]   For now, it's sweet versus water.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.440]   - Okay.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.200]   - And sweet means sweet, not sugar.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.800]   Sweet means anything that tastes sweet, all right?
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:59.240]   And sugar is one example, and Splenda is another example.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.440]   - Aspartame, monk fruit, stevia, doesn't matter.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:06.480]   - Yeah, I mean, there's some that only humans can taste,
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.940]   mice cannot taste because their receptors
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:12.560]   between humans and mice are different.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.960]   But we have put the human receptor into mice.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.040]   We engineer mice and we completely humanize
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.880]   this mouse's taste world, all right?
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.500]   But for the purpose of this conversation,
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.460]   we're only comparing sweet versus water.
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:35.760]   An option, my goodness, they will leak to know
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:40.680]   from the sweet side, 10 to one at least versus the water.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.520]   Make sense?
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.760]   All right, now we're gonna take the mice
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.580]   and we're gonna genetically engineer it
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:49.660]   to remove the sweet receptors.
[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:53.720]   So these mice no longer have in their oral cavity
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:56.760]   any sensors that can detect sweetness,
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.240]   be that sugar molecule, be it an artificial sweetener,
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.080]   be it anything else that tastes sweet.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.340]   And if you give these mice an option
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:09.400]   between sweet versus water, sugar versus water,
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:11.860]   artificial sweetener versus water,
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.540]   it will drink equally well from both
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:15.540]   because it cannot tell them apart.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.280]   Because it doesn't have the receptors for sweet,
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.500]   so that sweet bottle tastes just like water.
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.520]   Make sense?
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.820]   - Makes sense. - Very good.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.180]   Now we're gonna do the experiment with sugar.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.120]   From now on, let's focus on sugar.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.500]   So I'm gonna give a mouse a home.
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:34.140]   Sugar versus water.
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.660]   Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar,
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:40.060]   very little from the water.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.220]   Knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them.
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:46.100]   Mouse can no longer tell them apart
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.600]   and they will drink from both.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:54.180]   But if I keep the mouse in that cage for the next 48 hours,
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:59.940]   something extraordinary happens when I come 48 hours later
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.740]   and I see what the mouse is leaking or drinking from.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:06.880]   That mouse is drinking almost exclusively
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.080]   from the sugar bottle.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.060]   How could this be?
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.520]   It cannot taste it.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:15.360]   Doesn't have sweet receptors.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:21.060]   During those 48 hours, the mouse learn
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:23.760]   that there is something in that bottle
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:26.200]   that makes me feel good.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.140]   And that is the bottle I want to consume.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:34.220]   Now, how does the mouse identify that bottle?
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.020]   It does so by using other sensory features.
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:39.600]   The smell of the bottle.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.480]   The texture of the solution inside.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:46.100]   Sugar at high concentrations is kind of goopy.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:51.840]   The side-ness in which the bottle is in the cage.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.420]   It doesn't matter what.
[01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:56.800]   But the mouse realize there is something there
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.700]   that makes me feel good and that's what I want.
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.700]   And that is the fundamental basis
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:10.700]   of our unquenchable desire and our craving for sugar
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:14.420]   and is mediated by the God brain axis.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:18.380]   The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:23.880]   Immediately suggesting a post-ingestive effect.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.940]   So we reason if this is true and it's the God brain axis
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:33.220]   that's driving sugar preference,
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:37.380]   then there should be a group of neurons in the brain
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:41.880]   that are responding to post-ingestive sugar.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.260]   And lo and behold, we identify a group of neurons
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.140]   in the brain that does this and these neurons
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:53.140]   receive their input directly from the God brain axis.
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:55.820]   - From other neurons.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:56.660]   - You got it.
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:01.200]   And so what's happening is that sugar
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:04.800]   is recognized normally by the tongue,
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.240]   activates an repetitive response.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:12.300]   Now you ingest it and now it activates a selective group
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:17.300]   of cells in your intestines that now send a signal
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.200]   to the brain via the vagal ganglia
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:25.400]   that says I got what I need.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.200]   The tongue doesn't know that you got what you need.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.900]   It only knows that you tasted it.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:33.940]   This knows that you got to the point
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:36.860]   that it's going to be used, which is the gut.
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:41.820]   And now it sends the signal to now reinforce
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.300]   the consumption of this thing
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:46.860]   because this is the one that I needed.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:49.020]   Sugar, source of energy.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:51.120]   - And are these neurons in the gut?
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.600]   - So these are not neurons in the gut.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.580]   So these are gut cells that recognize the sugar molecule,
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:00.300]   send a signal and that signal is received
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:02.020]   by the vagal neuron directly.
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:02.860]   - Got it.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:07.220]   - And this sends a signal through the gut brain axis
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:11.500]   to the cell bodies of these neurons in the vagal ganglia
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.780]   and from there to the brain stem
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:18.660]   to now trigger the preference for sugar.
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:19.580]   - Two questions.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:23.300]   One, you mentioned that these cells that detect sugar
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.660]   within the gut are actually within the intestine.
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:27.340]   You didn't say stomach.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:28.220]   - Which surprised me.
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:31.100]   I always think gut as stomach, but of course, intestine.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.260]   - They're intestine because that's where
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.660]   all the absorption happens.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:35.380]   So you want the signal.
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:36.620]   You see, you want the brain to know
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:41.280]   that you had successful ingestion and breakdown
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.400]   of whatever you consume into the building blocks of life.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:50.060]   And you know, glucose, amino acids, fat.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:53.940]   And so you want to make sure that once they are in the form
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:56.380]   that intestines can now absorb them,
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:51:59.580]   is where you get the signal back saying,
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:01.620]   this is what I want, okay?
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:04.120]   Now, let me just take it one step further.
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:09.940]   And this now, sugar molecules activates
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:12.540]   this unique gut brain circuit
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:17.540]   that now drives the development of our preference for sugar.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:23.700]   Now, a key element of this circuit
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:28.580]   is that the sensors in the gut that recognize the sugar
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:33.180]   do not recognize artificial sweeteners at all.
[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:35.120]   - Right, because their nutrient value
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.040]   is uncoupled from the taste.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:42.260]   - Generically speaking, one can make that by this
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:44.220]   because it's a very different type of receptor.
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.060]   - I see.
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.620]   - It turns out that it's not the tongue receptors
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:48.040]   being used in the gut.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:50.540]   It's a completely different molecule
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:54.360]   that only recognizes the glucose molecule,
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.420]   not artificial sweeteners.
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:01.420]   This has a profound impact on the effect
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:07.220]   of ultimately artificial sweeteners in curbing our appetite,
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:12.260]   our craving, our insatiable desire for sugar.
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:16.780]   Since they don't activate the gut brain axis,
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:23.080]   they'll never satisfy the craving for sugar like sugar does.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:27.760]   And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.760]   have failed in the market to curve our appetite,
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:36.540]   our need, our desire for sugar
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:40.320]   is because they beautifully work on the tongue,
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:47.140]   the liking to recognize sweet versus non-sweet,
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.120]   but they fail to activate the key sensors in the gut
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.600]   that now inform the brain, you got sugar,
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.720]   no need to crave anymore.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:06.720]   - So the issue of wanting, can we relate that
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:10.360]   to a particular set of neurochemicals upstream?
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:13.400]   So the pathway is, so glucose is activating
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.440]   these cells in the gut through the vagus
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:19.860]   that's communicated through presumably the nodose ganglion
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:21.100]   and up into the brainstem.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.140]   - Very good, and from there, where does it go?
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:23.980]   - Yeah, where is it going?
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.820]   What is the substrate of wanting?
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:29.420]   I, you know, of course I think molecules like dopamine,
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:31.480]   craving, there's a book even called
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:34.400]   "The Molecule of More," et cetera, et cetera.
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:37.720]   Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know,
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.520]   because it evokes both a sense of pleasure-ish,
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.920]   but also a sense of desiring more, of craving.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.440]   So if I understand you correctly,
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:49.800]   artificial sweeteners, and I agree,
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.140]   are failing as a means to satisfy sugar craving
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:55.920]   at the level of nutrient sensing.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:02.640]   And yet, if we trigger this true sugar-evoked
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:07.320]   wanting pathway too much, and we've all experienced this,
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.560]   then we eat sugar and we find ourselves
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:10.900]   wanting more and more sugar.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:13.800]   Now that could also be insulin dysregulation,
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.660]   but can we uncouple those?
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:16.820]   - Yeah, I mean, look.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:23.440]   We have a mega problem
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.800]   with overconsumption of sugar and fat.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:32.460]   You know, we're facing a unique time in our evolution
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:38.680]   where diseases of malnutrition are due to overnutrition.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:42.600]   I mean, how nuts is that, eh?
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.040]   I mean, historically, diseases of malnutrition
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.200]   have always been linked to undernutrition.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:54.660]   And so we need to come up with strategies
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:57.720]   that can meaningfully change
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:05.580]   the activation of these circuits that control our wanting,
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:10.860]   certainly in the populations at risk.
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:15.860]   And this gut-brain circuit that ultimately,
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:25.380]   it's the lines of communication that are informing the brain,
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.640]   the presence of intestinal sugar, in this example,
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.380]   it's a very important target in the way we think about,
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:36.060]   is there a way that we can meaningfully
[01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:37.980]   modulate these circuits?
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:42.980]   So I make your brain think that you got satisfied
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:47.520]   with sugar, even though I'm not giving you sugar.
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:49.760]   - So that immediately raises the question,
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.640]   are the receptors for glucose in these gut cells
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.780]   susceptible to other things that are healthier for us?
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:01.260]   - That's very good, excellent idea.
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:06.020]   And I think an important goal will be to come up
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:11.020]   with a strategy and identify those very means
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:15.620]   that allow us to modulate the circuits in a way that,
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:20.560]   certainly for all of those where this is a big issue,
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:25.920]   it can really have a dramatic impact
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.440]   in improving human health.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.860]   - I could be wrong about this, and I'm happy to be wrong.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:34.660]   I'm often wrong and told I'm wrong.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.000]   That we have cells within our gut
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.420]   that don't just sense sugar, glucose, to be specific,
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:44.540]   but also cells within our gut
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:47.260]   that sense amino acids and fatty acids.
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:52.020]   I could imagine a scenario where one could train themselves
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:55.740]   to feel immense amounts of satiety
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.660]   from the consumption of foods
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:01.460]   that are rich in essential fatty acids, amino acids,
[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:06.340]   perhaps less caloric or less insulin-disregulating
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.300]   than sugar.
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:09.540]   I'll use myself as an example.
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:12.420]   I've always enjoyed sweets, but in the last few years,
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:15.500]   for some reason, I've started to lose my appetite for them,
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:18.140]   probably because I just don't eat them anymore.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:20.100]   At first, that took some restriction.
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:21.900]   Now I just don't even think about it.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:24.920]   - Yeah, and you're not reinforcing the circuits.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:28.820]   And so you're in essence are removing yourself,
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:32.580]   but you tend to be the exception.
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:37.580]   We have a huge, incredible large number of people
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:41.260]   that are being continuously exposed
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.740]   to highly processed foods.
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:46.580]   - And hidden, so-called hidden sugars.
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:48.640]   - They don't even have to be hidden.
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:49.620]   It's right there.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:51.140]   - Hiding in plain sight.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:52.020]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:54.220]   So much is made of hidden sugars
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:57.060]   that we often overlook that they are.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:58.860]   There are also the overt sugars.
[01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:02.060]   - Yeah, I mean, we can have a long discussion
[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:05.700]   on the importance of coming up with strategies
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:10.080]   that could meaningfully change public health
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.780]   when it comes to nutrition.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:18.200]   But I wanna just go back to the notion of these brain centers
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:23.200]   that are ultimately the ones that are being activated
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.500]   by these essential nutrients.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.100]   So sugar, fat, and amino acids
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:33.100]   are building blocks of our diets.
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:36.580]   And this is across all animal species.
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:39.780]   So it's not unreasonable then to assume
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:43.500]   that dedicated brain circuits would have evolved
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:46.780]   to ensure their recognition,
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:54.100]   their ingestion, and the reinforcement
[01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:56.800]   that that is what I need.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:03.740]   And indeed, you know, animals evolved these two systems.
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:11.980]   One is the taste system that allows you to recognize them
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:15.140]   and trigger these predetermined hardwired
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:17.820]   immediate responses, yes?
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:20.700]   Oh my goodness, this tastes so good, it's so sweet.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:23.540]   I personally have a sweet tooth, may I add.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:25.900]   And you know, oh my God, this is so delicious,
[02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.780]   it's fatty or umami, recognizing amino acids.
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.980]   So that's the liking pathway, yeah?
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:38.300]   But in the wisdom of evolution,
[02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:41.900]   that's good, but doesn't quite do it.
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:43.980]   You wanna make sure that these things get to the place
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:48.120]   where they're needed, and they're not needed in your tongue.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.460]   They are needed in your intestines
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.700]   where they're going to be absorbed
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:56.500]   as the nutrients that will support life.
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:01.560]   And the brain wants to know this.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:05.100]   And he wants to know it in a way
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.940]   that he can now form the association
[02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:11.620]   between that that I just tasted
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:16.020]   is what got where it needs to be,
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.880]   and it makes me feel good.
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:23.780]   And so now, next time that I have to choose
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.700]   what should I eat,
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:31.660]   that association now guides me to that's the one I want.
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:34.960]   I want that fruit, not that fruit.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:39.500]   I want those leaves, not those leaves,
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:42.780]   because these are the ones that activate the right circuits,
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:44.380]   that ensure that the right nutrients
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:46.620]   got to the right place, and told the brain
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:50.860]   this is what I want and need.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:53.380]   Are we on?
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:54.740]   - We're on.
[02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:57.620]   One thing that intrigues me and puzzles me
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:01.060]   is that this effect took a couple of days,
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:03.820]   at least in mice, and the sensation,
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:06.020]   ah, sorry, the perception of taste-
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:06.860]   - Is immediate.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:09.140]   - Is immediate, and yet this is a slow system.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:13.800]   And so in a beautiful way, but in a kind of mysterious way,
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.420]   the brain is able to couple the taste of a sweet drink
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:20.380]   with the experience of nutrient extraction in the gut
[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:24.800]   under a context where the mouse and the human
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.620]   is presumably ingesting other things,
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:29.060]   smelling other mice, smelling other people.
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:30.260]   That's incredible.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:33.300]   - Yeah, but you have to think of it not as humans.
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:38.300]   Remember, we inherited the circuits of our ancestors,
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:44.860]   and they, through evolutionary, from their ancestors.
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:48.460]   And we haven't had that many years
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:50.800]   to have fundamentally changed
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:53.160]   in many of these hard-wired circuits.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:57.940]   So forget, as humans, let's look at animals in the wild,
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:01.380]   okay, which is easier now to comprehend the logic.
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:08.620]   Why should this take a long time of continual reinforcement,
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:12.040]   given that I can taste it in a second?
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.860]   You wanna make sure that this source of sugar,
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:21.660]   for example, in the wild, is the best, is the richest,
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:24.300]   is the one where I get the most energy
[02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:29.100]   for the least amount of extraction,
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:32.060]   the least amount of work.
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:37.020]   I wanna identify rich sources of sugar.
[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:40.900]   And if the system simply responds immediately
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:43.460]   to the first sugar that gets to your gut,
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:48.460]   you're gonna form the association with those sources of food
[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:52.620]   which are not the ones that you should be eating from.
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:55.220]   - Don't fall in love with the first person you encounter.
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:58.380]   - Oh my goodness, exactly.
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:02.780]   And so, evolutionarily, by having the taste system
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:05.140]   giving you the immediate recognition,
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:08.820]   but then by forcing this gut-brain axis
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:13.820]   to reinforce it only when sustained repeated exposure
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:20.280]   has informed the brain, this is the one.
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.520]   You don't wanna form the association before.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:27.380]   And so, when we remove it from the context of,
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:30.980]   we just go to the supermarket.
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:36.100]   We're not hunting there in the wild where I need to form.
[02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:41.100]   And so, what's happening is that highly processed foods
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:46.500]   are hijacking, co-opting the circuits in a way
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:52.020]   that would have never happened in nature.
[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:55.380]   And then we not only find these things
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.380]   appetitive and palatable, but in addition,
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:02.140]   we are continuously reinforcing the wanting
[02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:04.240]   in a way that, oh my God, this is so great.
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.260]   What do I feel like eating?
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:07.240]   Let me have more of these.
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:09.140]   - You've just forever changed the way
[02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:12.460]   that I think about supermarkets and restaurants.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:16.460]   There are, understanding this fast signaling
[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.160]   and this slower signaling and the utility of having both
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.700]   makes me realize that supermarkets and restaurants
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:28.140]   are about the most unnatural thing for our system ever.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:31.980]   Almost the equivalent of living in small villages
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:35.260]   with very few suitable mates versus online dating,
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:36.100]   for instance.
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:38.100]   - Look, I'm not gonna make a judgment call there
[02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.060]   because they do serve an important purpose.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:41.300]   - I like restaurants too.
[02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:44.200]   - Yeah, but, and so do supermarkets, thank God.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:47.820]   I think they're not the culprits.
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.420]   I think the culprits, of course,
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:58.660]   are reliance on foods that are not necessarily healthy.
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:03.120]   - Now, going back to the supermarket,
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.880]   don't fall in love with the first, it need to work.
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:10.880]   You know, you take, you take a tangerine
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:20.460]   and you take an extract of tangerine
[02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:27.280]   that you used to cook that spike, let's say with sugar.
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:32.420]   And you equalize in both where they both provide
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:33.900]   the same amount of calories.
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:36.820]   If you eat them both,
[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:40.400]   they're gonna have a very different effect
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:45.540]   in your gut brain axis and your system.
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:48.080]   Once you make the extract and you process it
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:50.600]   and you add it processed sugar, you know,
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.920]   to use it now to cook, to add,
[02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:55.660]   to make it really sweet, tangerine thing.
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:07:00.220]   Now you're providing now a fully ready to use,
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:02.720]   broken down source of sugar.
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:09.480]   In the tangerine, that sugar, it's mixed in the complexity
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:15.420]   of a whole set of other chemical components.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:20.180]   Fiber, long chains of sugar molecules
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:24.900]   that need a huge amount of work by your stomach,
[02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:29.060]   your gut system to break it down.
[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:34.060]   So you're using a huge amount of energy to extract energy.
[02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:40.640]   And the balance, it's very different
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:45.640]   than when I take this process, highly extracted tangerine.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:48.940]   By the way, I use tangerines because I had a tangerine
[02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:50.100]   just before I came here.
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:52.940]   - Delicious, they are delicious.
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:57.940]   - And so this goes back to the issue of supermarkets.
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:03.500]   And so to some degree, you know, A, given a choice,
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.580]   you don't wanna eat processed, highly processed foods
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:08.920]   because everything's already been broken down for you.
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.100]   And so your system has no work.
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:15.660]   And so you are co-opting, hijacking the circuits
[02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:19.220]   in a way that they're being activated at a timescale
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:20.780]   that normally wouldn't happen.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.360]   This is why I often feel that,
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:27.580]   and I think a lot of data are now starting to support
[02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:31.380]   the idea that while indeed the laws of thermodynamics apply,
[02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:33.600]   calories ingested versus calories burned
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:35.760]   is a very real thing, right?
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:42.020]   That the appetite for certain foods
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:47.420]   and the wanting and the liking are phenomena
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:49.880]   of the nervous system, brain and gut
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:51.800]   as you've beautifully described.
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:54.700]   And that that changes over time,
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:57.460]   depending on how we are receiving these nutrients.
[02:08:57.460 --> 02:08:58.380]   - Absolutely.
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:03.380]   Look, we have a lot of work to do.
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:07.580]   I'm talking as a society.
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.940]   I'm not talking about you and I.
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:12.100]   - We also have a lot of work to do.
[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:16.540]   - No, I think understanding the circuits
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:20.660]   is giving us important insights
[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:25.280]   and how ultimately and hopefully we can improve human health
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:28.620]   and make a meaningful difference.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:35.740]   Now it's very easy to try to connect the dots,
[02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:38.640]   A to B, B to C, C to D.
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:41.860]   And I think there's a lot more complexity to it,
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:46.340]   but I do think that the lessons that are emerging
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:50.700]   out of understanding how the circuits operate
[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:55.700]   can ultimately inform how we deal with our diets
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:10:03.740]   in a way that we avoid what we're facing now as a society.
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:07.120]   I mean, it's nuts that the over nutrition
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:11.900]   happens to be such a prevalent problem.
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:13.660]   - And I also think the training of people
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:15.980]   who are thinking about metabolic science
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:18.580]   and metabolic disease is largely divorced
[02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:21.340]   from the training of the neuroscientist and vice versa.
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:22.660]   No one field is to blame,
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:26.740]   but I fully agree that the brain is the key
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:29.540]   or the nervous system to be more accurate
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:32.380]   is one of the key overlooked features.
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:33.260]   - Is the arbitrary.
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:38.280]   Ultimately is the arbiter of many of these pathways.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.780]   - As a final question and one which is simply
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:43.880]   to entertain my curiosity and the curiosity
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:48.880]   of the listeners, what is your absolute favorite food?
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:50.260]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:53.840]   - Taste, I should say.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:55.100]   - Yes.
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.400]   - Taste, to distinguish between taste
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.620]   and the nutritive value or lack thereof.
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:04.620]   - Yes, look, we, unlike every other animal species,
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:08.200]   eat for the enjoyment of it.
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:12.060]   It doesn't happen in the wild.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.160]   Most animals eat when they need to eat.
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:19.020]   Doesn't mean they don't enjoy it,
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:21.420]   but it's a completely different story, yeah?
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:27.780]   I have too many favorite foods
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:30.760]   because I enjoy the sensory experience.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:34.940]   Rather than the food itself, to me is the whole thing.
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:36.540]   It's from the present, look,
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:39.260]   there've been these experiments done in psychophysics, yeah?
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:42.480]   I'm gonna take a salad made out of 11 components.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.480]   And I'm gonna mix them all up in potpourri of greens
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:50.540]   and other things here.
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:52.160]   I mean, the other one, I'm gonna present it
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:54.240]   in a beautiful arrangement and I'm gonna put it
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:57.060]   behind a glass cabinet and I'm gonna sell them.
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:00.080]   And I'm gonna sell one for $2 and one for $8.
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:03.300]   Precisely the same ingredients,
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.240]   exactly the same amount of each.
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.500]   Ultimately, you're gonna mix them,
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.000]   they're all gonna be the same.
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:15.620]   And people will pay the $8 because, you know what?
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:18.340]   It evokes a different person.
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:22.660]   It gives you the feel that, oh my goodness,
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:24.540]   I'm gonna enjoy that salad.
[02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:29.440]   So going back to what is my favorite food.
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.440]   To me, eating is really a sensory journey.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:42.340]   I don't mean the everyday, let me have some chicken wings
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.640]   because I'm hungry.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:50.580]   But every piece, I think, has an important
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:58.500]   evoking sensory role.
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:03.940]   And so, in terms of categories of food,
[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:09.700]   I grew up in Chile, so meat has always been,
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:13.940]   but I eat it so seldom now.
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:14.780]   - Is that right?
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:17.140]   - Yeah, because I know that it's not necessarily
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:19.900]   the healthiest thing, red meat I'm talking about, yeah?
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:23.980]   And so I grew up eating it every day.
[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:28.260]   I'm talking seven days a week, Chile and Argentina,
[02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:32.160]   that's the mainstay of our diet, yeah?
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:38.220]   Now maybe I have red meat, I know, once every four weeks.
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:41.620]   - And you enjoy it.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:42.760]   - Oh, I love it.
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:46.180]   Part of it is because I haven't had it in four weeks, eh?
[02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:51.180]   But I love sushi, but I love the art of sushi.
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:56.540]   The whole thing, the way it's presented,
[02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:58.560]   it changes the way you taste it.
[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:06.180]   I love ethnic food, in particular.
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:07.300]   - You're in the right place.
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.140]   - You got it.
[02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:10.460]   That was the main reason I wanted to come to New York.
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:12.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.700]   - There's also that Columbia University that's-
[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:18.100]   - I came here because I wanted to be with people
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.740]   that are thinking about the brain the same way
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:22.100]   that I like to think, which, you know,
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:26.180]   can we solve this big problem, this big question?
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:28.820]   - And certainly you're making amazing strides
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:29.740]   in that direction.
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:33.420]   And I love your answer because it really brings together
[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:35.240]   the many features of the circuitries
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:36.940]   and the phenomenon we've been talking about today,
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:40.300]   which is that while it begins with sensation and perception,
[02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:41.880]   ultimately it's the context,
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:44.020]   and that context is highly individual
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:47.380]   to person, place, and time, and many, many other things.
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:50.740]   On behalf of myself,
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:52.740]   and certainly on behalf of all the listeners,
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:54.540]   I want to thank you, first of all,
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.180]   for the incredible work that you've been doing now
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:58.740]   for decades in vision, in taste,
[02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:01.220]   and in this bigger issue of how we perceive
[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:03.020]   and experience life.
[02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:05.540]   It's a truly pioneering and incredible work.
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:09.420]   And I feel quite lucky to have been on the sidelines
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:11.240]   seeing this over the years and hearing the talks
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:14.260]   and reading the countless beautiful papers,
[02:15:14.260 --> 02:15:17.240]   but also for your time today to come down here
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:19.300]   and talk to us about what drives you
[02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:21.100]   and the discoveries you've made.
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:22.740]   Thank you ever so much.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:24.420]   - It was great fun.
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:25.940]   Thank you for having me.
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:26.780]   - We'll do it again.
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:28.780]   - We shall.
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:29.880]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:31.820]   for my discussion about perception,
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:33.960]   and in particular, the perception of taste
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.820]   with Dr. Charles Zucker.

[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:04.120]   We do read all the comments.
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:06.440]   On today's episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:07.700]   we didn't talk about supplements,
[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:10.660]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:12.740]   we talk about supplements that are useful for sleep,
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:14.220]   for focus, for hormone support,
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.820]   and other aspects of mental health,
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:17.600]   physical health, and performance.
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:19.140]   If you're interested in some of those supplements,
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:21.820]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman
[02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:23.480]   to see the catalog of supplements
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:24.820]   that we've helped them formulate,
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:27.520]   and that map directly onto specific protocols
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.160]   described on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:31.920]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:34.440]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:38.320]   we are @hubermanlab on Twitter and @hubermanlab on Instagram.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.900]   And at both Twitter and Instagram,
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.140]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:44.680]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.960]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.940]   but much of which is distinct from the information
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:49.800]   contained in the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:52.760]   We also have a newsletter in which we spell out protocols
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:55.520]   and some summaries from previous podcast episodes.
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:56.620]   If you'd like to check those out,
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:16:59.300]   you can go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu,
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:01.500]   and you'll find the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:02.700]   You can sign up for that newsletter
[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:04.340]   simply by providing an email.
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:06.060]   It's completely zero cost.
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:07.580]   We have a very strict privacy policy.
[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:09.360]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:11.000]   Again, that's hubermanlab.com.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.540]   Go to the menu and look for the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:15.680]   And if you'd like examples of previous newsletters,
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:18.080]   you'll also find those at hubermanlab.com.
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:19.580]   Once again, thank you for joining me today
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.700]   in my discussion with Dr. Charles Zucker
[02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:23.200]   about the biology of perception
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:25.880]   and the biology of the perception of taste in particular.
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:27.360]   I hope you found that discussion
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:29.300]   to be as enriching as I did.
[02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:31.380]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:33.180]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:35.760]   [upbeat music]
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:38.340]   (upbeat music)
