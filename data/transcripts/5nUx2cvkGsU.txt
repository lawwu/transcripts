[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.240]   the Gospel according to St. John, in chapter 8, verse 12.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.880]   The twelfth verse in the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:27.240]   Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, "I am the light of the world; ye that followeth
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.640]   me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:43.840]   Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, "I am the light of the world; ye that followeth
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.360]   me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.520]   Now this is one of these great statements that we find scattered here and there in the
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.280]   New Testament scriptures, which are in and of themselves a kind of complete summary of
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.160]   the whole of the Christian Gospel, the message of the Christian faith.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.560]   It is interesting to notice how in the Gospels and again in the Epistles we ever and again
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.080]   come across one of these great phrases, great verses or statements which literally present
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.480]   us with the whole of the Gospel.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.520]   And I have no doubt that that is something which has been done quite deliberately.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.680]   We need, of course, to know the details.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.640]   We need to have this great truth worked out into its various component parts.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   But there is nothing that is more essential than that we should be aware of the whole,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.600]   this great central message of the scriptures.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.880]   Our danger, as I am never tired of pointing out, is that we miss the wood because of the
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.580]   trees.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.340]   And that is why it is right that from time to time we should come back and look together
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.740]   at one of these great, general, central statements.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.720]   That is always necessary.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.660]   But perhaps it is unusually necessary at this present time.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.680]   The world in which we live is a world that is characterized above everything else today
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.800]   by a sense and a spirit of confusion.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.160]   I think you will agree that in every realm this is the thing that is most obvious.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   Confusion.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.940]   Uncertainty.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.720]   And it is interesting to notice how this is something that presents a kind of contrast
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:02.760]   to what was once true, and a time which some who are present this evening are able to remember.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.840]   If you look at the realm of political activity, you will see this confusion.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.640]   There is no longer the clear alignment that there once was.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.280]   Each party seems to be fading into the other.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.080]   And the old divisions and landmarks, I say, are no longer evident.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.280]   There seems to be a confusion in the minds of people in their very thinking processes.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.160]   It seems to be the same in industry.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.400]   There is uncertainty.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.780]   Everybody is fearful of the future.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.880]   Everything seems to be in a state of flux.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.640]   We are in an age of transition.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.040]   And definitions and landmarks are no longer clear.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.880]   Unfortunately, when you come to the realm of morals, all this is still more evident.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.120]   Indeed, there are some people who do not seem to recognize even the category of morality.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.840]   I was saying this morning that there were things which once upon a time were taken for
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.240]   granted almost by everybody, which by today have become most uncertain.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.160]   What is moral?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   What is immoral?
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.560]   Is there such a thing as morality?
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.800]   Some people do not believe that there is a kind of amorality, non-morality, no recognition
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   even of the very standard.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.160]   What would be condemned a hundred years ago by everybody as sin has become the thing to
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   do.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.440]   And you are almost regarded as a back number, some kind of anachronism in society, if you
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   do not do it.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   Now, that is the position in the realm of morals.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.680]   There is a lack of definition, a lack of certainty, a lack of being able to recognize landmarks.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.760]   But, and it is to this I am adverting this evening, and more particularly, unfortunately
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.320]   when you come to the realm of religion and to the Christian Church, the same thing is
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   true.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.760]   And there is great confusion, obviously, as to what is Christianity, as to what it is
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   all about.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.000]   I say, therefore, that it is a good thing that we should spend our time together in
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.880]   considering a basic, comprehensive definition of what it all means and is, such as we have
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.680]   in this verse.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.800]   We are in the month of May, the month of the May meetings and conferences, when a great
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.380]   deal will be said in the name of Christianity.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.780]   But I make no apology for saying that it seems to me that the point at which we should all
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.680]   begin is to discover what is Christianity.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.720]   What is the use of talking about the Christian attitude to this, that, or the other, if we
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.440]   do not know what Christian means?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.880]   Or we come to consider application.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.680]   Well let us at any rate try to know what we mean when we talk about the thing itself.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.040]   What is Christianity?
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   What is it about?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.600]   Well, now, here I say we have got a great, resounding, marvelous statement concerning
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   it all.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.400]   Obviously, with a statement such as this, I cannot hope to deal with it exhaustively
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   this evening.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.000]   I am merely going to consider it with you in a general manner, hoping, God willing,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.240]   to go into it more in detail and into the obvious divisions that it itself suggests
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.480]   on subsequent Sunday evenings.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.040]   But it is important, I say, that we should take this general view.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.360]   Well now, let us look at it.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.960]   Look at this extraordinary effect which confronts us here.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.400]   Look at this picture.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.360]   Here stands a man who had been working as a carpenter.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.920]   He was not even a Pharisee.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.520]   He had not been to any of the schools.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.080]   He had not been trained as a religious leader, nor trained as a leader in any other sense.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.720]   A man who appeared to be just an ordinary artisan, a working man, a carpenter.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:10.480]   And yet he stands and looks into the faces of the leaders of the Jews' religion.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:20.400]   He looks at them and he says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   Now I say this is the most staggering and stupendous thing that has ever been uttered
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.300]   in this world.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.000]   There is nothing comparable to it anywhere.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.320]   Now this is Christianity.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.960]   It came as a great shock to these people to whom it was first uttered.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   And I have a feeling, an uncomfortable feeling, that if it only came to us as it should come,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.880]   it would come as a shock to many of us.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.920]   It would certainly come as a shock to many who call themselves Christian and who use
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:57.320]   the category Christian if they but realized the meaning and the significance of this.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.260]   They would be silenced.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.480]   They would be shocked.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480]   They would be amazed.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.840]   We are living in times, I say, when the situation is so desperate we can afford to take nothing
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.120]   for granted.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.400]   And that is why I am calling your attention to this basic matter this evening.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.880]   It's just one, of course, of many statements which our Lord made along the same line.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.960]   "I," he said, "am the bread of life."
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.400]   I am the door.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.080]   These are his statements.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.720]   But there's none of them, I say, that is greater than this one.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.040]   None more astonishing, amazing, even staggering.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.680]   Let's try and look at it.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.360]   It's such a great statement, I say, we could spend the rest of our lives in looking at
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   it.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   We shall do so.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.680]   And you know, when we get to eternity, we shall still be considering this.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.680]   We'll be looking at him, seeing him as he is, this light.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.480]   Well, now, then, what does he tell us?
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.760]   Well, the first thing is this.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.800]   Christianity, after all, is Christ, the person.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:16.640]   "I," he says, "I," he was always talking about himself.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.840]   Read your Gospels, you'll always find that.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.480]   You don't find Jesus Christ talking about the Christian attitude to this or that.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.040]   He's talking about himself, always.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.000]   "I, look at me," he seems to say.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.080]   He stands before people and says things about himself.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.360]   Now, there is surely the starting point.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.200]   And this is the thing above everything else that needs to be emphasized at this present
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   hour.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.480]   There are so many who seem to be thinking about the Christian faith and the Christian
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.720]   message in terms of a teaching or an attitude.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.800]   This is the phrase of the Christian attitude to this and that.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.520]   What does Christianity say?
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.240]   And you know, he himself is lost, he's not spoken about.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:05.560]   The blessed person, the most staggering thing of all, is not mentioned.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.080]   And Christianity is regarded as if it were but a philosophy or a political or a social
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   teaching.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:20.160]   To me, this is the supreme tragedy of the hour, that the person of the blessed Lord
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.760]   himself is being hidden and concealed.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.560]   In certain churches he's being concealed by the Virgin Mary and by the priesthood and
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   by ceremonies and various other things.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.280]   But the commonest form of concealment of all, it seems to me today, is that he's concealed
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.240]   in phrases, in attitudes, in ideas, in philosophies, in points of view.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.280]   And people have never come face to face with Christ himself.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:57.400]   And yet here, as everywhere else, as I'm indicating, he calls attention to himself,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.200]   the person, this person, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.880]   And my dear friend, unless you come face to face with him, the person himself, you know
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.520]   nothing about Christianity.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.200]   It's not a matter of attitudes and ideas, I say.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:21.680]   It is essentially being confronted by this blessed person and coming to know who he is
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.960]   and what he is and what he's about.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.760]   I, I, myself, he's talking about himself.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.560]   It is the person of the Lord that matters.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.040]   Oh, how tragic it has been throughout the centuries that this blessed person has been,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.680]   as I say, hidden, hidden behind morality.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.200]   People who think that as long as you live a good life, you're a Christian.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.800]   You don't need the Son of God to be moral.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.720]   The great deal of morality in the world without him altogether, it's always been.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.480]   He's been hidden by morality.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.180]   He's been hidden by religion.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.720]   Interested in your church or chapel, interested in your denomination, this is the big thing.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:12.080]   And the blessed person, not known, not spoken of, activities, work, good work, religious
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:22.600]   work, can stand between people and meeting this man there of Galilee, of Nazareth, who
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:31.080]   stood and said, "I am the light of the world."
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.240]   Have you considered this person, my friend?
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.160]   Is he always in the center?
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.920]   Is he always before you?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.160]   You realize that he matters even more than his own teaching.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.360]   He himself supremely.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.480]   He's the theme of this book, the Bible, Old Testament and New.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.080]   The whole of the Old points to him.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.640]   The whole of the New is describing him, looking back at him.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.520]   He, everywhere, the person.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.400]   There is this uniqueness about this message, that the person is more important than anything
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.560]   else.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.360]   And if we have missed the person, it will avail us nothing that we are aware of and
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:21.240]   believe in and subscribe to certain aspects of his teaching.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.800]   The second thing I emphasize, obviously, is this, that he not only talks about himself,
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.240]   but he makes a very exclusive claim for himself.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.080]   "I am the light of the world."
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.840]   And the authorities are agreed in saying here that the order of the words in the Greek,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.600]   in the original, is such as to put great emphasis upon this "I."
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:49.040]   What it really means is, "I and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.560]   That's what he said.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:14:00.480]   He said it in such a way as to say, "I and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:13.360]   Now I want to emphasize this, the exclusiveness of the Christian message, the sheer exclusiveness
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.960]   of the claim of the Lord Jesus Christ for himself as the light of the world.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.400]   Now I want to put this as plainly and as simply as I can, because to me it is of the very
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   essence of the whole thing.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   Either this is the only gospel or it's not a gospel at all.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.440]   But we are living in a world which doesn't like exclusive claims.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.840]   There is great objection taken to this today.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.600]   The great word of today is ecumenicity.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.200]   And we are all to come together and to agree this is valuable and so is that.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.360]   Christianity, all right, one amongst the great religions of the world.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:02.320]   No, no, "I and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.160]   What a staggering statement.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.080]   If this wasn't true I wouldn't be in this pulpit.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   What is to be a Christian?
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:16.120]   To be a Christian is to believe this, that there is nothing of any value anywhere about
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.480]   life, death, God, and eternity save this, save this person.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.920]   I and I alone am the light of the world.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   He means that there is no light apart from him.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.400]   That's what he's saying.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   I am the light.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   It's in me.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   It's nowhere else.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.760]   You walk in darkness if you don't walk after me.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.320]   He's exclusive.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.240]   He claims this uniqueness.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.800]   You realize what that means, don't you?
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.280]   Let's put it quite simply, quite plainly.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.680]   And you know, my friends, I'm putting this in as blunt a way as I can hoping that it'll
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.720]   offend somebody because if you've never been offended by this gospel you've never believed
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.520]   it.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.640]   The offense of the cross, the offense of Christ.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   You know what he's saying?
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.240]   He's standing here, this man who'd been working as a carpenter, who'd never been even
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.440]   trained as a Pharisee, he stands up and he says, "If you really want to know the truth,
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   listen to me.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.720]   Don't listen to the Greek philosophers."
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.960]   What a staggering statement.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:30.840]   There was that little country of Greece, famous for her learning of knowledge and understanding,
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.640]   and had produced that mighty succession of great philosophers and teachers.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:43.680]   Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and their various schools and subdivisions, and all the men
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.720]   who'd risen in the various schools and were lecturing in their parches.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   What were they doing?
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   Seeking after wisdom.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   What's that?
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.880]   Well, trying to understand life, trying to understand what it's all about, why the world
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.600]   is as it is, how a man should live, what is man, how can a man die, what lies beyond it.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.240]   That's what they were concerned about.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.880]   And they were trying to understand all this, trying to find some light in the darkness.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.200]   Here is one who gets up and says, "They didn't succeed.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.040]   There's no light there.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.440]   There's no light in Greek philosophy."
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.960]   My dear friend, I am here to repeat that and to assert it this evening.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   This is the essence of the Christian message.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:32.600]   The world and all its wisdom, philosophically speaking, has not discovered the truth.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:38.040]   It's in darkness about these great vital essential matters.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.720]   Well, the Apostle Paul has said it once, and for all I needn't keep you.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.080]   He puts it like this.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:52.300]   It was because and when the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:57.080]   of the thing preached, this gospel, to save such as believe.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.500]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.200]   In spite of all that mighty effort and endeavor, and I'm not derogating in any way from their
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.400]   greatness, but I am here to say this, they have not found a glimmer of light about these
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   ultimate matters.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.080]   They just didn't know.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.200]   But it's not only true of Greek philosophy.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   It's equally true of Roman law and Roman culture.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.560]   The ancient world was divided more or less, as you know, between the culture of the Greeks
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.120]   and the culture of the Romans.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.040]   The Roman approach to life was rather different from that of the Greeks.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.920]   They didn't go much into philosophy, but they were experts in this whole matter of
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.360]   government and law and order, and their idea was that this was the thing that was needed
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.520]   supremely.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.920]   They were great colonizers.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.520]   It was a great empire.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.440]   And they, of course, introduced many reforms.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.360]   They were great men at building roads, and it was quite a boon and a blessing, and they
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.320]   improved trade and everything like that.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.400]   Yes, they were very great people, those Romans, but you know, in these ultimate matters about
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.880]   life, death, God, eternity, they were complete ignoramuses.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.520]   They knew nothing.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.200]   Nothing at all.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.640]   They worshipped, as the Greeks did, their multiplicity of gods.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.000]   They did not discover the light, the truth.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.480]   All the boons and the blessings, great as they were, were finally of no value.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.440]   I mustn't keep you.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:25.960]   You can put in into the same category all the ancient law and learning of China.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.240]   You know, there were great things happening in China before Christ ever came into this
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   world.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   Let me give you one simple illustration.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.760]   You hear all this talk about penicillin today, don't you?
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.760]   Wonderful discovery.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.400]   This mold, you see, that kills germs and therefore cures so many of our diseases.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.640]   Did you know that the ancient Chinese, before Christ ever came into this world, used to
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.120]   cure distemper in dogs by using the same sort of mold?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.400]   They used to go to the stones.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.800]   You know how moss, a kind of something, gathers on the stones, that green, greenish-blue material
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   that gathers on stones?
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.880]   Well, it's this mold, and they used to scrape that off and give it to the dogs and found
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.040]   that it cured distemper before Christ ever came into the world.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.320]   There was a great civilization in China, very able people, again, great philosophy, great
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:23.160]   thinking, and this kind of scientific approach to many of the problems of life.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   It was very wonderful, and yet, you know, when you come to these great matters, they
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   had failed completely.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.400]   There's no light there.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.000]   I and I alone am the light of the world.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.920]   Egypt, wonderful things were done in Egypt.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.360]   There was a great civilization again in Egypt.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.180]   I'm told that modern builders and contractors still don't understand how those pyramids
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.180]   were put up.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.720]   It stands as a perpetual enigma and problem.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   But it was done.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   They'd got the knowledge.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   They'd got the ability.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   It was a great civilization.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.800]   It's gone, but it was great.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.840]   Yet, but you know, when you come to these vital matters, they knew nothing.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.720]   And this one can stand and say, "I and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:14.280]   Throw in the learning of India, ancient India, Persia, all these mighty civilizations and
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.680]   cultures that have come and have gone, read Professor Time beyond them.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:26.000]   All I'm here to say is that our Lord stood there in Jerusalem, and he said this, "I
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.800]   and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.400]   And my dear friend, it's as true tonight as it was nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.080]   Put in all your modern scientific knowledge.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.840]   Put in all your further advances in philosophy.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.480]   Put in all the culture of this country and every other country, and I say the claim stands
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.120]   and is as unique tonight as it was when he first started it.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.080]   He and he alone.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.680]   There is no light apart from him.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:02.040]   But secondly, he means this, that all the light is in him.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.200]   It's not only true to say that there had been no light before he came.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.680]   There is no light anywhere in addition to him.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   He needs no help.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.840]   He needs no supplement.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:22.560]   And that is why I protest this evening once more against all this talk, which says, "Ah,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.000]   yes, of course, we must have the Christian insight, but it's very interesting to hear
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.760]   what the Hindu's got to say, the Mohammedan, and what the Confucian has got to say.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.440]   Why do you claim this exclusiveness?
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.880]   Why not to recognize that there's value and that there's light and there's help in all
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   these things?
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.640]   Why not let all come together, therefore, to this great world congress of faiths?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.880]   Why stand and be so exclusive?"
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.680]   My dear friend, there's only one reason, and it's this.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.560]   There is no light whatsoever in any of the others.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.480]   And it's not needed, thank God.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.760]   What's the point of lighting your candles when the sun is shining in its full meridian
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.960]   in the heavens?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.760]   The light is there, and it's in him and in him alone.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.440]   It's exclusive in him.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.560]   He needs no help.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.400]   We don't want any help.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.240]   Christianity asks no help from any other religion.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.600]   It needs no supplement.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.760]   It is complete.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.000]   It is full.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   It is entire.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.240]   The light of the whole world.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.560]   Not a segment, not a section, not a part or a portion.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.600]   The whole cosmos, the whole universe.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   Here is the center.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.040]   Here is the one and only light.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.960]   That's what he was saying.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:39.640]   I and I alone am the light of the world.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.040]   Have you come face to face with that, my friend?
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.080]   This is Christianity.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.560]   This is essential Christianity.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.440]   He with nobody else.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.480]   No assistant, no supplement, no addition, no qualification.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.760]   It is all in him, and it is in him alone.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.560]   Now then, let's go on and follow him as he goes on.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   What does he say?
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:12.480]   Well, he puts it here by saying that he is the light of the world.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.000]   And this is where my difficulty as a little preacher comes in.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   You see what he means?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.160]   Well, it is such a comprehensive term.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.560]   He says he is the only hope.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.680]   As over against the despair of darkness.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.960]   You read in the Bible, don't you, about people waiting for the dawn to come?
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.880]   You can't see in the dark, you see.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880]   And you feel hopeless.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   You are longing for the dawn.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.000]   There is a little hope when the dawn comes, when we have light, we can see.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.760]   You are groping about in the darkness, and you don't know where, and you are utterly
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   hopeless.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.200]   Well, you know, the gospel is introduced like that, isn't it?
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.320]   It is very fond of quoting the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   He says, now this is what is happening.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:25:03.680]   The people that sat in darkness have seen a great light, hope, as over against the darkness
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.120]   and the gloom of despair.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:12.600]   But then, of course, the light also represents knowledge as over against ignorance.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.060]   Truth versus the lie.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.880]   And again, it means holiness as over against sin.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:28.120]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.960]   Our God is a consuming fire, the light of holiness.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.640]   Over and against, I say, the darkness of sin.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.160]   Well, clearly, no man can possibly deal with all this in one sermon.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   But therefore, I've got to pick out this evening, and I want to deal with one aspect only.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:53.880]   What he's saying is that he and he alone is the light in all those respects.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880]   What does it mean exactly?
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   What does it mean to us?
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.680]   Well, now, let's look at it like this this evening.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.880]   There's a division in my text.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   Did you notice it?
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.600]   There is a division as between the world and he.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.400]   Then speak Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.280]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.440]   I'm going to take that division.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.980]   The whole world needs light.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.360]   The individual needs light.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.960]   And that is, in a sense, the message of this book from beginning to end.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.100]   And it doesn't matter very much which of the two you start with.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.880]   You can, if you like, start with your personal problem and work from that to the whole problem
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.260]   of the world, the universe, or if you prefer it, you can start the other way around.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.560]   You can take the whole problem of the world, and then you can come and say, well, if that
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.960]   is so, what about me?
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.160]   Where do I come in?
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.280]   What is my relationship to all this?
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.520]   Well, all right, let's adopt that second procedure this evening, because it seems to be the way
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.760]   in which people are thinking at the present time.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.320]   Everybody's talking about the world situation, the whole position of humanity at this present
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   time.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:15.600]   And it's very right that we should be concerned about it, because the condition of the world
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.720]   is alarming, it's appalling.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   Here we are in this mid-twentieth century.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.320]   What exactly is happening?
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.360]   What's it mean?
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.480]   What's it all going to lead to?
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   What's the outlook for the human race?
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   What's the future of the world?
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.040]   And it's all right, I'm quite prepared to discuss these questions.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.440]   I assure you that before we finish discussing them, we'll be back with ourselves, because
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   after all, you know, you are saying I'm interested in the problem of the world, yes, but my dear
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.760]   friend, you're a part of it.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.520]   And if you don't think about yourself and as well as that world, well, you don't know
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   how to think straight.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.280]   However, I'll start with you.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.680]   We'll look at the great problem of the world.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.000]   And what our Lord is saying here is this.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.640]   There's literally no hope tonight with regard to this whole question of the world apart
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.760]   from what is found in him.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.560]   I am the light of the world.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.640]   There is no hope anywhere except in me this evening.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   That's what he's saying to us.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.680]   Now, what does he mean by this?
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:25.020]   Well again, I'm reminding you that he says there's no other hope.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.400]   And it is essential that we should be clear about that.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   Let's look at it like this.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.120]   Let me put it in the form of a question.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:42.660]   Can you point out any hope for the world as it is tonight apart from this gospel?
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.420]   That is precisely his claim.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.360]   He says there is no other hope.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.680]   Now, there is one advantage in preaching in 1960 rather than somewhere around about 1860
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.440]   and subsequently.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.960]   You remember how Charles Darwin published that famous book of his in 1859, Origin of
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.540]   Species.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.740]   It gave a great impetus to the so-called theory of evolution.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.200]   And it's been tremendously popular.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   What's it say?
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.380]   Well, what it says is this.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.720]   I'm looking at it from the world's standpoint this evening, not from the individual.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.160]   What it says about the world is that the world as a whole is advancing and progressing and
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:30.800]   developing, going upwards, and that it eventually will reach perfection.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.000]   It says that in the heart of the universe, in the heart of life, there is a vital power.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.920]   It doesn't know how it's got there, but it postulates it.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:45.720]   And it says that this vital power is slowly elevating the whole race and the whole world.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.680]   Do you really believe that still?
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:56.120]   Do you find any hope for the world's situation tonight in that thought?
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.680]   Do you, as you read your newspapers, come to the conclusion that the world is gradually
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:07.920]   evolving out of its troubles and difficulties in the direction of peace and perfection?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   People have believed this.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.140]   They have held on to it tenaciously.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.040]   They were so proud of it at the end of the Victorian era, so proud of it in the Edwardian
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   era.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.280]   But you know, I'm going to say a strange thing.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.460]   I'm going to say, "Thank God," in a sense, "for the war of 1914-1918."
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.560]   It really demolished that nonsense.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.800]   This twentieth century of ours has been one of the most appalling centuries the world
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   has ever known.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.240]   There's never been more mass slaughter and more unutterable folly.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.640]   Man has never appeared as such a fool as he is today.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.000]   No, you really can't any longer believe that the whole cosmos and the whole of humanity
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.720]   is evolving, and that we've only got to wait and be patient, and we'll be out of
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   all our troubles.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:31:00.640]   There's no hope there, is there?
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.160]   And then, you know, there were others who believed in legislation, and that acts of
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.000]   parliament were going to make a perfect world.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.640]   I'm old enough to remember this.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.880]   I knew people who really worshipped certain liberal politicians before the First World
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   War.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.800]   They were convinced, and they used to say it openly, that by acts of parliament you
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.360]   could legislate in the kingdom of God.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.880]   The social gospel, they called it then, and that's what they meant.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:34.120]   That by acts of parliament you could really introduce the kingdom of God, and they believed
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.960]   it was being done before the war.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   Legislation can do it.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.720]   Well, we've greatly added to that legislation since.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.440]   Would anybody like to say that we are solving the problem?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.040]   Are our acts of parliament dealing with the situation?
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.220]   Is the lot of men and of the whole race really being lifted up?
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.480]   Can we see a way out?
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.040]   Is it just a matter of waiting and passing a few more acts until we are right out in
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.920]   that wonderful upland with its sun shining upon us, as you hear it in the perorations
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   of the politicians?
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:17.000]   No, no, there's not a glimmer of light there.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.560]   Others have believed that education is going to do it, moral teaching.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.280]   Oh, people have pinned their faith to education.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.440]   Again, I'm old enough to remember this.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.920]   They really believed it, that if only we were sufficiently educated, all our problems would
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   be solved.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   They say, "Who are the men who fight?"
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   Well, they're ignorant men.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   Look at those ignorant men in the fairs.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.840]   There they are fighting one with one another.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840]   Why?
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   Well, because they're ignorant, because they've been drinking.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.240]   If you just teach people that it's foolish to get drunk and make them think they won't
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.120]   hit, they'll think first and they'll solve their problems.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.160]   And not only will individuals do this, all the nations will do it.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.960]   They say, "When man is truly educated, he'll give up such nonsense and they'll have great
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.400]   conferences and they'll all, in a spirit of sweet reasonableness, solve their problems."
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.760]   They believed it.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.720]   Is there anyone, I wonder, in this congregation who still is prepared to believe that by educating
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.920]   people you can solve the problems of this world?
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:17.160]   And then there are others who've pinned their faith into world organizations, League of
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:22.000]   Nations, United Nations, organizations, oh, talk about them, use your terms as much as
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   you like.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.320]   We've tried them all.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   Is there hope there?
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.080]   Do you pin your faith to the United Nations this evening or to any other organization?
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.360]   Are you pinning your faith to these world conferences, the statesmen coming together?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.840]   Are they really—the summit, at last, we are going to get there.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:45.640]   Do you really believe that?
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.440]   I and I alone am the light of the world.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.840]   There's no hope anywhere else.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.080]   There's no light.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.080]   There's no solution anywhere else.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.840]   Well, I needn't keep you.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.080]   You see, this is the position at the present time, that men and women rarely no longer
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.240]   believe in all that.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.720]   They're trying to say that they do, but they don't.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.400]   There is a pessimism abroad in the land.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:15.280]   You get it in people like Julian Huxley and Bertrand Russell and others.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.680]   What is this life of ours?
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:25.800]   Well, it's just a lot of bustling, a lot of noise and fury signifying nothing.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.400]   Well, there is the first thing that we have to notice, that our Lord is still saying that
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.080]   there is no other light.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.960]   There is no other hope for the world in general this evening, apart from him and what he has
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   got to say.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.160]   Well, now then, let me come to a second point.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.000]   If then he is the light, how is he the light?
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.360]   And alas, I've got to give a negative.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:57.880]   I must indicate to you how the Lord Jesus Christ is not the light.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.920]   And this is where there is so much confusion at the present time.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.880]   Is he the light in this sense, that you pick out certain of his teachings from the Sermon
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.640]   on the Mountain and elsewhere, and you say, "Now then, we've just got to practice this
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.880]   and we've got to persuade other people to do so."
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.480]   All we've got to do is to put certain of these slogans on banners and march and say, "This
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.640]   is the way."
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.280]   We've got to scrap our bombs, renounce war.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.960]   That's the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.680]   This is the Christian attitude, and that's going to solve it.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.760]   We've got to educate people to believe that this is the way.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.760]   Is that it?
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.160]   Well I'm here to suggest that it isn't it, and I'll tell you why.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:49.040]   That is not what he means by saying that he is the light of the world for this good reason.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.640]   That he himself is not present in that teaching.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.320]   It's only a teaching.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.480]   And the result is, you see, that you get in these marches people who call themselves Christians
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.520]   and people who say they're not Christians, but they believe this aspect of the teaching.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.000]   Christ himself is not there.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.240]   It's some attitude, it's some philosophy, it's some point of view.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.560]   But the person must be there.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.920]   I and I alone am the light of the world.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:23.840]   But still more important, all that you see still leaves it to us and to man.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.400]   According to that teaching, all we've got to do is to teach the people the principles
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.440]   of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.080]   We've got to tell them to turn the other cheek, and we've got to tell them to do this, that,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   and the other.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.480]   And then we've all got to be nice and loving, and as people will agree with us, at last
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.320]   we'll get rid of war and the world's going to be made perfect.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.360]   They really believe that, they're quite sincere.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.680]   I'm not suggesting they're not.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   They're quite genuine.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.680]   Of course they are.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.520]   And they really believe that my teaching, moral teaching and religious instruction,
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:57.400]   they can save humanity, save the world, by their teaching.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:02.160]   You see, it's rarely a denial of this gospel.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.400]   Even the teaching of Christ cannot save the world.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   It is not the light.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.840]   Or let me put another point of view to you.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.240]   There are certain people who are very fond of putting up this kind of slogan, "Christ
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.080]   or chaos."
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.200]   This is what our friends in America seem to me to be believing at the present time.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.760]   They say there's only one hope.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.000]   If we don't evangelize the nations, chaos will come.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.280]   And if we do, chaos will not come.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:38.560]   I suggest again that that is not the light which is given by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.920]   Evangelism is not an alternative to chaos.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:49.760]   The Bible teaches chaos and evangelism, not chaos or evangelism.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.560]   And then there are others who seem to me to be identifying the whole of the problem with
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:00.920]   just one thing, and that is communism.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:08.840]   There is no enemy, there is no problem, according to these friends, apart from communism.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.720]   And the one thing we've got to do is to solve this problem of communism and then all will
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720]   be well.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.200]   And again, they tell us that this can be done if we only adopt certain ideologies and certain
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.080]   teachings and put them into practice.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.280]   And they really believe that they can organize something that is going to save the world
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:30.360]   from this menace, the one menace of communism.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.840]   But you know, that isn't what I find in our text that we're looking at this evening.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   Listen.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   "I and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   Why?
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.960]   Well, because he is the Son of God.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:57.200]   He's not just a teacher, he's not just a religious genius, he's not just some great political
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:02.320]   leader thrown out, some great moral exemplar.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.520]   Look at his claim, look at the staggering character.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.240]   Realize what he is saying.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:14.120]   He and he alone is the light of the world for this one reason, that he is Son of God.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:19.680]   There's never been anybody like him before.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:27.960]   He has not come to seek for light, he is the light.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.760]   He is not a seeker after truth, he is the truth.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.240]   That's what he's saying.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:41.520]   In other words, he is calling attention to himself because of the uniqueness of his person
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   and of his character.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.920]   You see, he's putting it like this.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   "I," he's saying, "am unlike everybody who's ever been in this world before.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:01.040]   You have great teachers, you have great prophets, you have men who've sought diligently and
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.760]   tried to solve the problem.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   They can't.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   Why?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   Well, because they were men.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.840]   I am not a man.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   Look at me again.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   Listen to my claim.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.120]   I am Son of God.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.600]   This is Christianity that God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:21.160]   This unique event, the coming, the incarnation of the Son of God is entering from eternity
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   into time.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.320]   It all depends upon this person.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.960]   It isn't a teaching, it isn't an idea, there is an event."
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.080]   You notice how he goes on to put it in this very section.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:49.200]   "He has been sent by God into the world, and it is there that we see the only hope
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.320]   for the world this evening."
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.080]   I like to think of it like this.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.520]   Here is the predicament.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.800]   I look at men trying to solve it along their different lines, the lines I've been reminding
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.120]   you of, the philosophical and the political and the social and all the others.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.680]   All right, they're great men.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   They're sincere men.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   They're honest men.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.160]   But, you see, they've been trying ever since the dawn of civilization, and they're no
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.280]   nearer to it.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.320]   We seem to be getting further, in fact.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.000]   Men are trying, but men cannot.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Men have failed.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Is there any hope?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.400]   Yes, I say there is this blessed hope.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.200]   God is concerned about it all.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.000]   The God who made the world is concerned about the world.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.480]   He is looking down upon the world, and he has done something about it.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.000]   He has sent his only Son into the world.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.120]   That's why he is the light.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.720]   He has come down from God.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.760]   "You," he says, "are from beneath.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.760]   I am from above.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.080]   You are of this world.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.040]   I am not of this world."
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.960]   My dear friend, this is the hope.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.920]   And that is where in the uniqueness of Christianity lies.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.560]   Your Confucius, your Buddha, your Mohammed, and all your other religious leaders, they
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.000]   were only men, and they were men who were seeking.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.920]   But man is insufficient.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.200]   The problem is such that God alone can solve it.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.920]   And the message is that God has done something about it.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.000]   God so loved the world that he gave.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.360]   He sent his only begotten Son into it.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.040]   This one who could stand and say, "I am not from beneath.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.200]   I am from above.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.360]   I have descended, and I am still in heaven.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   I am not like you.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.840]   I am the light of the world."
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   Why?
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:39.720]   "Well, because God is light, and I am God the Son."
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.920]   And how does he give us this light?
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.160]   Well, he gives it, as you know, in his very teaching.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.120]   Doesn't he look at it here in this general aspect?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:59.400]   He says, "He that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness."
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.080]   That's how it should be translated, "the darkness," not "darkness."
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:10.240]   "He that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness."
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   What's it mean?
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:17.760]   Well, here is the answer.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:24.240]   The world is as it is because of the darkness.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.080]   What do you mean by the darkness, O someone?
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:35.920]   Oh, I mean this, that God made this world absolutely perfect.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.960]   Paradise?
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.160]   Why is it as it is?
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.640]   Where has the darkness come from?
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:56.320]   And the answer is, the devil, the prince of this world, who entered into the world and
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:03.400]   life and tempted men and caused them to rebel against God and to fall into sin.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   That's the explanation.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.160]   And until we grasp the explanation, we'll know nothing about the cure.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.560]   Christ, and he alone, gives us light on the darkness.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   Philosophy doesn't.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.360]   Nothing does.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:30.680]   But here is one who talks about the darkness and who tells us that God, the Father, has
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:37.360]   sent him into the world to deal with the problem of this darkness.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   How does he do it?
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:48.560]   Well, he came, I say, into the world in order to deal with it and in order to solve it.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.960]   He assumed human nature.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.280]   He fought the devil in single combat.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:04.080]   He has come into the world to destroy the works of the devil.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:13.480]   The devil has introduced the darkness and the evil and the sin.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:20.200]   And there, just before his death, he said, "Now is the judgment of this world.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:28.080]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.840]   That's why he is the light of the world.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:42.400]   He has come to destroy the devil and his power and his influence.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.520]   And he has done it.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.560]   What was he doing on the cross?
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:54.680]   Well, according to the apostle Paul, he was putting the principalities and powers to an
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:46:01.600]   open shame, triumphing over them in it.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.240]   "Now," he says, "is the judgment of this world.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.960]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.520]   And he did so on Calvary's cross.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.880]   He has vanquished the devil.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:23.840]   He has taken from him the power of death and the power of the grave.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.200]   In the resurrection he triumphs.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.400]   He is master.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   He ascends.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:36.480]   And there he says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.560]   Here is the light.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.080]   But then says someone, "Why is the world as it is?"
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.480]   And here is the answer.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.800]   He is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.560]   He is the Lord of history.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:04.360]   He is allowing the world to go on as it is for a given period of time.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.360]   He is in the meantime dealing with the individual, "He that followeth me," saving us out
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.140]   of this world and its doom.
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.520]   This world is a doomed world.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.800]   This world will never be reformed.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:27.880]   With all your acts of parliament, all your marching, all your international conferences,
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.560]   this world can never be saved.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:36.720]   There will be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.280]   Evil will persist.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.640]   Well, where is the light, says someone?
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.040]   Here it is.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.120]   That it is only for a time.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:54.320]   The Christ who came into the world and who said that he is the light of the world has
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.760]   conquered the devil.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.520]   He is a defeated foe.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.800]   He is within limits.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.960]   And this selfsame Christ will come back again into this world.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.560]   Will judge it in righteousness.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.760]   Will destroy the devil and all his cohorts.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.880]   Will purge the universe of sin and evil.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.720]   Will renovate the entire cosmos.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:29.880]   He will come again and there shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.760]   No, no, there is no hope in conferences.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   There is no hope in marching.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.840]   There is no hope in moral influence.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.840]   There is no hope in legislation.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.600]   There is no hope in all the affairs of men.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   But here is a hope.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   Here is life.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.840]   The universe is still God's.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.600]   God made it and God has not abandoned it.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.480]   The world is going to be changed.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.200]   It's going to be redeemed.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:04.360]   There is to be a regeneration of the whole cosmos.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.720]   And it is the activity of this Christ that does it.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.160]   He didn't come to tell us to be better.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.600]   We can't be better.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.320]   He didn't come to give us an example.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.280]   He came to do something for us.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.800]   And what He has done, I say He has done.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.560]   The world is as it is because of the darkness.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.160]   And He has come to dispel the darkness.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.920]   The light to lighten the Gentiles hath appeared.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.760]   The day star from on high hath arisen.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.240]   The light, the light of God has come into the world.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:40.680]   And the darkness shall be finally dissipated and dispelled.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:47.760]   And Jesus shall reign where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:50:01.640]   His kingdom stretch from shore to shore till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.200]   There is no other hope but there is hope in Him.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.800]   He is the Lord of history.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.560]   The world is His.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.880]   The Father has given Him the kingdom.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.520]   And He will finish the work.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   He came.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.960]   He did the preliminary work.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.120]   He is waiting until His enemies shall be made His footstool.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:26.080]   He will come again riding the clouds of heaven and destroy His every enemy, His every foe,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:32.440]   and set up His everlasting kingdom.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.440]   That's what He tells us.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:42.360]   That is His message about the world this evening.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:47.320]   He is the light of the world.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:52.840]   He is the only light.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.480]   Man cannot save the world.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.120]   Man cannot change it.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.440]   History is proving it.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.600]   The world tonight is proving it.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   Look at it.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.640]   There is no hope.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:11.120]   But here is the hope, the blessed hope, the coming again of the Son of God to finish the
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:24.560]   work and finally to hand the kingdom, perfect and entire, to His Holy Father.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:31.920]   That is the message with regard to the world in general.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.880]   What of you?
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.400]   Where do you come in in all this?
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.720]   Are you in that world?
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.120]   Are you in the dark?
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:50.040]   If you are and you die like that, you will suffer the fate of the darkness and of the
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.880]   fallen world.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.920]   But you notice that He indicates there is a way out.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:06.360]   He that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:13.040]   My dear friend, you can be rescued and redeemed out of this fallen, sinful, doomed world this
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.480]   evening.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.200]   You pin your faith to world reformation and you will go down in despair with the world
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.720]   and you will be lost, but you need not.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:27.000]   Though the world cannot be saved in that sense, you can.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.440]   You can be saved out of this present evil world.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:43.320]   The Christ who came to conquer Satan and to dispel the darkness came to save you.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.480]   He not only took human nature upon Himself, He took our sins upon Himself.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   He bore their punishment.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.920]   He died our death.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.280]   He has risen again for our justification.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.000]   He has gone into heaven to prepare a place for us.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.160]   That is the message.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.400]   The world cannot be bettered.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.320]   It is mastered by this darkness, the darkness of the devil and of hell.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.960]   And there is only one light that can set us free from it and show us the way to God.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.240]   He is the one.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.760]   He doesn't tell you to save yourself.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.660]   He tells you that He saves you.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.660]   It isn't His teaching.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   It is what He has done.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.440]   I and I alone am the light.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.640]   He has taken your nature, He has taken your sin, He has taken your punishment, He has
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.960]   been buried in your grave, He has risen, He is interceding for you.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:42.760]   He, the Christ Himself, not slogans, not philosophy, not teaching, not ideas.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:51.960]   I and I alone, the person, am the light of the world.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.800]   Are you following Him?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.440]   Are you walking in His light?
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:06.640]   Are you looking only unto Him and resting upon Him and His finished work?
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:20.280]   And are you looking for His blessed, His glorious appearing and the final glorious consummation?
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:25.040]   Thank God we are not left to ourselves.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.720]   We are not left to men, however great and noble and wonderful.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.720]   God is interested.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   God loves the world.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:36.760]   God has so loved it that He gave His only begotten Son.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:49.960]   But whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   Have you got it?
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:55:01.840]   Turn to the light, look to Him, and be ye saved.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.760]   Amen.
