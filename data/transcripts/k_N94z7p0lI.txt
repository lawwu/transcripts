[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.680]   All right, moving on.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.120]   We have a question here from Lisa.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   Lisa asks, "How can I take regular eye breaks for eye
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.640]   strain in a way that accommodates deep work?"
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.640]   Well, Lisa, I want you to do more productive meditation, make
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.960]   this a bigger part of your habit that is in almost any
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.120]   circumstance where thinking has to be done.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.400]   All right, I'm putting together this strategy memo, what is the
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.480]   outline I want to use?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   I've received an email from a client or my boss, and it's
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.360]   going to be pretty tricky.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.800]   Like, how do I answer this right?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.400]   I got to really think this through, like what I want to
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.480]   propose here.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.320]   I have computer code I need to write, but I really don't know,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.880]   you know, what type of object do I need here?
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.960]   What's the right algorithmic approach?
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.240]   Whatever it is, whenever you come across what should be if
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.360]   you're non-entry level on a regular basis, some contemplation
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320]   that has to be done, do that on foot away from a computer
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.760]   screen.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.800]   This is what I call productive meditation, working on a
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.000]   professional problem in your head while walking.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480]   This will be hard at first, but you'll get better at it with
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.440]   practice and bring a notebook with you.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   When we walk, take notes, walk, take notes.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.080]   You're away from a computer.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.120]   Notebooks do not cause eye strain.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.960]   And then you come back once you've thought it through and
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.400]   are essentially transcribing that thinking back into your
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.000]   computer world.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.200]   So if you do most of your non-trivial contemplation on
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.720]   foot, your head, walking and notebook, this will
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.080]   automatically induce a regular rhythm of breaks from your
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.960]   computer screen that really should handle the eye strain,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.120]   but also I think make you more effective at your work.
