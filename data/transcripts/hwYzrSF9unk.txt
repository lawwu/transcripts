[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   This video is of Andrew Huberman taking his first Jiu-Jitsu class with me at 10th Planet
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.440]   in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.560]   Gabe Tuttle, who you see explaining the techniques, is a head instructor there.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.320]   Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and a fascinating game of human chess.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.560]   Sometimes it is practiced with a gi, sometimes without the gi, like in this case.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.360]   It involves using detailed techniques to attain dominant positions that allow you to control
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.000]   your opponent's body and then to apply submissions like breaking their arm or choking them unconscious,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.440]   but stopping right before that as your opponent taps twice to designate that they give up.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.540]   This double tap, performed thousands of times in a Jiu-Jitsu journey, is the dismantling
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.160]   of the ego that I think is a very powerful tool for the development of the human mind,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.700]   scientific and otherwise.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.000]   Here Andrew learns how to take his opponents back with an arm drag and submit them with
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   a choke.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.080]   I wanted to capture this moment because hopefully it's inspiring to see a world-class scientist
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.120]   like Andrew take on something new and difficult with a beginner's mind.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.160]   Maybe this will inspire you to try Jiu-Jitsu as well.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.280]   I honestly have no idea what I'm doing, Lex.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   Zero.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280]   Fortune favors the bold, so good luck.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280]   So we're going to start off in the butterfly position.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.280]   First one we're going to be working is our dominant arm here.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   We're going to be working on the arm.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280]   We're going to hit our arm drag here.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.280]   Try to get across, attach your chest to that shoulder.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   Now you can move.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.280]   I can either come to him or pull him down into me.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   Watch this, he doesn't move real quick.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280]   I can hit my arm drag here.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   Look at his lap control.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   Here I want to actually mirror my hand.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   I just scoot out here and I'm keeping good tension with my elbow here as I pull Lex down.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280]   I'm not going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   I'm going to be able to do a lot of this.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.740]   That's perfect right there.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.020]   And swim that through.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.440]   Squeeze and expand your chest.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   That was perfect.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.600]   You're building this junk.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:41.240]   So rather than try and flip him on his back.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.580]   Yeah I'm going under the armpit now and reach for the far side of the neck.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.340]   Now from here, once I control the neck I can let the arm drag out.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.760]   That arm comes all the way around.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   I'm just pinching the back of his head with my elbows.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.200]   Just go straight, turn your elbow up.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.360]   Now you can kind of ratchet your grip in deeper.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   You feel that?
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.900]   So just turn that elbow back up.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.360]   This guy comes up and around this way.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   So there's a logic there.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   Basically you're trying to get into a place where you can use your own musculature.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   Rather than just battle.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   This arm and choke, or that blood choke also.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   So my forearm is cropped on the far side and I'm pushing your shoulder into the neck joint.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   I like it.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.840]   I can see how this would become addicting.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   Just because there's so many...
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   Especially if you're a very cerebral guy like you are.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.840]   This one's got a chute underneath it.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   You got it.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.840]   There we go.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   And then curl your left arm.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:49.600]   You just boa constrictor them.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Yeah boa constrictor.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.360]   I mean, when you get...
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   Maybe you know about this.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.120]   Actually I don't know what the visual...
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.560]   Why is there butterflies?
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   When you start to choke out?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.320]   Because your eyes are part of your brain and they demand so much blood and glucose all
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.120]   the time you're cutting off blood supply to the eye.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   Why the visual artifacts?
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.360]   Oh, why do you get the little...
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.080]   Just spontaneous transmission of neurons in the eye.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   Just...
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   It's cool.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.920]   When you see stars, like if you get hit hard and you see stars, it's because of your spontaneous
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920]   firing of cells.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.520]   Yeah, I get that with the choke.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520]   I just got that now.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.520]   Oh really?
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   There's the stars.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.280]   So it's this shoulder going in there.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.480]   That's the one blood.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.600]   My hand on the other side.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   Yeah you can feel the blood.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   You start to tunnel up.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Is that too fast?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   Did I cinch you in two places?
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   No, that was perfect.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   That was just really tight.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   Okay, sorry.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   Sorry.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   This is what I was saying, like, squaring with somebody who knows how to do it because
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   they can do it right.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   The butterflies are back.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   Shit.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   He's being kind.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   Lex Friedman is strong.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   I was worried I'd be going down the wrong road.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:03.520]   You're strong.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.920]   That Russian grip is insane.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.080]   So yeah, if you stand up, that's exactly the game, the other side of the game that we looked
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   at today.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.280]   So we looked at arm drags, but those only work when you're coming in.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.680]   If you're going away, I'm going to threaten you by coming up and then you're going to
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.120]   want to push me down, back down, and you'll be a little bit more nervous about me coming
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.800]   up so you're going to pressure yourself into me.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   I see.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   And that leads to the arm drag.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   Got it.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.640]   So like that's the yin and yang, the push and pull.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.960]   This is where the choke position is?
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.040]   Here and we're pressuring this way, yep.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.560]   That's called head and arm choke.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.600]   That's Rogan's favorite choke.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   So it's this, this.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.160]   Yeah, that feels very helpless.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.120]   Yeah, and I could just like sit here, relax for a while and just make it very unpleasant
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   for you.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   When you talk about relinquishing the ego, it's like yeah, you have to be willing to
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.240]   let somebody get real close to you, like mount you, flip you.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.840]   It's not something I'm used to on any basis.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.840]   It's really a beautiful sport.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   How do you feel?
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   First class in jiu jitsu.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   Love it.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   It's amazing.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.360]   I think I'm hooked.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.880]   I'm hooked.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:46.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
