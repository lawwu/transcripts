[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.960]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.220]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.440]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.320]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.780]   My guest today is Dr. Lane Norton.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.280]   Dr. Lane Norton did his training
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.840]   in biochemistry and nutritional sciences,
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.000]   and is one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   in exercise and nutrition.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.040]   He is also an expert in the topic of supplementation
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.560]   and other tools to augment health.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440]   Today, we discuss a large number
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.560]   of very important topics in these categories,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.760]   and we start the conversation
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.820]   by establishing what Dr. Norton's thresholds are
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.720]   for what he accepts as evidence,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.000]   in particular, actionable evidence.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.040]   So what follows is a description
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.120]   of what Dr. Norton really believes
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.540]   is worth paying attention to
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.600]   versus what he believes is worth ignoring
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.160]   in the realms of nutrition, training, and supplementation.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.040]   So you can be certain
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.120]   that as we start to go through the topics of sugar,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.200]   GLP-1 agonists, things like Ozempic,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.740]   artificial sweeteners,
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.240]   whether you should train to failure or not
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.940]   during your resistance training sessions,
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.440]   how much volume of training you need to do,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.840]   cardiovascular training and its different forms
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.680]   in terms of how they benefit healthspan
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800]   and lifespan and body composition,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.720]   protein and its different sources,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.040]   and on and on.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.680]   Indeed, we cover many topics in this episode.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.180]   You can be sure that all of the information
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.240]   you hear from Dr. Norton
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.800]   is being filtered through that extremely stringent filter
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.480]   that Dr. Norton is so well-known for.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.600]   And thus, by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.480]   you will be armed not only with the latest information
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.800]   on nutrition, training, and supplementation,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280]   but you'll also be armed with your own filter
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.760]   to determine what sorts of health protocols
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.440]   are actionable for you.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.520]   Before we begin,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.320]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.120]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.400]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.360]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.400]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.760]   to the general public.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.580]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.600]   Our first sponsor is Matina.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.880]   Matina makes loose leaf and ready-to-drink yerba mate.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   Yerba mate has long been my preferred source of caffeine,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.560]   not just because it tastes great
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.460]   and provides that stimulant effect that caffeine provides
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.960]   for focus and alertness,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.000]   but it's other many benefits that are unique to yerba mate,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.560]   such as regulating blood sugar, high antioxidant content,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.580]   and it can improve digestion.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.160]   And of course, I drink yerba mate
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.920]   because I simply love the taste.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680]   While there are a lot of different choices out there
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.500]   in terms of yerba mate drinks,
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.360]   my personal favorite is Matina yerba mate
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960]   because it's made with the highest quality
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.040]   organic ingredients,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.320]   and it has a very rich but clean taste.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.120]   And given Matina's great taste and commitment to quality,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.200]   I recently became a part owner in the company,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.980]   and I've helped design some of their drink products.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.020]   In particular, I love the taste of Matina's
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.560]   canned zero sugar cold brew yerba mate,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.160]   which has a slight taste of lemon,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.180]   and I personally helped develop that drink.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.340]   I drink two cans of Matina yerba mate cold brew
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.180]   in the morning,
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.100]   and I often drink a third can in the early afternoon.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.340]   If you'd like to try Matina,
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.780]   you can go to drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.180]   Right now, Matina is offering a free one pound bag
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.860]   of loose leaf yerba mate tea,
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.380]   and free shipping with the purchase of two cases
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.100]   of their cold brew yerba mate.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.380]   Again, that's drinkmatina.com/huberman
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.880]   to get a free bag of yerba mate loose leaf tea
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.900]   and free shipping.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.700]   You can also find Matina at all Sunlife locations
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.480]   and Erewhon locations.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.940]   So please be sure to look for it
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.220]   both at Sunlife and at Erewhon.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.260]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.100]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.560]   Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.000]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.060]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.460]   One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.980]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.380]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.420]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.880]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.580]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.640]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.500]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.480]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.980]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.740]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.900]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.220]   and end of the night.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.100]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.780]   for well over three years now,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.980]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.220]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.660]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.540]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.700]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.860]   and it also has snoring detection
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.140]   that remarkably will automatically lift your head
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.260]   a few degrees to improve your airflow
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.380]   and stop your snoring.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.380]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.380]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.540]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.500]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.800]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.380]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.100]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.260]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.820]   I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.500]   about the fact that most of us should be seeking
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.940]   to get about one gram of quality protein
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.500]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.420]   That protein provides critical building blocks
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.660]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.220]   but also promotes overall health
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.580]   given the importance of muscle as an organ.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.180]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.820]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.000]   One of the key things, however,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.420]   is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.580]   without ingesting excess calories.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.020]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.900]   protein to calorie ratio,
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.700]   such that getting that one gram of protein
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.860]   per pound of body weight is both easy
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.500]   and doesn't cause you to ingest
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.260]   an excess amount of calories.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.400]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.700]   They have venison steaks, ground venison,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.260]   and venison bone broth.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.320]   I personally like and eat all of those.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.700]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.980]   pretty much every day,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.780]   and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.100]   And if you're traveling a lot or simply on the go,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.880]   they have a very convenient Maui Nui Venison jerky,
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.480]   which has 10 grams of quality protein per stick
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.260]   at just 55 calories.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.180]   While Maui Nui offers the highest quality meat available,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.940]   their supplies are limited.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.620]   Responsible population management
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.700]   of the Axis deer on the Island of Maui
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.480]   means that they will not go beyond harvest capacity.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   Signing up for a membership is therefore the best way
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.380]   to ensure access to their high quality meat.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.200]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.460]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.380]   to get 20% off your membership or first order.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.240]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.660]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Lane Norton.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.940]   Dr. Lane Norton, welcome back.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.420]   - Thanks for having me back.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   - Before we jump in, I want to get your stance
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.860]   on what constitutes evidence.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.460]   Because I think a big reason why you are considered
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.220]   one of the, if not the most trusted person
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.860]   in the realm of nutrition and training
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.540]   is that you set a very high bar
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.020]   for what you consider science-based fact
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.540]   that motivates action.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.660]   So to just kind of break this down
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.540]   based on my read of the landscape online,
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.820]   it seems that there's a group of people,
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.060]   I don't know what to call them, purists or something,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.060]   who, unless there's a randomized controlled trial,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.940]   so that means in humans, or several,
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.740]   that points in a particular direction,
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.780]   they are very unlikely to adopt a new practice,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.540]   say, removing a given food or nutrient,
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.100]   adding a given food or nutrient,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.900]   training a certain way, not training a certain way.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.460]   Okay, that's one group.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.260]   Then there are the people who,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.900]   if they are told something could be a value,
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.380]   they hear it's worked very well for somebody,
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.680]   maybe they see some before and afters,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.060]   and it gets mapped to a mechanism
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.960]   that exists in humans and animals,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.460]   like, oh, there's this molecule,
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.020]   and if this molecule increases,
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.820]   X, Y, and Z happens, and training in this way
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.060]   or eating this way increases that molecule, for instance.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.100]   But no randomized controlled trial,
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.100]   then they're willing to try it or adopt it.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.020]   And then there's a third,
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.260]   probably a fourth category as well,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.740]   where people say they don't trust science anyway,
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.880]   science is flawed, or the controls required
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.220]   to design a really good experiment are so constrained
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.900]   that they don't mimic the real world well enough,
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.180]   and so they're really just interested in what works.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.340]   So they look to people that seem
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.480]   to have achieved the results they want.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.060]   Feel free to add another group,
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.340]   but which group would you consider yourself in personally?
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.020]   And then where does your evidence
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.900]   that you put out online and today come from?
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.860]   And I already know the answer to the last question,
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.820]   but I think it was important to kind of
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.100]   spell out the landscape.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.980]   - So everything you just mentioned
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.600]   would fall into the category of evidence.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.540]   Everything that we can observe is evidence.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.340]   But I think what people really struggle with
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.900]   is the idea of different levels of quality of evidence.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.320]   And if I had to put myself into a group,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.100]   I have definitely been on the side of,
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.480]   well, there's a case study in this journal,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.380]   and we're gonna try that now because it must work.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.980]   And, or my friend tried this and they said it worked,
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.260]   so I'm gonna try it.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.900]   And then I've also gone to the group of,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.860]   well, there's no human randomized control trial,
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.960]   so I don't believe it.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.980]   And I think now, I'm 42 now,
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.460]   and I've been doing this for two decades.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.260]   I think where I'd fall into is it really depends
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.940]   on how the individual is talking about the evidence.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.900]   Okay, so as you can probably imagine,
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.220]   I get sent a lot of stuff for people to like,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.860]   oh, debunk this.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.380]   And a lot of times people will send me things and I'll go,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.140]   hey, this person said this is their opinion.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.980]   That's fine.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.260]   Like I may disagree with their opinion,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.660]   but I'm not gonna like rake them over the coals
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.740]   for them saying this is an opinion,
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.860]   or this is my personal experience.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.700]   That's evidence.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.640]   It's low quality evidence, but it is evidence.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   I think I kind of fall in a line of,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.620]   I ideally wanna see human randomized control trials,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.780]   but there's also, as you mentioned,
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.620]   practical limitations with how things are implemented.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.260]   And I think one of the things
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.580]   that gave me a very unique perspective
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.740]   was the fact that I was doing my PhD in nutrition
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.540]   after I did a bachelor's in biochemistry.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.860]   So I had that mechanistic understanding.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.900]   And then I had an absolutely wonderful PhD advisor,
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.860]   Don Lehman, who just, shout out to him,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.220]   got a Lifetime Achievement Award
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.660]   by the American Society of Nutrition, 20 years too late.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.980]   But he was just incredible
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.700]   at being able to understand the small things,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.660]   but how they impacted the big things
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.220]   and what it looked like overall.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.420]   It's like a conductor looking at a symphony, right?
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.460]   And understanding how the trumpet sounds
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.220]   affects everything else,
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.140]   but then not getting so tied up in that
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.900]   that he can't hear all the music, right?
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.020]   And he was so good at that
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.900]   and was so good at getting me to think that way.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.380]   And so I think where people out in the landscape
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.540]   trying to dissimilate this really struggle
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.900]   is they don't really know,
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.540]   well, this person decided to study,
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.860]   and they equate that as evidence
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.500]   that's equal with any other evidence, right?
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.140]   And as a researcher, you know,
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.940]   not all evidence is created equal.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.220]   Not all journal articles are created equal.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.140]   And I mean, honestly,
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.660]   people who don't have the research background,
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.980]   it's hard to unpack this stuff.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.860]   So what I would say is
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.580]   you have to be very careful with people who cite studies.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.060]   And one of the things I'll say too is
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.060]   there's nothing more dangerous
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.060]   than somebody who's read a biochemistry book
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.100]   because they're gonna see pathway, biochemical pathway,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.340]   there must be an outcome.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.740]   So outcomes are what we really care about, right?
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.060]   At the end of the day, and when I say outcomes,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.500]   gaining muscle mass, losing fat mass,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.380]   risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin sensitivity,
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.260]   cancer, right?
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.380]   These are hard outcomes, right?
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.580]   And those outcomes are the summation of dozens,
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.460]   if not hundreds, if not thousands of biochemical pathways,
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.340]   all summing up to an outcome.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.940]   And just because something has a biochemical pathway
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.500]   doesn't mean it will create an outcome.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.860]   But if there's an outcome,
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.940]   there's absolutely a mechanism to explain it.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.420]   Now, let me give you an example
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.460]   of why this stuff can be so complicated
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.980]   and why it's so easy for people to,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.460]   if you wanna create a narrative,
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.940]   you can always find a study to create a narrative.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.740]   Aspirin, we would agree, is an anticoagulant.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.420]   There's a reason they give it to patients
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.780]   who are at risk for heart disease or a heart attack.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.580]   It's 'cause it reduces blood clots, reduces coagulation.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.100]   It also activates procoagulant pathways.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.180]   But the overall outcome is anticoagulation.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.420]   But if I wanted to create a narrative
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.860]   that aspirin was bad for blood clots,
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.700]   I could say, well, look at these biochemical pathways
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.380]   it activates.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.340]   And you see this, like, for example,
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.340]   I could create a narrative that smoking is not bad for you.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.100]   I remember reading a meta-analysis
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.900]   of the effect of smoking on the risk of adenocarcinoma.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.780]   And there's a forest plot with probably about 50 studies.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.540]   And most of those studies
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.060]   are to the very far right of the line,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.700]   which is increases risk.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.660]   And I think the overall effect
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.580]   was like three or 400% increased risk of adenocarcinoma.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.380]   But there were two studies
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.180]   that were to the left of the line, not by much.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.620]   And it wasn't statistically significant,
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.740]   but I could say, hey, look, I could cite these two studies,
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.380]   PMID, you know, they showed no increased risk
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.500]   of adenocarcinoma and actually might be slightly protective.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.700]   And by the way, did you know that smoking
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.380]   decreases the risk of Parkinson's by 30 to 40%.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.460]   And by the way, that's very consistent in literature.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.740]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.500]   - So I can start creating this narrative that smoking,
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.300]   but we know smoking's not good for you.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.140]   It's not good for you.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.700]   It raises the risk of lung cancer,
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.340]   all different kinds of cancers,
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.100]   cardiovascular disease, massive increase in risk, right?
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.100]   But I could thread the needle of science
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.180]   using these cherry-picked studies.
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.500]   And so what I'll tell people is if I go into a topic,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.420]   if I go into something,
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.580]   what I'm looking for highest quality of evidence
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.260]   is first off, do we have some meta-analyses on this topic?
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.500]   - Do you wanna just explain for the general listener
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.340]   what a meta-analysis is?
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.980]   Just in kind of top contour.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.820]   - Absolutely.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.020]   So a meta-analysis is basically
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.820]   where you're trying to compile studies
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.940]   that ask similar questions and look at
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.060]   what is the overall effect?
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   Do we have a consensus in the literature?
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.820]   And usually they're gonna show
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.020]   some kind of forest plot of all these studies.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.140]   And however far right or left of the center line
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.200]   is kind of giving you an idea of
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.500]   how powerful the effect was in that study.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.140]   And then you can see the confidence intervals
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.140]   in terms of how much variability there was.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.860]   And then you can see the thickness of the dot on there,
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.380]   which shows how much it contributed to the overall analysis
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.420]   by usually how many subjects were in it.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.340]   - Right, one study with 10 subjects
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.420]   would have a very small dot
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.580]   compared to a subject with 500 subjects.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.700]   - Exactly.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.940]   And so you're trying to,
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.020]   now you can do a bad meta-analysis
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.980]   based on inclusion criteria,
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.140]   and that's where it's important to look at.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.660]   But let me give you an example of a meta-analysis
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.060]   I cite pretty frequently.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.620]   The inclusion criteria is very important
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.540]   to make sure that you answer the question
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.460]   that you wanna answer.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.880]   And I say this when you're reading scientific studies.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.400]   I'm like, listen, just because there's a headline
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.460]   in even a paper, just 'cause the conclusion says something,
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.180]   that is the author's opinion, okay?
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.540]   You need to check to see,
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.500]   did they actually test what they're talking about?
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   And are the tests they use valid, right?
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.180]   So this meta-analysis was looking at lower carb diets
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.140]   versus higher carb diets or low fat diets.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.700]   And the inclusion criteria,
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.500]   this was done by Kevin Hall of the NIH back in 2017,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.340]   I wanna say.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.020]   And I thought he did a great job at the inclusion criteria,
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.700]   which was we're only gonna include controlled feeding trials
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.860]   where the food is provided to participants,
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.540]   because obviously we know the limitations
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.940]   of free living studies with nutrition.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.380]   - Right, self-report.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.120]   People sneak, people forget.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.620]   - We are going to make sure
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.820]   that these studies equated calories
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.940]   for the reasons we talk about.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.780]   You gotta compare apples to apples, right?
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.740]   So a lot of studies will come out saying fasting
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.060]   produced more fat loss, low carb produced,
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.460]   but then they didn't control calories,
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.460]   and it's very likely these people just ate less.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.300]   So they controlled calories and they controlled protein,
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   which is also important
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.640]   'cause protein changes the composition of weight loss.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.660]   Protein has a thermic effect.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.860]   Protein increases lean mass retention.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.680]   So that can change how much fat you lose.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.800]   And I think that it also had a requirement
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.080]   of like a minimum of four weeks, right?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.580]   And the outcome was looking at changes in fat mass,
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.220]   not fat oxidation, not energy expenditure.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.920]   It actually looked at the outcome that they cared about.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.300]   And they showed no difference, right?
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.540]   So I thought, well, that's a very well-done meta-analysis
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.180]   because the inclusion criteria make a lot of sense
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.660]   for the question that they wanna answer,
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.940]   which is not, is one diet easier to stick to?
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.300]   Not, is it more practical?
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.880]   The question was mechanically,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.280]   do these diets produce differences
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.640]   when we're comparing apples to apples in actual fat loss?
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.460]   And the answer was no, right?
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.900]   So, and then when you look at the other meta-analyses
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.780]   that have been done,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.580]   they tend to kind of support that, right?
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.100]   So the first thing I'm gonna look at is all right,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.780]   these meta-analyses tend to be looked at
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.880]   as kind of the highest form of evidence, right?
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.440]   Because you're compiling a bunch of different studies,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.180]   which, listen, we know there are bad studies that get done.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.500]   I think the amount of studies
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.140]   that get like just straight up faked
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.220]   is probably much lower than people think, but-
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.620]   - One hopes, but yeah, I would agree.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.220]   I think that people make errors.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.700]   I do think that a lot of quote unquote bad papers,
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.860]   or let's just say false conclusions,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.820]   arise from elimination of data
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.720]   that did not fit the person's desired outcome.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.620]   And the reason I say that
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.660]   is I think it's impossible to control for.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.460]   So you've got the student or postdoc doing the experiment,
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.940]   the results don't come out the way they would have preferred
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.500]   and then they're, let's just say I've observed before,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.180]   never in my laboratory, fortunately,
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.300]   but cases where people come up with reasons
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.240]   why that particular experiment wasn't valid
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.220]   because the mice were initially sick
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.900]   or the lot of drug that they used wasn't,
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.060]   it was heading towards expiration,
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.860]   they come up with reasons to exclude
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.060]   rather than outright data fabrication
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.780]   where people literally create results that aren't there.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.420]   And there are a number of different examples
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.180]   throughout history where people have done that,
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.620]   but I like to think that those are more rare.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.980]   - I think that's probably pretty small.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.980]   My experience is the same as you.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.280]   I didn't see much of that, or I never saw it observed.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.420]   - Usually end up reading about that
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.460]   in the form of retractions in journals that come out.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.580]   Nowadays, more close to the publications
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.200]   because of AI's ability to scan images
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.140]   and things of that sort.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.620]   - Yeah, I think, you know,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.240]   usually if I see a paper and the conclusion,
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.620]   like just straight up, I go, oh, I don't know about that.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.860]   When I go in and I read the methods
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.420]   and I read how they analyzed it
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.380]   and I read how they measured things,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.560]   99% of the time I walk away and go,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.740]   okay, I'm not surprised they found what they found, right?
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.180]   Because again, a lot of, and this does happen
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.580]   and it shouldn't, but a lot of studies are set up
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.340]   to kind of find what people want to find.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.380]   You can bias things in a certain way.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.840]   - Well, and what nobody talks about
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   or it's not discussed enough is that a lot of times
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.960]   the way the paper is written poses a question
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.400]   after the results are in.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   I mean, and this is a really a not correct way to do science.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.320]   I mean, in clinical trials, one has to wage a hypothesis,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.240]   excuse me, wager a hypothesis from the outset
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.680]   and then you go test that hypothesis.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.520]   You're not asking a question.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.600]   - And you have to say what you're gonna measure.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.640]   - Right, exactly.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.280]   Whereas in more typical laboratory science,
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.820]   people will design an experiment.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.280]   They have hypotheses, but then depending
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.320]   on how the experiments work out or don't work out,
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.200]   oftentimes they'll change the question
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.600]   to modify the hypotheses.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.920]   And one wouldn't, as a reader, as a journal,
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   as a reviewer, one will never know.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.800]   And so that's a slight of hand that is, I would say,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.040]   unfortunately is very common in bench science.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.080]   - But I will say like, there's very rarely
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.600]   where I say this was a bad study.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.280]   Often what I'll say is, I don't agree with their conclusion
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.620]   based on their data and their design,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.840]   but the data is the data, you know?
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.280]   I was just very fortunate, again, to my PhD advisor,
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.080]   I have so much gratitude, 'cause he just right away
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.960]   was like, "Hey, if we're wrong about something,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.160]   "that's fine," you know?
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.560]   And I'll give you an example of how results
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.960]   can seem to conflict, but how things are designed.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.440]   We actually wanted to test,
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.400]   does protein quality make a difference?
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.260]   And we wanted to look at it at like, not low,
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.160]   but like, just kind of like RDA levels of protein.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.940]   And we saw that protein quality did make a difference
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.180]   at those levels of protein.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.660]   But if you look at experiments where people are feeding
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.740]   like high levels of protein,
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.700]   like 1.6 to two grams per kilogram of body weight,
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.140]   you don't really see much difference in, you know,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.280]   lean mass or protein synthesis
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.940]   with looking at different protein sources.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.100]   Well, that's because it's much more regulatory on a low end
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.500]   because you're closer to those thresholds
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.280]   that trigger that signaling.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   And so, you know, we wanted to show at that level
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.640]   that it made a difference.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.580]   But then we also acknowledged, okay, at this level,
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.980]   it probably doesn't make as much of a difference.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.940]   But people can read those things and say,
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.280]   "Well, I don't believe studies 'cause they're conflicting."
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.700]   But no, when you read how it was designed,
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.580]   I can easily say, like I remember there was a,
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.560]   somebody sent me a study and said,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.180]   "Well, how does this fit with your data?"
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.860]   Which they were comparing rice versus whey protein
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.940]   and found that both stimulated protein synthesis
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.180]   to the same degree.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.380]   And I said, "Well, they used 40 grams of protein."
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.100]   Like if you get protein high enough,
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.420]   you can max out protein synthesis
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   regardless of the form of protein you're using.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.340]   And so that's just like one of those examples, right?
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.300]   So when I'm looking through this stuff,
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.680]   I'm looking at, okay,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.620]   it doesn't seem to be a consensus in the data.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.600]   And then is it like in these meta-analyses,
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.700]   does the inclusion criteria make sense?
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.460]   And then if there's no real agreement
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.500]   amongst the meta-analyses,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.940]   then I'm looking at, okay,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.780]   what do the most tightly controlled studies show?
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.220]   Like in the randomized control trials.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.420]   And then I'm kind of like basing opinion off that.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.860]   But you know the hierarchy of evidence, the pyramid,
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.140]   you got meta-analysis, systematic reviews,
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.020]   randomized control trials,
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.140]   you have cohort data,
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.660]   epidemiology and then animal studies
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.420]   tend to get kind of lumped in together.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.840]   And then you got like case studies
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.860]   and so on and so forth, right?
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.780]   And so all that stuff is valid.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.620]   It's all valid.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.700]   I think where I spend a lot of time on social media
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.540]   is for example, I'll give you a great example.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.700]   Someone saying, well,
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.820]   you don't wanna eat cruciferous vegetables
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.580]   because they have isocyanthanates in them,
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.580]   which can bind to iodine.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.400]   And that is going to impair your thyroid function,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.480]   lower your metabolic rate and cause you weight gain.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.960]   And so that's a pathway, that's a mechanism.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.400]   Is it possible?
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.640]   I suppose it is possible, right?
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.820]   That pathway does exist.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.020]   Iodine is important for thyroid function.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.020]   Isocyanthanates do bind to iodine.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.260]   You can take any food, even organic food,
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.420]   and you can find a compound in it
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.460]   that if you fed it in a high dose,
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.080]   it would have weird effects, right?
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.180]   And so the question is not, if you eat something,
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.220]   are there compounds in it
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.860]   that maybe activate negative biochemical pathways?
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.180]   The question is, what is the overall outcome?
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.100]   And so when these pathways are promoted
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.500]   versus let's see if we actually have
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.140]   randomized control trials in humans
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.340]   that measure what we actually care about.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.220]   And so we do have, like in that particular case,
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.820]   we have randomized control trials looking at,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.780]   okay, cruciferous vegetable intake and thyroid function,
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.860]   and there's no difference in the outcome.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.740]   And so what that says, and then no difference in BMR,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.080]   and then actually people who eat
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.060]   more cruciferous vegetables
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.540]   actually tend to be a little bit leaner,
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.180]   but that could be a little bit of healthy user bias,
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.340]   and they'd probably just eat less calories
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.420]   'cause they're more satiated.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.320]   But it's certainly not going the opposite direction, right?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.620]   And so the point is, again, if an outcome exists,
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.100]   there is absolutely a mechanism to explain it,
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.980]   but just because a mechanism exists
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.780]   does not mean you're gonna produce an outcome.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.060]   And I got exposed to this very early
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.820]   'cause I cut my teeth on the bodybuilding message boards
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.100]   back in the day where it was a bunch of nerds
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.300]   arguing with each other,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.140]   mostly who had no background arguing,
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.180]   but there were some actual sports scientists
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.960]   and professors who would get on those every once in a while.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.020]   This was before social media existed.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.740]   And I remember I was in biochemistry class, this is 2003,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.980]   and they're talking about
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.980]   how caffeine inhibits glycogen phosphorylase,
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.860]   which is a mechanism, and it exists.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.540]   Caffeine inhibits glycogen phosphorylase.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.460]   And so I made this post on the forums, and I said,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.480]   well, we should be having caffeine after a workout then
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.180]   'cause it'll help with glycogen resynthesis
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.500]   'cause it'll keep glycogen phosphorylase
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.220]   from breaking down glycogen.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.880]   And somebody came in and said,
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.140]   you're really like zooming in on a blade of grass
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.860]   instead of zooming out and looking at the forest, right?
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.900]   And biochemists, I was guilty of this,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.100]   and biochemists by trade, we get very focused on pathways.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.540]   But if you think about what caffeine does overall,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.800]   activates the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.000]   its function is to, like, you're liberating fuel.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.300]   Like you, and some people, when they take caffeine,
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   actually have a rise in blood glucose.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.260]   So that is, the outcome is actually counter
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.540]   to what that biochemical pathway is.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.820]   And so we've gotta be really careful
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.120]   with how we promote these biochemical pathways.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.860]   I mean, I did a really funny post on Twitter
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.020]   where myself and Joseph Sundell,
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.100]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with him,
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.020]   but he's a cancer biologist, great guy.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.360]   And we were joking back and forth.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.660]   I said, you know what, I bet I could, like,
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.380]   come up with a pathway to get people to eat poop.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.580]   Like, I can make a compelling argument for just eating poop.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.940]   And then he goes, I'll bet, he's like, I'll take that bet.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.300]   I'm like, okay, let's give it a shot.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.140]   So I'm like, what is some of the most common compounds
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.020]   in human fecal matter?
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.620]   And one of them is butyrate, right?
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.040]   Which is a short chain fatty acid produced by fermentation.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.020]   Butyrate, and so I did this post where I'm like,
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.300]   here's why you should eat poop to lose fat.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.020]   Butyrate increases fat oxidation.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.600]   I think it activates brown fat,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.860]   increases insulin sensitivity, decreases inflammation.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.720]   It's been shown to actually ameliorate
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.660]   the development of obesity in studies.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.340]   And so I had all these PubMed ideas.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.740]   Now, what I didn't tell people was,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.060]   those are all mostly in rodents, right?
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.340]   And it's giving an amount of butyrate
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.460]   that you'd need to eat about 50 to 100 pounds
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.900]   of fecal matter a day in order to get, right?
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.720]   - Sounding like a worse and worse idea by the moment.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.620]   - But that is very similar to a lot of the content
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.000]   that is out there, which is find isolated compound,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.740]   scare people or promote it to be the best thing ever,
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.280]   and then link it to an outcome.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.120]   And then sometimes you can tie in epidemiology
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.080]   with it as well to support whatever you want.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.840]   But again, like I'm not saying,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   I do things in my training and my nutrition
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.520]   that don't have randomized control trials to support, right?
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.680]   They don't really have anything to support.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.020]   It's just, it's how I've kind of fallen into doing things.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.720]   So that's okay.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.880]   But what I wouldn't do is come out and say,
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.320]   what I do is the best thing ever and here's why,
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.720]   especially if there was human randomized control trials
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.200]   to the counter, that is the biggest thing, right?
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.040]   If we have human randomized control trials
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.520]   and they're going the opposite direction
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.180]   of a case study or an observation,
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.680]   there's a reason human randomized control trials,
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.120]   I scream about them all the time,
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.440]   and why they're considered the gold standard of evidence.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.800]   When we look at cohort data, you're just observing people.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.640]   There's no intervention.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.080]   - Maybe explain what cohort data are.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.400]   Is it comparing two groups?
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.240]   - Sure.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.840]   So cohort data, you're comparing groups,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.320]   but you're not having an intervention.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.640]   So you're tracking them over the course of however,
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.880]   what period of time.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.700]   A lot of cohort studies,
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.400]   like looking at cardiovascular disease, cancer.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.080]   - These people decided to be vegan.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.320]   These people decided to be, let's just say omnivores.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.960]   - Those are some of the classic experiments, right?
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.300]   - And they weren't assigned to this experiment.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.500]   They agreed to join the experiment.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.680]   They'd been eating this way for a while.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.480]   You ask them a bunch of questions.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.560]   And you look at, okay, over 10 years, over 20 years,
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.760]   who gets whatever more often or less often, right?
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.960]   And then we try to figure out and back calculate,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.240]   okay, what's the effect and is this real?
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.600]   The problem is you have a lot of bias
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.000]   with those sorts of studies.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.340]   Meaning people don't do single habits.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.440]   They don't isolate habits.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.220]   I actually put up a reel the other day
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.820]   from my appearance on Stephen Bartlett's podcast,
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.320]   where he said, if I wanna fix my diet, I go to the gym.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.240]   'Cause a lot of people do that.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   If they're training in the gym,
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.880]   they don't wanna waste their effort
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.040]   by having a subpar diet.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.720]   Now in reality, eating a healthy diet is more important
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.680]   if you're not going to the gym, right?
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.460]   'Cause at least you're getting something.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.000]   But people do this habit coupling.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.800]   And so it's really hard to disentangle
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   those sorts of things.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.160]   Now, the reason that human randomized control trials
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.680]   are important is if you're designing an experiment
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.140]   and you randomize, what you are doing
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.840]   by randomly assigning people to groups,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   you're washing out that bias because you can assume
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.360]   that whatever inherent characteristics
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.440]   that might be coupled to whatever you're gonna try
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.800]   are gonna be randomly distributed
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.640]   and evenly distributed across the groups.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.680]   Therefore, we say human randomized control trials
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.960]   are kind of what's needed to establish causation
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.440]   because by randomizing, you can assume
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.560]   whatever differences are observed between the groups
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.920]   are due to your treatment
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   and not due to random chance or data artifacts.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   Now, randomized control trials, especially in nutrition,
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.000]   have very strong limitations,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.140]   which is you can't do a randomized control trial
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.600]   for 30 years.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.280]   You can't, I mean, I think the longest
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.960]   randomized control trial I heard about in nutrition
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.520]   is like two years long, right?
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.440]   And even then, it's not gonna be a very tightly controlled
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.560]   randomized control trial.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.480]   I mean, and if you're doing,
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.880]   if you're talking about like the tightest level of control,
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.320]   like a metabolic ward study,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.560]   four, six weeks, maybe,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.280]   'cause you're keeping people in food jail.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.800]   And I think where some of this confusion comes from
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.640]   is I think people think that there's just like this pool
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.520]   of people waiting around to be selected for experiments.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.400]   Like, yes, I'm ready, I've been waiting here.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.680]   No, there are people like you, like me,
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.480]   like just the average person walking down the street
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.000]   who saw a flyer and goes, okay, I'll volunteer for that.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.520]   And the more control you try to establish over their lives,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.920]   the less likely they are to do it.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.200]   And you probably gotta pay 'em, you know?
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.080]   I don't know anybody who would do a metabolic ward study
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.280]   without getting paid for it.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.080]   I mean, you're basically giving up four or six weeks
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.960]   of your life to go do that.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.760]   And so while I love human randomized control trials,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.400]   for some things, they're not always appropriate.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.200]   For example, if you're trying to look at heart disease
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.160]   and you wanna do a one-year human randomized control trial,
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.720]   looking at say, you know, saturated fat, LDL, cholesterol,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.920]   those sorts of things, well, how many people
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.120]   have heart attacks within one year after age 60?
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.560]   I mean, you're gonna look for really small differences
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.600]   between really small numbers, right?
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.400]   And the problem with that is you have no idea
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.520]   about their diet 40 years leading up to that.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.760]   And we know based on now the Mendelian randomization trials
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.280]   that the risk of LDL is more of like
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.120]   a lifetime exposure risk.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.080]   It's not just in this narrow sliver of time.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.280]   And so I love human randomized control trials,
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.700]   but it's also, I try to tell people,
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.240]   never turn your brain off.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.100]   Just because something gets published in a certain journal,
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.400]   just 'cause a certain researcher said something,
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.940]   just because it was a certain design,
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.600]   it doesn't make it infallible, okay?
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.640]   Science is perfect.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   Science is perfect.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.280]   Science is what is.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.640]   But it's done by humans and humans are fallible,
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.680]   imperfect people with their own personal beliefs and biases.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.280]   And that's why I look at consensus of data first,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.000]   because yeah, you could,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.080]   maybe some experiments got faked or maybe they had,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.520]   but when it's done over,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.320]   let's take something like creatine monohydrate, right?
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.640]   You have thousands of experiments
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.560]   done over decades of time in hundreds of different labs
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.200]   with many different funding sources
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.420]   in bunch of different countries
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.840]   under a bunch of different conditions, it works, right?
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.960]   Like if you go to consensus and you type in,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.480]   does creatine build muscle?
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.120]   It's like 92%, yes, which is crazy.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.940]   - Right, consuming five to 10 grams
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.480]   of creatine monohydrate per day
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.540]   is going to benefit strength and muscle mass
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.160]   and likely cognition to some extent.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.900]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.560]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.140]   By now, many of you have heard me say
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.920]   that if I could take just one supplement,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.000]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.520]   The reason for that is AG1 is the highest quality
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.440]   and most complete
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.160]   of the foundational nutritional supplements available.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.600]   What that means is that it contains
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.000]   not just vitamins and minerals,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.360]   but also probiotics, prebiotics, and adaptogens
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.800]   to cover any gaps you may have in your diet
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.080]   and provide support for a demanding life.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.920]   For me, even if I eat mostly whole foods
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.120]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.080]   which I do for most of my food intake,
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.040]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.760]   and vegetables, vitamins and minerals, micronutrients,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.960]   and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.400]   For that reason, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.040]   and often twice a day, once in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.080]   and again in the afternoon or evening.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.480]   When I do that, it clearly bolsters my energy,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.080]   my immune system, and my gut microbiome.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.240]   These are all critical to brain function, mood,
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.480]   physical performance, and much more.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.960]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.080]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.640]   to claim their special offer.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.800]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.640]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.280]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.800]   to claim that special offer.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.560]   - I realize I've been on a long diatribe.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.220]   - No, no, I wouldn't even call it a diatribe.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.000]   I think for those listening, this is pure gold
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.840]   because never before, certainly on this podcast
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.620]   or other podcasts, has anyone ever really spelled out
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.080]   how to discern differences in quality of evidence?
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.320]   - Right.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.400]   - It's mostly a free world, most places,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.280]   and people can do what they want,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.680]   but I think they need to decide
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.480]   what their thresholds are for quality.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.340]   - Yeah, and I think the one other thing I'll tell people is,
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.280]   I saw this the other day.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.440]   I saw somebody post, I think it was a comment
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.000]   on one of my posts, and I actually commented back.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.360]   They said, "I know I can trust you,
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.040]   "and whatever you say, I know I can take it to the bank."
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.000]   And I said, "I appreciate that,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.100]   "but I am a flawed human like anybody else.
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.200]   "Please don't turn your brain off."
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.920]   And one of the things I've really tried to do
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.400]   now in this stage of my career
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   is I wanna teach people how to think
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.040]   because if I just give you the information
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.080]   and I'm giving you a fish, great,
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.560]   but I'd rather you understand
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.880]   how I came to these conclusions,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.760]   you can see my logic and how it tracks,
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.200]   and then you can start applying it elsewhere.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.000]   One of the things I say to people is I'm like,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.200]   "If you want a quick and dirty hack
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.260]   "for knowing who to follow,
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.720]   "try not to listen so much
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.760]   "to exactly the information people say,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.840]   "but listen to how they say it, okay?"
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.960]   I was just telling you, I was on a podcast the other day
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.520]   where I said, "You know, here's this study.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.180]   "I might butcher the details, and if I get the math wrong,
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.760]   "if experts out there wanna comment and correct me,
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.200]   "please do that."
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.400]   Like, that is a way of talking about something
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.240]   where you're saying, "Hey, I could get this wrong,"
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.160]   or, "Hey, I might be uncertain."
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.840]   That's very different than saying, you know,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.040]   just hard, pure, you know,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.800]   real experts don't really talk like best,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   worst, always, never.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.000]   Like, they don't really use words like that.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.600]   And one of my favorite phrases that I tell people,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.320]   it's actually from an economist named Thomas Sowell.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.640]   He said, "There are no solutions.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.600]   "There are only trade-offs."
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.160]   And for example, you know, there's data out there
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.720]   that if you lower saturated fat,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.280]   it may lower your testosterone.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.520]   But there's also data out there
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.160]   that saturated fat raises LDL,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.280]   which is an independent risk factor
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.880]   for cardiovascular disease.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.960]   Okay, well, there's trade-offs there, right?
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.120]   Like, what do you value more?
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.280]   I would argue that probably the decline in testosterone
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.400]   isn't really physiologically meaningful for most people.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.080]   But again, there's not a good or bad.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.920]   There's trade-offs.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.280]   And I think when people get talking
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.360]   about biochemical pathways,
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.720]   one of the things I really try to hone in on
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.840]   is like, hey, there's not really good
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.360]   or bad biochemical pathways either.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.560]   Like, all these things exist for a reason.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.840]   Like, people, like, one of the things popular is like,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.120]   well, inflammation, inflammation.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.320]   I'm like, hey, you know, like,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.360]   inflammation does some things that we really need, too.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.480]   Like, you just don't want, like, no inflammation.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.000]   Like, it's actually an important physiological process,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.840]   right?
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.560]   Now, you don't want it to run away, for sure.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.000]   And so, again, I just give my PhD advisor
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.880]   a lot of credit of,
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.360]   he's like, know what you know,
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.720]   but always question everything,
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.640]   even the things we feel most fundamentally are true,
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.440]   'cause that is the job of a good scientist.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.600]   I'll give you one more story,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.440]   and then we'll move to another thing.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.360]   When I did my first experiment,
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.320]   well, actually, sorry.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.000]   No, this has been like my 15th experiment,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.720]   'cause my first 14 blew and didn't work.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.920]   - A typical graduate career.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.080]   And again, very patient man, very supportive.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.560]   I honestly cannot give him enough credit.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.960]   And if you look at the people that came out of that lab,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.080]   a lot of studs.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:04.400]   So, I did an experiment looking at whey protein,
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.680]   or sorry, complete meal with whey protein ingestion
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.360]   and how long the duration of muscle protein synthesis was.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.020]   Because most people kind of measured at 60 or 90 minutes,
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:15.360]   like the snapshot post-prandially for protein synthesis,
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.080]   looking for a peak, and we're like,
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.200]   "Is that really where the peak is?
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.040]   "We don't know.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.520]   "We're basing this off of purified solutions,
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.680]   "so let's do a duration experiment," right?
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.640]   And my hypothesis was,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.080]   well, however long leucine is elevated in the blood
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.880]   is gonna be how long protein synthesis stays up.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.800]   And when we got the data back on protein synthesis,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.560]   protein synthesis had come up, peaked at 90 minutes,
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.200]   and by three hours, it'd come back down to baseline.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.960]   And I went to run the plasma amino acids,
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.920]   and I'm like, "Okay, well, this is what we're gonna see."
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.640]   And that's not what we saw.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.240]   So, plasma amino acids, not only were still elevated,
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.900]   they were maxed out, or plateaued,
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.200]   at the highest level they would be at, three hours,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.120]   where protein synthesis was back to baseline.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.420]   And so, I said, "Okay, well, it's gotta be mTOR signaling.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.080]   "mTOR signaling's gotta be turning off,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.060]   "or something's happening."
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.920]   Nope, mTOR signaling was still elevated, right?
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.480]   And we saw this through phosphorylation
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.200]   of the binding protein 40BP1,
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.440]   which is a proxy for mTOR activation.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.540]   And then I said, "Okay, well, maybe leucine
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.760]   "isn't getting into the cell.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.880]   "Maybe that's why."
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   So, we looked at intracellular leucine,
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.680]   followed the exact path of plasma leucine.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.420]   And so, then I kept rerunning the plasma data,
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.520]   over and over, I probably ran it five times, right?
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.360]   And Lehman finally calls me into his office one day,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.180]   and he goes, "So, where do we stand
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.240]   "with this duration experiment?"
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.340]   And I said, "Yeah, it's almost done.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.420]   "I just, I gotta run the data again,
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.580]   "'cause the plasma data's gotta be wrong."
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.760]   And he, I saw his little eyebrow go up, you know?
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.340]   And he goes, "Why do you think that?
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.080]   "Let me see your data."
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.860]   He goes, "Your standard air bars are good.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.940]   "This looks to be relatively tight data.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.540]   "How's your technique?"
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.120]   And I'm going through how I, you know,
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.600]   all the steps to analyze plasmino acids.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.040]   It's not like CSI, by the way, everybody.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.080]   You don't just take a pipette,
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.160]   put something in a centrifuge,
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.240]   and all of a sudden you get back data.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.000]   There's many steps in here.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.520]   And so, I showed him all that, and he goes,
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.460]   "You know, it sounds like you are trying
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.580]   "to get the data to fit your conclusion,
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.000]   "and what you need to do is change your conclusion
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.840]   "to fit the data."
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   And that one line, again, it just opened my whole world
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.120]   up to one, if I'm wrong, okay, cool.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.880]   Like, I care more about getting the right answer
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.920]   than being right, and that's why we were talking earlier.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.680]   I'm like, there's so much stuff that I just don't believe.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.120]   I want to see 10, 20 studies before I go, "Yeah," you know.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.160]   And the other thing I'll tell people is,
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   "Hey, I don't plant my flag real strong very often,
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:58.260]   "so when you see me do it, I'm not saying I'm not fallible,
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.320]   "but if you see me do it, you probably should pay attention,
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.620]   "'cause I don't usually do that."
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.320]   - I love that description, but now my curiosity is piqued,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.360]   and you got to tell me.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.520]   So, if 90 minutes after ingesting protein,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.860]   protein synthesis peaks,
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.720]   and then it drops to baseline at three hours,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.920]   but leucine, one of the key amino acids in mTOR,
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   which is in the pathway of cellular growth
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.040]   and protein synthesis, are still elevated at three hours,
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.920]   what is the conclusion that explains the discrepancy?
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.840]   - Yeah, so, we actually looked for this for years.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.980]   So, a few things.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.840]   There was some other studies that supported that.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.000]   We called it a refractory response.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Actually, we didn't name it that.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.920]   There was another lab that named it that.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.400]   Basically, that protein synthesis was becoming refractory
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.240]   to the signal for protein synthesis.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.760]   So, just for real quick,
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.500]   I'm gonna try and explain this easily.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.740]   So, protein synthesis, you know,
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.760]   this sounds like probably a very abstract thing,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.480]   but it's how your body makes more protein,
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.280]   and whether it's in skeletal muscle,
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.940]   whether it's in the liver, whatever,
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.040]   you have your DNA, which is your genetic code, right?
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.120]   And then, that gets transcribed to an mRNA.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.400]   By the way, I'm leaving out a lot of steps here,
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.040]   but just bear with me.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.640]   That mRNA gets translated by a ribosome
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.720]   into a polypeptide chain or a protein.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.600]   So, a ribosome is basically attaching to the mRNA,
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.420]   and then, based on the mRNA sequence,
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.920]   is bringing in amino acids to match that sequence.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.400]   So, all the proteins in your body
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.900]   are coded for in your DNA, right?
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.700]   So, when it comes to this process,
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.200]   there's a complex called EIF4F,
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.000]   which acts as a scaffold for the ribosome
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.480]   to hook on to the mRNA.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.160]   And EIF4F, the formation of it,
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.460]   is basically rate-limited by the association
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.560]   of two proteins called EIF4E and EIF4G.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   And EIF4E is bound by a binding protein, 4ABP1.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.760]   And when you stimulate, when leucine stimulates mTOR,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.680]   mTOR stimulates the phosphorylation of 4ABP1,
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:05.040]   which makes it unavailable for binding with EIF4E.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.560]   It can bind to EIF4G.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.280]   That EIF4F complex can be made,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.560]   brings the ribosome onto the mRNA,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.880]   and now it can read, it can translate it.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   So, there's a little cellular biology lesson for you.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.640]   - Yeah, and if people didn't follow that,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.840]   don't worry about it.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.600]   What Lane's describing is that the presence
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.720]   of a bunch of molecules involved in protein synthesis
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.080]   is necessary but not sufficient for the protein synthesis.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:29.920]   - Right.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.800]   - Other things have to happen.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.640]   - Correct.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.560]   - And apparently, those other things are not happening
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.800]   after 120 minutes.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.920]   - So, another lab called it the muscle-full effect.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.800]   Basically, the idea is like once you've initiated
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.720]   that signal, it kind of runs and then it's done, right?
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   And just pounding more amino acids into the system
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.840]   is not going to further stimulate.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.880]   In fact, there was a study done back in,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.280]   I think it was 2001 by, I want to say by Rennie,
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.200]   another very well-known protein lab,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   and they infused essential amino acids for six hours
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.040]   and looked at skeletal muscle protein synthesis.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.680]   And they found it went up and then came back down
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.880]   by two hours and then never went back up, right?
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   - Good experiment.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   - Yeah, very interesting.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.240]   So, we looked at a bunch of different things.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.680]   The only thing we found that perhaps explained it
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.440]   a little bit, and I'm sure there's other labs
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.600]   that would argue with me on this,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.080]   and again, this is in rat skeletal muscle,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.360]   which by the way, is a good model
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.360]   for human protein metabolism, but still.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.520]   We looked at intracellular ATP levels
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.600]   and actually found that they were declining
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.120]   kind of in concert with the decline
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.200]   in muscle protein synthesis.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.480]   And muscle protein synthesis is an ATP-dependent process.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   But the process of protein turnover
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.920]   is energetically expensive.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.600]   It's one of the reasons that protein
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.080]   has a higher thermic effect of food.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.360]   And so our hypothesis was perhaps
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.960]   by the effect of protein stimulating protein synthesis
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:58.000]   to start this machinery is energetically expensive enough
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.440]   that eventually you kind of run out of steam.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.640]   And so you have the signal there,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.040]   but it just kind of ends, right?
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   Now, there have been other experiments,
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.240]   like Joran Trommelin just published a paper
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.200]   a few months ago that got a bunch of feedback.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.400]   It was 100 grams of protein
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.760]   after a resistance training exercise,
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.600]   and saw that it was basically,
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.800]   like a lot more of it was used
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.680]   than we thought would be used.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.640]   - Right, because for many decades,
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.560]   it has been purported, believed, and propagated
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.480]   that the maximum amount of protein
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.240]   that you can utilize after a meal is 30 grams.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.020]   It became like the holy number.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.800]   And this study essentially showed
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.960]   that more than 30 grams can be used,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.880]   not just as energy,
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.600]   but for the sake of protein synthesis in muscle, correct?
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.440]   - Yeah.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.040]   - And how did that study land with you,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.880]   given that it's one study?
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.960]   Without going into all the details,
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.800]   did that inspire you to change anything
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.880]   about your protein intake after training?
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.120]   - So, what I tell people is I don't make big shifts,
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.280]   in my opinions, based on single studies.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.360]   - Yeah, why does that not surprise me?
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.720]   - It shimmies me a little bit, right?
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.600]   So, and even before that study came out,
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.580]   what I had said is I think protein distribution matters,
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.100]   but I think it matters much, much less
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.560]   than total protein intake per day.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.640]   'Cause all we need to do is look at
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.300]   some of these resistance training studies
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.040]   with intermittent fasting,
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.240]   where people are eating all their protein
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.400]   in an eight-hour window.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.840]   And theoretically, you would think
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.800]   they would get less muscle growth,
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.440]   especially based on this refractory data,
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.940]   'cause less time to stimulate.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:37.800]   But at least in the studies out of Grant Tinsley's lab,
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.580]   I think there's two studies that were very well done
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.420]   where we don't see that.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.040]   Now, important to point out,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.000]   they trained during their feeding window,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.960]   and they had three,
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.480]   they made sure they ate three high-quality,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.820]   high-protein meals during that eight-hour time, right?
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.300]   So, at least in that context,
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.940]   there was no difference in the amount of lean mass gained
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.580]   between intermittent fasting groups
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.940]   versus continuous feeding groups.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.340]   - And in the continuous feeding groups,
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.060]   do you recall what duration
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.620]   they were eating their meals over?
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.100]   Was it probably 12 hours or so?
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.700]   - I don't recall specifically,
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.860]   but I don't recall an actual defined time.
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.680]   I'd have to go back and look at it.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.520]   - More than eight hours.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.580]   - For sure.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.820]   - I'm so glad we're landing here
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.780]   because my first,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.700]   let's just call it sort of operational
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.220]   or actionable question,
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.380]   which came from, you know,
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.420]   asking on social media for questions for you,
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.000]   was many, many people, if not in the thousands,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.420]   asked how to make sure that they're getting enough protein
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.740]   if they're doing something like intermittent fasting.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.840]   And I myself fall into this category.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.260]   I don't do it for any specific purpose.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.620]   This was long before Sachin Panda started doing his work
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.180]   on time-restricted feeding, AKA intermittent fasting,
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.940]   but I don't tend to want to eat any food
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.300]   until about 11 a.m.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.940]   Occasionally I wake up hungry, like this morning,
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.900]   and I had some eggs, I was particularly hungry,
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.080]   but I think that's representative of a lot of people.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.380]   I want hydration and caffeine in the morning.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.500]   I want to train in the morning,
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.180]   and then I want to eat pretty soon after I train.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.100]   But what that means is that I'm eating
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.340]   during an eight to nine hour feeding window.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.820]   And if I only manage two meals in there and a snack,
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.700]   and I can only assimilate, or excuse me,
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:23.020]   I can only put 30 grams of protein per meal
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.380]   toward protein synthesis.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.480]   We have to be careful not about using it for energy,
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.980]   but toward protein synthesis.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.860]   Does that mean that I'm not going to hit my target
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.380]   of one gram of protein per pound of desired lean body mass?
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.420]   'Cause I'm 100 kilograms, I weigh about 220 pounds.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.500]   I can easily eat 220 grams of protein
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.460]   in a nine hour period.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.620]   Like, give me three ribeyes, I'll eat all three.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:46.500]   I love ribeye steak, right?
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.540]   But the question is, can I use that?
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.140]   - So, and I'm going to bring this background
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.300]   to that particular experiment.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.220]   So over time, and when I left grad school,
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.620]   my position was that it matters.
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.920]   Protein distribution matters.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.020]   So I'll give you the straight down the line
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.140]   scientific answer, and then I'll give you,
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.360]   if you inject me with truth serum,
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.700]   what I really think answer.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.300]   And so we did an experiment, again, in rats.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.060]   We fed them completely same diets,
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.780]   same total calories, protein, carbs, fats.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.820]   But in one group, they got that pretty much evenly
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.200]   across three meals, and the other group,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.500]   70% of their protein was coming at their last meal.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.740]   And then the other two meals were like 15% protein,
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.940]   15% of their daily protein.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.660]   And 11 weeks, again, 11 weeks out of a rat's life,
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.720]   rodents live 18 to 24 months.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.020]   That's a big chunk of their life, right?
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.740]   And we did see about a five to 10% difference
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:47.380]   in the weights of the hind limbs in terms of muscle mass.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.900]   - In what direction?
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.320]   - Favoring equal distribution, right?
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:56.180]   Now again, hard to repeat that study in humans, right?
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.740]   And for the duration it's done.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:03.020]   So I came out saying, you know what?
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.180]   That's actually less than I thought we were going to,
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.020]   I thought we were going to find
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.300]   bigger differences than that.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.140]   You know, because, I mean, if you're thinking about
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.700]   number of times you're stimulating protein synthesis,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.300]   I mean, one per day versus three per day,
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.420]   I mean, shouldn't there be like
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.220]   a pretty significant difference there?
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.100]   And it was, I mean, it reached the level of significance,
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.640]   but again, I thought the effect size
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.980]   was smaller than I thought.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.300]   And so I kind of walked out saying, you know what?
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.320]   Total protein intake is the most important thing per day.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.720]   And then if you can distribute it relatively evenly,
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.140]   that's maybe the last five to 10%, right?
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.500]   And you've seen some human studies
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.700]   where it seems to matter, most seem to show
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.460]   it doesn't really matter that much.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.340]   Here's what I think.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.220]   If you're measuring an outcome like lean mass,
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.700]   that doesn't change much in eight weeks, unfortunately.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.100]   It's very small differences.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:54.700]   And so I think it's going to be hard to detect that,
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.840]   but what I'll tell people is,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.380]   if you're asking, can you build muscle
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.560]   in intermittent fasting?
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.440]   Absolutely.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.180]   Can you build a lot of muscle?
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.000]   Probably.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.760]   If you are a bodybuilder, specific population,
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.000]   or if your goal is to be the most muscular,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.440]   strongest human being you can possibly become,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.040]   I think you're probably better off
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.880]   not doing intermittent fasting
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.760]   just because those last, that last 5%
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.320]   may make a big difference.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.260]   And you're never going to be able to pick that out
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.600]   of a human randomized control trial in eight weeks.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.800]   At least I don't think you will.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.040]   And so, again, I don't have any human data
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.880]   to really back that up,
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.640]   but just based on what I know about signaling
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.300]   and the effects we saw on animals,
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.400]   that's kind of my recommendation.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.240]   But most people don't fall in that category.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   Most people are just worried about,
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.280]   hey, I want to look good, build a little bit of muscle.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.920]   Intermittent fasting is a perfectly fine tool for doing that.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.240]   I will say, you know, obviously we haven't studied
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.180]   some of the more extreme forms of fasting
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.540]   in terms of building muscle, right?
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.040]   Like the 16/8 has been studied,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.760]   but like I'm thinking of a study
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.720]   that was done without resistance training,
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.680]   alternate day fasting versus continuous
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.760]   kind of normal feeding.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.280]   - One day no eating, next day eat.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.520]   - Right, so they did- - Brutal.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.360]   - They did- - Or at least for somebody like me.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.440]   I can't think of anything worse.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.480]   I'd rather fast for three days in a row
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.180]   and then eat for, you know, four days in a row
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.720]   simply because I know that by day two,
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.680]   it's probably going to get easier, not harder,
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.280]   but on-off fasting eating has got to be just torturous.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.840]   - So the way they did it was they did,
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.680]   the continuous group was getting 75%
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.240]   of their maintenance calories per day, so in a deficit.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.160]   And then the alternate day group was doing 150%
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.280]   and then zero, right?
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.680]   So you're getting an average of 75.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.320]   And they actually saw differences in lean mass
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.160]   at the end of that study.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.740]   The continuous feeding group lost less lean mass
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.120]   than the alternate day fasting group.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.680]   So that's only one study
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.880]   and it didn't have resistance training.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.400]   It's possible that a resistance training
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.200]   could attenuate some of that stuff.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.400]   But what I'll say is, you know,
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.080]   the more extreme forms of fasting
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.960]   probably aren't optimal for lean mass, right?
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.160]   - Also, can you imagine training
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.160]   on a day of complete fasting?
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.540]   After three hours after that, you're going to be dying.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.380]   And then you can say, well,
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.700]   you could just train on the days when you eat,
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:10.600]   but then if you ever train legs hard, which I know you do,
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.320]   or if anyone does, and then the next day,
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.800]   you're not going to eat anything.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.320]   The day after training legs properly,
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.240]   my appetite's increased.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.480]   - Yeah, so I think this is where the rubber
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.040]   kind of meets the road in terms of straight down the line,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.800]   the randomized control trials say this,
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.840]   but I still do something a little bit different, right?
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.880]   Because the randomized control trials say,
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.040]   eh, protein distribution doesn't really seem to matter,
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.320]   right?
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.200]   But again, you inject me a true serum,
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   I think it probably does matter a little bit, right?
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.320]   Now, does it matter as much as total protein?
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.600]   Absolutely not.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.680]   That is by far the biggest lever.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.820]   But again, if my context is I want to become
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.800]   the most muscular, strongest human being I can be,
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.080]   which I do, 'cause that's where I compete,
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.760]   I'm going to distribute my protein
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.840]   probably over four to five meals per day, right?
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.920]   And so for you, just personally,
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.280]   what time of day do you wake up
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.800]   and when's your first meal?
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.080]   - So, well, it's summer right now,
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.040]   so kids are off of school.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.560]   So we're usually getting up around like 7.30,
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.880]   eight o'clock in the morning.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.440]   And my first meal is usually within an hour.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.760]   And then I usually eat within an hour of going to bed,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.640]   and then I'll have two or three meals in between those.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.680]   So usually I have about four meals a day.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.040]   Sometimes I'll have five, if it's just a longer day
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.760]   or just how my timing kind of goes
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.600]   or whatever.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.800]   - And does each one of your meals include
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.320]   approximately 30 plus grams of quality protein,
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.680]   some starchy carbohydrate, fibrous carbohydrate,
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.640]   and some fat?
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.080]   - I mean, sometimes they end up being like
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.320]   mostly protein or whatnot, but for the most part,
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.580]   there's a mix in each one.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.480]   And usually around 50 grams of protein at a meal.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.560]   About 235 grams of protein a day.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.960]   Some people would argue that,
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.120]   oh, that's more than you need.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.720]   The researchers shown that 1.6 grams per kg
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.240]   maxes out the response.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.760]   Here's the thing.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.440]   And again, this is where like scientific experiments
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.880]   are big blunt instruments, okay?
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.720]   They will tell you what not to do more often
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.800]   than they will tell you what to do, okay?
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:14.560]   When it comes to protein, my personal opinion,
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.840]   and this is just, I guess, a little bit of intuition
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.800]   based off of 20 years of studying this stuff,
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.200]   is that I don't know if there's an actual amount of protein
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.960]   that maxes out the protein synthesis response.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.360]   I would bet, if I was a betting man,
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.040]   that it's kind of an asymptote.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.000]   You're familiar with?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.960]   So, you're--
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.020]   - Not everyone's watching.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:38.640]   I just drew an asymptote, an asymptote plot.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.240]   But for those not watching, just think about
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:44.160]   a plot quickly rising very, very high
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.800]   and then essentially stays stable at the high level.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.360]   - Yeah.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.800]   - Maybe with a slight bit of taper.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.080]   - Yeah, so it's easier to explain
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.300]   if it's going towards zero.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.760]   So, an asymptote might be, okay, you start out,
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.440]   you have 10, then five, then two and a half.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.840]   - Okay, so you're running in the opposite direction.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.680]   - Right.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.600]   - Still asymptote going from high to low.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.420]   - Right.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.260]   - So, asymptote can go from low to high,
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.100]   it can go from high to low.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:04.920]   - Correct.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.480]   So, I'm trying to explain it 'cause it makes more sense
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.700]   when people kind of go this way.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.400]   You never reach zero,
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.040]   but it keeps getting incrementally closer.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.360]   On the other end, I don't think protein synthesis
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.280]   ever maxes out.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.360]   I just think the increment of increase becomes so small
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.880]   that practically there's no difference
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:22.080]   and you wouldn't see a difference in outcome, right?
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.840]   And so, I think that there's debate over,
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.440]   is it 1.6 grams per kg, 2.4 grams per kg?
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.320]   And there's even been a meta regression
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.220]   that showed up to 3.3 grams per kg had benefits.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.400]   I think a lot of this is with protein synthesis,
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.280]   you're looking for small differences between small numbers.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.240]   It's not a very sensitive analysis
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.480]   to be quite honest with you.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:52.140]   And again, we would never be able to pick out
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:52.980]   those differences.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:54.520]   And I'm thinking about, there was a study by Stu Phillips,
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.880]   if people don't know who Stu Phillips is,
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.560]   he's the best researcher going
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.200]   in protein metabolism right now.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:04.860]   But one of the best, so I don't wanna take anybody off.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.200]   And he did a study probably 15 years ago
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:12.040]   where they gave people different levels of egg protein.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.960]   And they looked at five, 10, 20 and 40 grams of egg protein.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.000]   And their conclusion was that 20 grams of egg protein
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   maximize the protein synthesis response.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.600]   But that's because straight down the line,
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.140]   if there's a p-value of more than 0.05,
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.120]   you can't say there's a difference, right?
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.760]   But if you looked at the absolute difference
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.040]   between 20 and 40 grams, I think it was like 11%.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.120]   And if you look at the graph,
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.960]   it almost looks like the start of an asymptote, right?
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.220]   Now this was one study, wasn't a huge subject number,
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.940]   but that's kind of where my personal thoughts land on it,
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.640]   that there's, that kind of also support this,
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.600]   okay, 100 grams in a meal, you know,
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.120]   could still be utilized,
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.020]   is I'm not sure if there's a max out.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.800]   I think there's a practical max out
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.360]   where you get to a point where,
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.940]   hey, you're like slamming down 50 grams more protein
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:05.120]   for 0.0001% more protein synthesis, it doesn't make sense.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.960]   But yeah, we'll never be able to,
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.800]   I doubt we'll be able to pick those numbers out
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.280]   in actual scientific experiments.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.960]   And the other thing to keep in mind
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.020]   with this whole protein metabolism picture
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.020]   is we're really only talking about
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.840]   one side of this equation.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.100]   So net gain or loss of skeletal muscle mass
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.440]   is the balance between protein synthesis
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.420]   and protein degradation.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:30.700]   And most of us protein researchers
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.660]   just kind of stick our fingers in our ears
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.460]   and go la, la, la, la when it comes to protein degradation
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.300]   because it's so incredibly hard to measure.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.860]   And so, yeah, like when we start
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.900]   to put all that stuff together,
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.860]   it's like now this picture gets really complicated.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:47.860]   So what I tell people when it comes to that kind of stuff is
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:53.340]   listen, you could really get into the weeds on this stuff.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.300]   The big rocks are about a gram per pound of body weight.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.220]   If you want to really, for all intents and purposes,
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.420]   max out the anabolic response, you're going to be fine.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.900]   - One gram per pound of body weight,
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.580]   which is what Dr. Gabrielle Lyon
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.300]   also essentially recommended.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.020]   - Right, I'm probably like, you know,
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.460]   real sticklers might be like,
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.360]   no, it's actually more like 0.7 or 0.8.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.980]   And then it's, well, it's actually based on lean mass,
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.820]   which I agree with.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820]   But just for all intents and purposes,
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.500]   you could say, you know, your body weight,
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.860]   ideal body weight, whatever it is,
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.620]   that number is going to be very sufficient
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.820]   for maxing out muscle building for the majority of people.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.940]   - And we should probably point out
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.700]   not just for muscle building, unless you disagree,
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.100]   and feel free to, of course,
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.740]   not that I need to tell you that.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.140]   Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, when she was here,
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.860]   made a really key point,
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.820]   which is that ingesting sufficient quality protein each day
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.980]   isn't just about building muscle,
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.580]   even for folks that don't want to build muscle,
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.820]   and perhaps even particularly for women
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.900]   who assume that, you know,
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.100]   building muscle can be a runaway process
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.740]   that maybe they're going to build too much muscle.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.940]   That's a false assumption, of course,
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.900]   that ingesting one gram of protein per pound of body weight
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.020]   or ideal body weight is going to be beneficial
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.460]   because it's going to improve muscle quality,
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.620]   one's own muscle quality,
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.900]   the health of the muscular tissue.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.740]   And then she did an excellent job
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.940]   of relating the health of muscular tissue,
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.580]   skeletal muscle, that is,
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.780]   to overall health and longevity.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.940]   So I just raise that because I know
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.380]   that many people listening to this
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.100]   probably want to add a little bit of muscle here or there.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.300]   Some perhaps want to keep the muscle
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.580]   they've gotten loose fat.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.660]   And some, of course, want to add a lot of muscle.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.260]   But it sounds like the recommendation is always the same.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.900]   Since we need to eat sooner or later,
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.420]   one gram of quality protein per pound of lean body mass
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.060]   or current body weight or desired body weight,
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.860]   that's going to be a good starting place.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.700]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:51.580]   And I think I would tend to agree with her.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.880]   You know, the process, because when you eat protein,
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.460]   you're not just going to start laying down slabs
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.080]   of lean tissue just from eating protein.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.100]   There has to be a stimulus, which is resistance training.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.700]   Or some people would argue you could stretch really hard
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.580]   and get the same thing,
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.460]   which there may be some evidence of that.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.700]   - With weights and lift them in between stretches.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.940]   No, I'm just kidding, which is basically weight lifting.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.020]   - There actually are studies now
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.660]   where they like put people in like really kind of
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.700]   hardcore stretching for several minutes
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.240]   and they actually see hypertrophy with it.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.080]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.260]   We could talk about those if you wanted.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.960]   But the point is either way, it's mechanical tension, right?
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.060]   So that's the stimulus, to build muscle,
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.340]   to lay down lean tissue.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.500]   But the process of remodeling is probably beneficial
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.820]   for multiple reasons.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.380]   So when you eat protein, like we said,
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.740]   synthesis goes up, degradation goes up, right?
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.040]   Because you're stimulating that process.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.700]   You're stimulating protein turnover.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.300]   One, that's relatively energetically expensive,
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.140]   all things being equal.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.220]   So that's where the thermic effect of protein comes from.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.080]   'Cause people say, well, it's the urea cycle
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:53.920]   and this and that.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.500]   Most of those ATPs you get back
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.700]   in different phases of that cycle.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.860]   Really, in my opinion, the thermic effect of protein
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.720]   is due to like kind of activation of this futile cycle
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.740]   of you're building more protein,
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.700]   but then you're also breaking down more protein.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.740]   And so part of that is you are remodeling.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.800]   You are making sure that that protein is higher quality
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.620]   in that tissue by continuously breaking it down
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.380]   and building it back up.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.120]   And so I would probably agree with that.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.620]   And then it's, again,
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.600]   even if you're at a resistance training program
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.160]   where you're not really building much more muscle anymore,
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.820]   the process of remodeling is probably good for you.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.260]   And I would just say,
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.200]   try to ally some of these concerns
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.060]   from people who are concerned about getting too much muscle.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.620]   So I have been lifting really hard
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.220]   consistently for 25 years.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.280]   I am very comfortable with saying I train harder
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.860]   than almost anybody else you can possibly imagine.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.180]   And anybody who has trained around me will back that up,
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.540]   back me up in the comments.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.980]   I train very hard.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:04.920]   And in a shirt, I look like an athletic guy who lifts.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.500]   I don't look like a monster, you know?
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.740]   Like you might see pictures of me
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.860]   when I was a bodybuilding show and like very, very lean,
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.780]   and that looks, you know, over the top.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.220]   But for the most part, I just look kind of athletic.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.620]   And I've spent my entire adult life
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.260]   trying to get too big, right?
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.220]   So for most people,
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.180]   unless you're on performance enhancing drugs,
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.660]   or you just have incredible genetics,
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.300]   that's not gonna happen.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.300]   And if it starts to happen,
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.360]   just back off on your lifting, easy fix.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.220]   So yeah, I think most people's concern with that
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.980]   is a little bit misplaced.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.720]   And the other thing I'll tell people is like,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.320]   hey, some of these like fitness,
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.180]   like especially like for women,
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.580]   a lot of these fitness models you follow,
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.420]   they show you certain workouts they do,
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.840]   they built that physique by lifting weights, right?
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.840]   And you're thinking that's a toned feature.
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.580]   Well, that person is actually pretty muscular, right?
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.980]   And so again, especially for women, there are exceptions.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.100]   Some people, some women have very great genetics
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.380]   for building muscle.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.380]   They usually wind up in track and field,
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.340]   that sort of thing.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:21.960]   But it's very hard to get too muscular for a woman.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.220]   And what I'll say is like, you know,
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.460]   typically muscle looks good,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.300]   and fat is what makes you kind of look bulky, you know?
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.500]   So again, I don't want to paint with too broad of a brush,
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.980]   but I would say that you don't really have too much
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:38.700]   to worry about when it comes to getting too muscular.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.780]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.100]   to thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.500]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.660]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.860]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.540]   and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.700]   Now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.660]   about the critical importance of hydration
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.820]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.560]   Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.460]   can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.820]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.540]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.100]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.460]   are critical for the functioning
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.700]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.660]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.120]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.740]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.180]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.100]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.300]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.880]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.600]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.780]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.740]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.880]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.080]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.820]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.660]   spelled drinkelement.com/huberman,
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.380]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.660]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.780]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.780]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.420]   Since we're sort of in this realm of protein,
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.140]   maybe we build out from there,
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.680]   'cause a lot of questions related
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.920]   to something akin to the following.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.700]   So, okay, so somebody strives to get one gram
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.380]   of quality protein per pound of body weight per day.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:11.400]   And I realized that whether somebody follows
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.200]   a pseudo-intermittent fasting thing
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.640]   where their first meal does around 11,
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.680]   and they finish up eating around 8 p.m.,
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.760]   or a more traditional eating schedule
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.720]   really is just the addition of one more meal,
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.880]   like in the morning.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.220]   It's like whether or not you eat breakfast.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.620]   And of course, some people shift it the other way.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.260]   They start with breakfast and they don't eat dinner.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.020]   But I would argue that in order to,
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.860]   if you have kids or a social life of any kind,
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.300]   most people can deal with sitting across the table
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.700]   with someone just having a cup of coffee for breakfast,
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.420]   but it's sort of awkward.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.700]   You limit yourself a lot in life
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.780]   if you can't eat dinner with other people.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.820]   I don't know, at least-
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.900]   - And that's, again, where the rubber meets the road
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.660]   with what is practically doable,
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.660]   'cause there've been some of these
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.660]   like circadian rhythm studies that suggest,
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.620]   well, maybe early time-restricted feeding
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.940]   is better than late time-restricted feeding.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.460]   The more high-quality, more rigorously controlled,
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.020]   randomized controlled trials are coming out now
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:05.540]   seems to show that it doesn't really make a big difference.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.660]   And some of the, again,
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.120]   the measurements you use matter, right?
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.500]   So there was actually a very recent study
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.860]   where they looked at 12 weeks.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:15.260]   They provided all the food to participants,
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.620]   equal in protein, calories, the whole deal.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.260]   The only difference was one group
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.620]   was eating 80% of their calories
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:25.380]   before 1 p.m. and they had a eight-hour
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.820]   feeding window in total.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.380]   The other group had a 12-hour feeding window
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.620]   and were eating over 50% of their calories
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.580]   after 5 p.m., I wanna say.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:38.660]   And so really, based on some of the chrononutrition stuff
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.560]   we've seen from some of the lesser well-controlled trials,
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.140]   they were expecting to see differences
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.980]   in glucose metabolism and whatnot,
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.820]   and they just didn't really see a difference in anything.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.260]   And I think the only thing they saw
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.860]   a little bit of a difference was in fasting blood glucose.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.380]   And here's what I tell people.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.300]   When you see a difference in fasting blood glucose
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:02.700]   but not HbA1c, you're looking at a transient difference.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:06.680]   And what I mean by that is HbA1c is such a great measurement
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.340]   because it's an area on hemoglobin
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.620]   that can be glycosylated.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.300]   And so that is very dependent on
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.540]   what is your overall concentration of glucose in the blood
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.340]   over a 24-hour period of time?
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.220]   Because it's exposed the entire time
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.100]   it's in your bloodstream.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.420]   So whether you're getting glucose spikes at meals
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.900]   or you have higher fasting blood glucose,
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.940]   it's gonna be very reflective
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.220]   of the overall 24-hour area under the curve, right?
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:36.660]   So why do some of these studies see a little bit better
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.580]   improvement in lowering fasting blood glucose
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.760]   whereas HbA1c doesn't show up?
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.240]   Well, think about it.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.700]   If somebody is early time-restricted feeding
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.460]   and they finish most of their food intake before 1 p.m.,
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.020]   they have an extra six, seven, eight hours
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.140]   that they're not hardly eating anything.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.540]   It doesn't surprise me that the next morning,
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.260]   because they've technically fasted for longer,
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.300]   you have a lower blood glucose.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.900]   Now, I can't really back this up straight up
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.360]   'cause nobody's ever measured it,
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.380]   but that, I think, is a logical explanation
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.420]   while you see some of this stuff.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.020]   And that's why I tell people
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.620]   the measurement you take really matters.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.100]   I think fasting blood glucose is a useful measurement,
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.300]   but I put much more value on something like HOMA-IR,
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.220]   euglycemic clamp, or HbA1c.
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:23.980]   So anyways, I think the early versus late time-restricted
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.220]   is, kind of doesn't matter too much.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.380]   - Great, you answered a future question right there.
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:30.540]   - See, I've--
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.940]   - You're telepathic.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.780]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.820]   - Uh-huh, that's what you didn't know about 'em.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:40.060]   So the scenario here is whether or not meals
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.180]   are distributed evenly through the awake day
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.100]   or stacked a little bit more toward the morning
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.580]   or stacked a little bit more toward the evening,
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.480]   if somebody gets that one gram of quality protein
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.420]   per pound of body weight,
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.780]   then they need to make up the rest of their calories
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.900]   with other stuff.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.820]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.180]   - And we have, broadly speaking, starches,
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.820]   fibrous, you know, fruits and vegetables,
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.980]   starches, and of course, fats.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:06.820]   - Right.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.020]   - And weight gain and weight loss,
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.500]   I think we both would agree is, or weight maintenance,
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.220]   is going to largely be dictated at this point
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.500]   by whether or not you consume more calories
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.600]   than you burn or not.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.700]   So assuming somebody's getting that one gram
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:23.980]   of quality protein per pound of body weight,
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.140]   is there any data that support,
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.120]   or do you believe, just by your own experience,
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.660]   that there's some value in stacking
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.860]   the starchy carbohydrates toward the earlier part
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.740]   of the day versus the later part of the day?
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.060]   And this has been an ongoing debate.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:44.000]   Like I, for instance, like a nearly pure protein and fat meal
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.740]   for the first meal, plus maybe a salad,
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.900]   some fibrous carbohydrates.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.700]   And then as they get towards evening,
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.660]   I like more starches and I actually taper off the protein.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.140]   I find, personally, that matches what I need to do
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.980]   with my brain.
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.340]   I'm more alert when I'm drinking caffeine
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.500]   and hydrating on a backdrop
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.420]   of slightly lowered carbohydrates.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.080]   But then as I get towards evening,
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.580]   taper off the caffeine, of course, for me,
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.700]   'cause I want to sleep well,
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.220]   start ingesting some more starches.
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.020]   It's not starch heavy, but I sleep like a baby.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.420]   But everyone would tell me, and does tell me,
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.140]   eating starches late in the day is going to make me fat.
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.300]   Eating starches late in the day
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.700]   is going to do all sorts of terrible things.
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.140]   I find the exact opposite for me.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.900]   So is there any real evidence
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.740]   that where one places their starches
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:27.780]   throughout the day matters?
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.100]   And let's just forget resistance training for the moment,
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.180]   because there is this post-training window
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.900]   where if I train first thing in the morning,
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.420]   I will eat starches at that time.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.660]   But let's just remove resistance training for the moment.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.220]   - So again, we're about rubber meets the road
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:45.760]   in practicality versus what hard line research says.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.460]   So I am not real convinced at all
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.900]   that it really matters when you eat your carbohydrates.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.460]   - Thank you, thank you, my goodness.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.900]   I knew I brought you here today for a reason.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.460]   No, I brought you here for many reasons, but-
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.780]   - Is that my bias has been validated?
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.540]   I can leave now.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.300]   So I really try to get people focused
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.980]   on the stuff that matters the most, right?
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.740]   So this is, if we're worried about carbohydrate timing,
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.040]   even if there are differences,
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.900]   we are zoomed way in on the blade of grass, right?
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.980]   We're not zooming out all the way.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:19.740]   And I think, hey, if somebody likes
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.260]   to eat more carbohydrate in the morning
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.680]   and that fits their lifestyle,
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.860]   and that is easy for them to continue to do,
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.980]   then I would say do that.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.260]   - And could I add, in terms of not focusing
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.100]   on a blade of grass,
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.840]   but something that I consider a major lever,
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.340]   if eating fewer carbohydrates in the afternoon
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.660]   and evening doesn't impede your sleep, then you're okay.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.140]   But I would argue if anything is interfering
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.820]   with your sleep on a consistent basis,
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.420]   you've got a serious problem.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:49.220]   - Yeah, so there are no solutions, only trade-offs, right?
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.460]   And when it comes to carbohydrate intake,
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.180]   you'll hear people say, the data's all over the place,
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.400]   okay, in terms of like timing and how people feel.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.260]   Some people say, well, I feel sleepy after I have carbs.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.540]   Some people have, I feel great after I have carbs.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.800]   Like I'm ready to go lift.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.660]   I have a big carb meal before I go lift, you know.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:08.080]   It seems to be all over the map.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.520]   Now, here's the thing what I'll tell people,
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.000]   because people ask me how I eat.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.040]   People have wanted me to do a full day of eating video,
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.440]   and I've kind of put it off for a while,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.640]   'cause I'm like, so much of the stuff I do,
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.840]   I'm not gonna give you guys a citation for, you know,
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.240]   and I know you're gonna want it.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.560]   And some of the stuff I do,
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.640]   'cause I just like doing it that way, right?
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.360]   Like I grew up in the era of bodybuilding magazines
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.100]   where they said you gotta have a big carbohydrate intake
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.420]   and a big meal before you go train
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.100]   and a big meal after you train.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.540]   So guess what I did?
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.540]   I got in the habit of eating like that,
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.140]   and it still sticks to this day.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.660]   I don't try to tell people it's better doing it that way.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.640]   Plenty of people have told me,
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.740]   hey, I don't feel good with a lot of my stomach
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:49.860]   when I go train.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   Or if I have a carb heavy meal in the morning, I feel tired.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:56.500]   The data doesn't really support that in terms of like,
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.100]   you know, on an average response.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.400]   But if you know that you feel that way,
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.240]   then by all means avoid, right?
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.800]   Like there's plenty, I remember one time I,
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.880]   so I used to go to a massage therapist in Tampa
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.840]   who would do cupping,
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.640]   and there's really no data to back up
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.880]   the efficacy of cupping.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.720]   - Is that right?
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.280]   - Yeah, not much, but she did it.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.520]   I liked the way it felt.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.800]   And I'm like, okay, whatever.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.600]   So I posted a picture of me flexing one time, you know,
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.480]   and there's the cup marks all over,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.200]   and everybody's like going crazy.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.220]   Like, how could you do this?
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.040]   I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a second.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.600]   I never said this does this,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.200]   and I never made any claims about it.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.120]   She does it, and I like the way it feels.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.480]   I'm not saying it does anything.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.000]   Actually, one of the things about being a scientist
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.600]   is like now I'm impossible to placebo,
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.660]   which is really annoying,
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.160]   'cause I would love to be able to placebo myself
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.000]   a little bit more.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.240]   - 'Cause placebo effect is powerful.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.360]   - It's powerful, and it's one of the,
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.920]   I was telling you earlier before we started filming,
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.800]   I'm like, it's one of the reasons
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.600]   I just don't believe a lot of stuff,
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.440]   because I know how powerful the power of belief is.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.240]   I mean, you had Sean Mackey on here.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.380]   Your beliefs about pain change your pain,
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.280]   like actually change how much pain you get.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.660]   It changes your pain experience.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.740]   So, one of the things I've become big on recently is,
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.780]   hey, what happens in the mind affects the body,
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:11.000]   and what happens in the body affects the mind.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.820]   So, just because I don't have a randomized control trial
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.180]   to support something,
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.580]   if we know the RCTs don't say it's worse, right,
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.740]   then you do whatever you like, right?
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.500]   And I think a lot of people get bent out of shape
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.420]   when I say, well, you know,
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.300]   when they control the variables that need to be controlled,
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.860]   there's no difference between intermittent fasting
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:30.960]   or just regular old calorie restriction,
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.700]   or there's no difference between low-fat diets
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.840]   and high-fat diets.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.180]   What people hear is, low-carb sucks.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.300]   Intermittent fasting sucks.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.860]   He said they don't work.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.180]   No, no, no.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.100]   This is great.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.500]   This is great news for everybody.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.580]   It means you have all the tools at your disposal,
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.340]   and you get to pick the one
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.540]   that fits in your lifestyle best,
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.340]   because that is what makes the difference,
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:55.700]   is what your overall lifestyle looks like,
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:59.860]   and we have way too many people worrying about the minutiae
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.060]   who just don't even exercise on a consistent basis,
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.900]   or they don't sleep well on a consistent basis,
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.260]   or they don't manage their psychological stress well,
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.540]   or they try to be perfect with their nutrition,
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.860]   then they fall off the deep end,
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.620]   and what I'm saying is, no, be imperfect,
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.820]   but be consistent with what you do, right?
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.280]   And so, for you, obviously carbs at night
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.620]   have not made you fat.
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:21.580]   Like, I have eyeballs,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.300]   so we can just dispel that myth right now.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.200]   - Yeah, I would say eating the way I eat now,
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.220]   I'm leaner at 49, even than I was 10 years ago,
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.060]   or 10 years before that.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:32.060]   I was pretty lean then,
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.460]   and I don't put a ton of attention to tracking calories,
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:38.340]   although, and I want to be very, very clear,
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.660]   I was not paid to say this.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.780]   I've purchased and use Lane's Carbon app.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.660]   He happens to be wearing a shirt that says Carbon today,
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:46.940]   but I've talked about this before
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.860]   on other podcasts and social media,
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.580]   and it's absolutely true
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:54.420]   that there's no endorsement relationship,
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.500]   but I love the app
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.720]   because that was really the first time,
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.980]   probably since college,
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.580]   'cause I started lifting when I was 16.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.540]   Running and lifting has always been my thing
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.380]   since I was 16,
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:09.780]   but since college that I used a tool,
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:14.240]   in this case, Carbon, to basically track what I'm eating,
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.540]   like exactly what I'm eating,
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.580]   and what I like about it
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.140]   is that I can just click on different boxes of things
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.460]   like within the app,
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.380]   and really, it makes it very easy.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.540]   Say, oh, like I ate this thing,
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.860]   white rice from this package,
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:32.380]   and it generally knows products, it knows brands,
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.580]   and it did a really good job of letting me check in
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.060]   and just see how many calories I was consuming,
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.540]   how much protein, how much fat, and from what sources,
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:41.760]   but one of the major takeaways
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.880]   that at least I got from Carbon
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.620]   was that you can arrange your diet
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.540]   any number of different ways.
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.340]   In fact, it has like a really nice little slider
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:50.300]   where you can put in,
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.460]   you want to eat more carbohydrates and less protein even,
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.180]   or you want to have a vegetarian diet, which I don't.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.220]   I'm an omnivore.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.060]   I'm an omnivore.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:59.020]   My dad's Argentine, I like meat.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:18:59.860]   I like meat.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.400]   In fact, I don't even really like fish that much,
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.140]   or chicken, I just like eating meat and eggs,
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.660]   those are my preferred sources, and whey protein.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.180]   Okay, fine.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.420]   But you can arrange things
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.780]   within the context of different types of diets,
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.480]   and I think there's real value
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.260]   to tracking precisely what one eats
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.060]   for even short periods of time.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.420]   And then I confess, I stopped using the app for it,
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.420]   but then I went back to it,
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.800]   and not because things want to drift.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.180]   I think some people really need that consistent checking.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.700]   Other people need to perhaps
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.980]   just kind of eyeball it for themselves.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.740]   But for me, I've found that knowing exactly what I'm doing
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.260]   for some period of time
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:42.060]   allows me to explore things in a way that's really effective.
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.840]   And so I just want to give a nod to Carbon,
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.300]   and I don't do product endorsements on this podcast,
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:51.220]   I do ad reads and that kind of thing for things I love,
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.620]   but I say that because I think it lands squarely
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.980]   in the context of what we're talking about,
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:59.700]   which is that I know what works for me.
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.420]   I also know that some people really love
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.340]   like a giant carb meal in the morning.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.540]   Some people don't like meat.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.540]   Some people, and I think what's so beautiful
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.860]   about the way that you've been talking
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.580]   about science and nutrition in particular
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.980]   over the last few years and still here now,
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.600]   is that you don't really seem to care
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.400]   whether or not people are vegan, vegetarian,
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.160]   omnivore, or even carnivore, dare I say.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.440]   It's just a matter of how people are couching the advice.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.280]   - For sure.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.240]   - And the reason I keep coming back to this
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.120]   is that I really think that you, this discussion,
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.680]   but you in particular are best poised in this whole field
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.920]   of public facing health, nutrition advice
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.960]   to really change the way that the messaging occurs
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.600]   and the way that people hear that messaging.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.020]   And I say that with the utmost respect.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.060]   - That means a lot to me, thank you.
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.740]   - Because most people are not going to go read
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.300]   the meta-analyses.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.860]   And most people don't know how to parse data.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.060]   But I think that paying attention to the words
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.300]   that are spoken right before the advice should be,
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.820]   we need to think, come up with something like,
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.340]   that's like the Norton method.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.580]   Pay attention to the words provided right before the advice.
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:10.580]   - Yeah, I think how you say it makes all the difference.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.560]   And even, take somebody I've had conflict on social media
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.040]   with, which is Paul Saldino,
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.840]   which when he would say something like,
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.480]   "Well, I cut vegetables out of my diet
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.000]   "and I felt like my eczema got better."
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.360]   Okay, that's your experience.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.360]   You can't go, on average,
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.260]   that's definitely not reflected in the research.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.760]   But hey, if you know that you did this thing
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.140]   and you felt better, that's fine.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:38.080]   But how we're overgeneralizing to the population
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.780]   is the problem, right?
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:43.560]   And so I think, I mean, again, I'll say,
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.960]   hey, I calorie cycle a little bit,
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.040]   which again, you can do using the app, right?
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.560]   You can change your days and what not,
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.680]   give you more calories some days,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.360]   more calories other days.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.320]   And I was, I showed a screenshot of it one time
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.360]   and somebody goes, "So why do you do it like that?
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.940]   "Like, is that because it's better this way
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.720]   "for like muscle growth and fat loss?"
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.540]   And I go, "No, 'cause I had a get together
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.860]   "with friends on Saturday
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.320]   "and I knew I was gonna have a couple of beers
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.640]   "and I knew that there was gonna be some fatty food.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.520]   "So I put 4,000 calories on that day
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.320]   "and lost the rest of the week."
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.880]   And they're like, "That's it, that's your reasoning?"
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.920]   Like, yeah, like compliance is the biggest one.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.580]   I will tell people, I'm like,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.940]   the reason that I, and we talked about this earlier,
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.380]   like I have never used performance enhancing drugs.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.280]   I've never even, even when pro-hormones were legal,
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.120]   I didn't use them.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.240]   - And you're not on TRT.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.080]   - Not on TRT.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.620]   - We need to distinguish this
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.300]   because people nowadays like gonna put TRT,
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.340]   well, as long as it's keeping someone's testosterone
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.660]   in the normal reference range,
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.340]   which is somewhere between 300 and 1,200 nanograms
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.840]   per deciliter, then they're like, they're not a,
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.340]   you've never injected a synthetic version of a hormone.
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:55.900]   - No, and like my testosterone, even from like age 18,
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.260]   when the first time I had it measured
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.060]   up until like even a year ago,
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.860]   the lowest it's been, I think it's been like 750
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.680]   and the highest it's been was like 1050.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.060]   And so I obviously don't need it.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:07.900]   - Yeah, you don't need it.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.940]   You're well, you're on the upper, you're high normal.
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.380]   - Right.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.500]   So the reason that I've been able to have so much success,
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.740]   and I get the skepticism, I really do.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.300]   So many people say, I mean, look at how many people
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.140]   are out beating their chest saying they're drug free
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:24.040]   and then it comes out that they weren't, right?
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.820]   But I have been brutally consistent for 25 years.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:31.040]   In 25 years, the longest I ever took off
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.620]   of resistance training was seven days
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:37.660]   and it was after I won world championships in 2022
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.900]   for M1 93 kilo, you know, so I've been able
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.220]   to be really consistent with my training.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.360]   And I always give this comparison of,
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.080]   I think it just really highlights
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.220]   how powerful consistency is.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:54.140]   And it relates back to my favorite quote I've ever heard.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.220]   "The magic you're looking for is in the work
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.700]   you keep attempting to avoid."
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.380]   The work is the hack.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.120]   If people, and I liked what our friend Peter Attia said this
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.180]   when he was talking about biohacks
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.380]   and why I didn't like the term biohacks.
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:07.580]   He said, I don't like that it occupies
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.660]   so much mind space, right?
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.260]   You get people really focused on the minutiae,
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.380]   which is fine if they're already doing the big stuff,
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.760]   if they want to kind of level up a little bit, cool.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.140]   For me, minutiae is where I live
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.660]   because the difference between me winning a powerlifting meet
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.700]   and me losing world championships is 1%, right?
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.420]   But for most people, we just got to get inconsistent.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:32.740]   If I said, Andrew, I want you to become
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.120]   the best three-point shooter you possibly can be,
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.000]   but you can't get any coaching
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.360]   and you can't even watch any tutorials, right?
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   But all you did for 10 years was go out
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.600]   and shoot three-pointers for two hours a day.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.020]   You probably won't go to the NBA,
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:49.880]   but I bet you'd be pretty good at three-pointers, right?
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.760]   And I feel like if people could just get that message
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.960]   and internalize it more.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.280]   No, it's not that you didn't have
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.720]   your carb to fat ratio perfect.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.240]   No, it's not that you ate your carbs at the wrong time.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.880]   No, it's not that you didn't get
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.120]   exactly this much protein.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.780]   It's you just stopped being consistent.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.420]   You stopped doing it.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.740]   Yeah, you were really consistent Monday through Friday,
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:12.580]   and then Saturday and Sunday came and you blew out, right?
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.580]   Like if I'm consistent with my budget Monday through Friday,
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.980]   but then I blow it on the weekend, hey, guess what?
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.380]   That weekend money still counts
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.980]   and calories are the same way.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.020]   - And you enjoy resistance training.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:25.100]   - I love it, I love it.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.140]   - Do you do cardiovascular training?
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.060]   Defined as, 'cause people get,
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.540]   I'm starting to catch flack these days
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.280]   when I say cardio, believe it or not.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.980]   Repetitive motion movement designed
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:41.320]   to elevate your heart rate for 12 minutes or more.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.100]   - So I'll usually do like a five minute warmup
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:44.780]   on the bike before I train.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:48.700]   And then I will also make sure I get
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.140]   at least 10,000 steps on average per day.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.980]   I usually average more closer to like 11,000,
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.180]   but I don't do a lot of purposeful cardio.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.180]   Now, what I will tell you is my average heart rate
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.800]   in lifting sessions is about 140 to 150.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.700]   So if the definition of cardio is that,
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:08.980]   then I'm getting cardio.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.800]   And actually when I've had, you know,
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.220]   most of my markers of metabolic health assessed,
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:16.820]   I'm very metabolically healthy.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.540]   I've got good, actually it was funny.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:25.540]   I just competed at nationals in late May and won.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:30.540]   So I won, and actually, again, very cool kind of side story.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:33.100]   We talked about the injuries I've dealt with.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:36.300]   And so I'm 42 now, it's been an eight year journey.
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.140]   And I mean, going from, I've had back pain so bad
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.180]   I couldn't even get up the floor.
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:43.180]   Needed a cortisone injection in my spine at one point,
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:45.020]   just to be able to stand up.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.460]   And multiple hip injuries,
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.140]   a lot of chronic pain I dealt with.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:53.220]   And I'm very proud of myself that I never gave up
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.540]   'cause in my heart of hearts, I felt like
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.340]   I haven't hit my last PR yet.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.540]   And at nationals this past year,
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.220]   I actually set a national deadlift record
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.260]   for my age and weight.
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.100]   - Congratulations.
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.540]   - And it was actually an unofficial world record
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.420]   and qualified for world championships.
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:13.220]   But one of the team USA coaches, his name's Matt Gary,
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.260]   him and his wife Susie are like,
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.460]   in evidence-based powerlifting, they are the goats.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:20.860]   And there is no better game day coach
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.020]   to pick attempts than Matt and Susie Gary.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.780]   Other than maybe my coach, Ben Escrow, shout out to Ben.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.700]   But they were at the meet
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.980]   and we've known each other for 15 years.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.300]   And the next day I came down into the lobby
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.420]   and they're down eating breakfast.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.700]   And Matt's like, "Your ears must be burning.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.780]   We were just talking about you."
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:39.900]   And I'm like, "Oh, what?"
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.580]   He goes, "You know what I'm impressed with?"
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:45.020]   He goes, "Your cardiovascular fitness."
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.220]   And you know, powerlifting meets nine lifts, right?
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.420]   You get three attempts on squat, bench press, deadlift.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.700]   And so I kind of like looked at him weird.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:55.100]   He goes, "We were there between warmups and finishing.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.060]   It was about four hours.
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.780]   You never sat down.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:00.700]   You were yelling the entire time.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.220]   You're talking the entire time."
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.900]   'Cause I'm a very extroverted, active person.
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.460]   Then when I'm firing myself up, it comes out very extra.
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.940]   He's like, "You're yelling the entire time
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.740]   and you never were tired."
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:15.500]   And again, when I look at my heart rate
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.340]   and I was at the meet,
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.860]   I think the average was like 150 or 160.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.020]   And so some people would not consider that cardio,
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:26.740]   but I would say my cardiovascular system does all right.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.140]   - I would argue it might be related
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:30.780]   to you're not getting sick very often.
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:32.540]   It's very clear that activation
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.940]   of the sympathetic nervous system
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.220]   is one main driver of the immune system.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.280]   This is why often people observe
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.500]   that they go through a very stressful period of life
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.940]   and then they go on vacation and they get sick,
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.360]   or they're taking care of a loved one
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.700]   and that person either gets better or passes away,
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.940]   there's some ending to that caretaking,
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:52.340]   and then they get sick.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:53.660]   - I have observed that exact thing.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.020]   When I went through my first divorce,
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.660]   I was also involved in a lawsuit
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.940]   with a company that I used to own a portion of.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.420]   It's a very long story,
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.900]   ended up having a good ending for me.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.980]   And all that stuff kind of resolved itself,
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.020]   the divorce, the lawsuit, everything resolved itself
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.980]   in about a six-week time period.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.260]   As soon as it resolved,
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:15.320]   I got sicker than I ever had been in my entire life.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.180]   I got the actual influenza.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.500]   I tell people after that experience in 2018,
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.780]   I go, here's words I'll never use again.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:24.440]   I think I might have the flu.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.080]   No, you know, after you've had it for sure, you know.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.740]   But it was like my body had just,
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.100]   maybe it's a little bit of woo,
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.300]   but it was like my body,
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.460]   I dragged it across the finish line and then said,
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.820]   okay, we'll see you in a couple of weeks
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:41.940]   'cause we're taking a break.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.220]   - When you think about human evolution,
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.580]   I mean, these are just so stories.
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.460]   Anytime people talk about human evolution, by the way,
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.460]   like no one really knows,
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.960]   but the idea that, you know, if there was a famine
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.980]   or you need to take care of children in famine,
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:54.420]   the idea that you would be more vulnerable to disease
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:56.220]   at those moments, sure.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:00.940]   But it's also true that the catecholamines,
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:03.080]   dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.460]   activate certain components of the immune system
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.620]   that protect you against things.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.340]   I mean, it's not gonna protect you against everything,
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.580]   but it's when you relax and rest finally
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:12.900]   that you are more vulnerable to incoming infections.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.220]   - And we see this with pain too, right?
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.700]   Like you had Sean Mackey on talking about this stuff
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:20.460]   where, you know, I forget who was talking about this.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.740]   I remember listening to a podcast with,
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.300]   it wasn't him, but it was another pain expert.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.420]   And they said, you know, because your beliefs about pain,
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.100]   your stress level, your sleep,
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:32.060]   like your psychological milieu actually matter
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.620]   in terms of your pain experience.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:37.060]   In fact, the single biggest lever I've pulled
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:40.600]   to get me consistently training and pain-free
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.500]   was becoming more relaxed and less stressed out
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.020]   all the time and managing my psychological stress better.
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.520]   You know, when you're not vibrating
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.460]   and spun up all the time, your body has,
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:52.060]   again, this is a little woo-woo-y,
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:53.620]   but I think you have more energy.
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.380]   I mean, if you look at- - It makes sense.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.220]   It makes sense.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.260]   I mean, those catecholamines,
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.820]   I mean, there are other molecules involved too,
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:03.720]   but that, you know, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.020]   you know, cocktail is driving us forward in motion
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.860]   and thinking, you know, all the time.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:15.260]   And if you're putting thoughts into one set of things,
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.340]   they're not going elsewhere.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.540]   Like you said, it's all trade-offs.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.540]   - I read something from a PhD in psychology
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.500]   who said, "Stop thinking about your problems.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:22.340]   "The problem is you're thinking
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.860]   "about your problems too much.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.680]   "Thinking about it doesn't solve them.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.380]   "And just ruminating on them makes it worse."
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:30.300]   And actually, again, if you look at like pain literature,
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.380]   fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome,
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:35.820]   very close ties to psychological stress.
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.520]   And we were talking earlier about like,
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.620]   if you look at the data on mortality,
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:44.260]   cardiovascular disease, cancer with ACEs scores,
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.700]   which is Adverse Childhood Events Scale.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:50.660]   So zero being best, you were loved as a child,
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:53.180]   that sort of thing, you had no real big worries,
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.000]   10 being basically abused.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.700]   There's like a very, I don't wanna say very tight,
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.260]   but there's a dose response of ACEs scores
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:06.360]   on the risk of mortality.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.500]   So what happens in the body affects the mind,
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.060]   and what happens in the mind affects the body.
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.700]   And we were talking about with pain literature,
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:15.340]   what happens in the mind affects the body
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:17.700]   in your pain experience.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.580]   And even just something like sleep.
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.820]   There was a study done where they looked
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.460]   at military members, and they had eight hours of sleep
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:26.440]   versus four hours of sleep,
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.220]   and they looked at the risk of acute injury.
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:34.220]   236% increased risk in the people getting four hours
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.700]   of sleep versus eight hours.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.940]   And now here's where people get this wrong.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:38.780]   Somebody reached out to me and said,
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:40.860]   "Well, I got four hours of sleep last night, should I?"
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:44.220]   No, no, no, one bad night of sleep doesn't do that.
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.740]   Sleep is a cumulative effect.
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:49.180]   Just like if you have a week's long worth of bad sleep,
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.580]   but then you sleep 12 hours on the weekend,
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.060]   you're not making up that sleep debt.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.100]   It's more about what you're doing time over time.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.020]   - Just like nutrition, just like training.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:57.860]   - Exactly.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.740]   And so this actually brings me to,
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.620]   I know we kind of have gone down the rabbit hole here,
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.160]   but when you look at,
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.660]   Ben Carpenter did a great example of this.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.700]   He has a good social media account.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:14.020]   He had a jar of blue marbles and a jar of green marbles.
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.420]   He said, "Let's pretend that this is all junk food.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:20.920]   "These green marbles are all junk food, ultra processed.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:25.920]   "This blue is minimally processed whole foods, right?
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:31.140]   "If my diet is mostly junk, and I add one good meal,"
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:33.120]   and he puts a blue marble in the green,
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.020]   "did it change things?"
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:35.980]   No.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.940]   And everybody knows that, right?
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.380]   Like if you eat a mostly junk diet,
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.260]   you have one good, one salad or one good meal,
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.840]   it's not gonna change things.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.100]   So why does everybody think if we take one from here
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.980]   and put it over here, that it drastically changes things?
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:50.820]   Because it doesn't.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:53.920]   It's about what you do consistently over the course of time.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.440]   And so speaking of,
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.940]   we're talking about the mind affecting the body,
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.700]   but then the body also affects the mind.
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.600]   And so there was just a study published,
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.780]   I just covered it on my channel,
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.500]   where they took men with general anxiety disorder
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.540]   and major depressive disorder,
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:14.420]   and they had them resistance train two times a week
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:17.940]   for 25 minutes a session, 50 minutes total, eight weeks.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.460]   - It's not much training.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.100]   - I think it was like six hours and 40 minutes
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.900]   of total training over the entire two months.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.180]   Now, in statistics, you're familiar with an effect size,
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.860]   which is basically how meaningful is an effect,
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.100]   because you can have a significant effect
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:32.200]   that isn't very meaningful
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.000]   if you have enough subject number.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.700]   So when we say things like an effect size,
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:41.940]   0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is considered moderate,
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:44.460]   and 0.8 is considered large, anything above 0.8.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:50.540]   SSRIs are typically in the 0.3 to 0.5 range.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:53.540]   I think in like best case scenarios,
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.500]   they get up around a 0.8, 0.7, 0.8.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.560]   The effect size for resistance training two times a week,
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.380]   25 minutes a day for eight weeks was a 1.7
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:05.700]   on major depressive disorder.
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:06.820]   - Wow.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.260]   - Anybody who's a scientist out there,
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.300]   if they hear effect size of 1.7,
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.800]   they do exactly what you did.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.220]   Their eyebrows go up and they go,
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.980]   "Are they sure that's right?"
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:17.780]   You don't see effect sizes like that very often.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.940]   And I want to be very clear,
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:22.720]   I'm not saying do resistance training in place of SSRIs.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.560]   That's a very-- - Of course not.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.260]   But these individuals had not trained previously.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:28.500]   - They hadn't trained before, yeah.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.640]   They were healthy or actually don't know
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.580]   the specific characteristics,
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:35.240]   but I knew they were coming from like not training, right?
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.800]   Now, hey, like, listen, both these things could be true.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.520]   Maybe somebody needs to get an SSRI
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.040]   because like depressed people
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.280]   don't even want to get out of bed a lot of times, right?
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.360]   So getting them to the gym,
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.040]   even if they know it's going to help them is a hard,
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.600]   it's a hard swing.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.180]   So maybe coupling that.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:53.900]   But that's just resistance training
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.100]   and that affects this, right?
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:01.520]   So I think one of the biggest revolutions
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.900]   we're going to see in science
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.820]   is the broad application of biopsychosocial
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:09.280]   across a bunch of different disciplines
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.260]   and stop thinking about,
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.620]   well, your body's a bag of meat
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:15.580]   and it's attached to your brain.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.060]   And if you poke the bag, punch the bag,
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.220]   burn the bag, cut the bag, brain goes owie.
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.700]   And I think we're going to start
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.740]   thinking about things much differently.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.180]   And I think it's going to open up a lot more in science.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.820]   And in fact, honestly,
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:30.000]   if I had to go back and do a PhD again,
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.540]   it would be in some sort of like psychology or whatnot,
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:38.540]   because I just think there's so much untapped in that realm.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:41.060]   And I was actually talking about this
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:45.020]   with somebody the other day and it's pure anecdote.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.600]   I'm completely speculating.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.740]   I have yet to see an interview
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.700]   with somebody who's in their nineties or hundreds
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.320]   who sounds really stressed out.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.300]   They're mostly like DGAF, right?
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:00.180]   And when you ask them what they did like,
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:02.300]   most of them say, "Oh, I drink wine every night."
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.700]   Or the one I remember, she was like 110.
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.400]   She's like, "Yeah, I drink a Dr. Pepper every day,"
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.240]   or whatever.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.540]   It strikes me that, and again, genetics matter,
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.380]   their lifestyle matters.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:14.420]   I'm not saying any of that stuff doesn't matter.
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.900]   I don't see, at least in my experience,
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:21.560]   people who make it old age,
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.340]   they're not usually very spun up all the time.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.900]   I just, I haven't observed that.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:30.260]   I don't know if you've seen similar observations or-
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.180]   - They seem to enjoy life.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:36.020]   I have a grandfather on one side that died earlier,
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:37.360]   but a grandfather on the other side
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.820]   who lived into his nineties and he ate a steak every day.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.100]   He smoked till pretty late in life
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.020]   before he eventually quit.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:49.540]   He had ice cream dessert after every dinner.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.460]   He's Argentine, so they stack their meals
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:53.220]   toward the end of the day, definitely.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.900]   He liked walking.
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:57.340]   I guess the point is that he was always interested
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.620]   in what was in the newspapers,
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.500]   but he wouldn't get riled up about it.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.340]   He liked walking.
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:02.500]   He really enjoyed life.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.820]   If there's one key characteristic to describe him
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.900]   is he really enjoyed life.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.860]   Now, he didn't take the best care of himself
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.420]   in the sense that had he perhaps never smoked
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.780]   or quit earlier or dropped the excess calories,
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.520]   he might've lived an additional two or three years,
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.780]   but he was really happy until the end.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.740]   - And that's the lesson there is we're not saying
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.060]   that that stuff doesn't matter.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.300]   He would have gotten better results if he hadn't smoked,
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.420]   if he had paid more attention to his nutrition,
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.380]   that sort of thing.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:32.420]   But we have to keep in mind,
[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:35.140]   like what is the hierarchy of importance
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.220]   and the power here, right?
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:41.340]   And so I'll give you an example.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.820]   We're going to zoom in on the blade of grass,
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:43.900]   but I believe it relates back
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:46.180]   to this conversation we're having.
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:47.740]   So we know creatine works
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.460]   'cause we've got thousands
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.260]   of double-blind placebo-controlled trials
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.060]   showing that creatine works, right?
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:56.940]   But there was a study where they gave people creatine
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.020]   or didn't give them creatine
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.340]   and then randomly told them if they got it or not.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:03.900]   Meaning you had people who didn't get creatine got creatine,
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:06.780]   who didn't get it, told they didn't get it,
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:09.700]   people who got it, told they got it,
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:12.540]   people who got it, told they didn't get it.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:14.380]   And what they found was the results,
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.260]   and I forget what they actually specifically measured,
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:18.100]   but the results basically were like,
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.140]   not what they got, what they told them, okay?
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:23.380]   Now, people will misinterpret that as,
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.700]   well, see, creatine doesn't work.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.620]   No, no, no, it works.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:29.700]   It just means your beliefs about what creatine does
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.020]   are more powerful than what it actually does.
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:34.860]   Just like actually there's a similar trial with caffeine.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:39.860]   And I'm thinking about there was a study,
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:42.620]   Brad, I don't have the specific citation,
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:47.620]   but they had two groups of men train drug-free.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:51.160]   One group, they told they were getting steroids.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.380]   That group gained significantly more strength
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.220]   and muscle mass.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:58.060]   Now, I would argue that's probably
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.460]   'cause they're going into training sessions
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.540]   believing that they can train harder,
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.980]   believing that they will recover better.
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:06.540]   But that goes to show the power of placebo
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:07.780]   and the power of belief.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:11.220]   When I say placebo, people think what I'm saying
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.420]   is you're lying about your experience.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.140]   That is not what I'm saying at all.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.820]   I think your experience is probably quite valid.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:22.980]   What I'm saying is it may not be due to the thing
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:27.980]   you think it's due to, but your beliefs about the thing.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:32.980]   And so where I get really focused is
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:35.260]   let's do the big stuff right,
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:38.580]   because so many people are so worried about little stuff.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.380]   And one of the things I'll tell them is,
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:43.780]   hey, I have no data to back this up,
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.260]   but my intuition tells me that the amount of stress
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:48.020]   you're spending on these small variables
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.780]   is probably killing you faster
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.420]   than if you got those variables wrong.
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:56.700]   And if we could just focus on the big rocks first,
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.580]   and if we can pick up some pebbles
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.180]   after we get the big rocks, great,
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:03.140]   but don't drop the big rocks trying to pick up pebbles.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.820]   - I love it, and I love this example
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.780]   of the creatine experiment,
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.980]   because just to repeat the conclusion,
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:12.580]   because I want to make sure that people
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:17.220]   don't take away the wrong conclusion, creatine works.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.860]   - Absolutely.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:23.860]   - But your belief about creatine works more in this case.
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:27.780]   So two things can work, one more than the other,
[01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:30.380]   and the placebo, aka belief effects,
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:32.500]   are very, very powerful.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.340]   - Exactly.
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.060]   - I completely agree with you there.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:36.900]   Wonderful way to set the stage
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:39.980]   for some of the specific questions that were asked
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.660]   when I said on social media,
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:45.260]   I'm going to sit down with Lane Norton again.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:46.740]   And I'm very curious about some of these as well.
[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:50.540]   So I'll inject some of my own experience and questions.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:53.780]   Training to failure and reps in reserve.
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:56.540]   We should define these a little bit.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.820]   And before we get into it,
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.940]   it's fun to have these kinds of conversations nowadays
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.300]   about resistance training,
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:05.420]   knowing that both men and women should resistance train.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:07.420]   People who want bigger muscles and who don't
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.360]   should resistance train.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.900]   Because in the past, it was always about like bodybuilding
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.740]   and pre-season football and people going to the military.
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:16.380]   I think thanks to the great work that you've done,
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.820]   but I'll just give a particular shout out
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:22.120]   to some of the women in the nutrition and fitness space,
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.600]   namely Dr. Gabrielle Lyon in terms of menopause,
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.060]   perimenopause, Dr. Mary Claire Haver,
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:31.980]   and women in that sector really emphasizing
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.580]   the key need for resistance training.
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.900]   There are other names as well,
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.180]   but really championing the importance
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.500]   of resistance training.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.300]   Training to failure in my book means
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:44.180]   when you can't move the weight by whatever means
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:50.140]   anymore in good form, in proper form, that's failure.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:51.740]   So we're not talking about four straps.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.900]   We're not talking about swaying the upper body
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.700]   or using momentum.
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.580]   So training to failure,
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:00.140]   you can't move the resistance anymore in good form.
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.260]   And reps in reserve, my understanding is
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:05.320]   one's own subjective understanding about how close they are
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.460]   to that point of failure.
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:08.300]   Do I have that right?
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:11.940]   - Yeah, so you define failure the way I define failure,
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:13.420]   which is you cannot take the weight
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:16.340]   through another concentric repetition without breaking form.
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:21.340]   Reps in reserve would be an RIR of one
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:23.700]   means you stopped one rep shy of failure.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:26.260]   RIR of two, you stopped two reps shy of failure
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:27.900]   and so on and so forth, right?
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:31.020]   And so I would define those that way.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:34.220]   - Okay, so with those definitions in mind,
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:37.020]   is training to failure more effective
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:41.060]   at generating strength and hypertrophy increases
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:44.060]   than if one keeps a few reps in reserve?
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.380]   And of course we have to balance this
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:48.420]   against all the factors related to recovery, et cetera.
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.840]   But assuming that one follows a program of doing,
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.880]   and I'm really just trying to cut us
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.100]   right through the middle here.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.220]   Let's say two or three exercises per muscle group
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:02.100]   and does after a sufficient warmup,
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:08.360]   let's say two to five sets that we're going to call work sets.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:12.620]   You could imagine an extreme scenario
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.580]   where every single work set is taken to failure.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:19.460]   You could imagine taking only the last set
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:20.720]   of each exercise to failure.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.020]   You can imagine taking none of them to failure.
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:27.380]   Assuming adequate volume is achieved across the week.
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:29.700]   My understanding is this is 10 to 20 sets
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.780]   per muscle group across the week.
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.900]   It could be distributed across different workouts
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:36.560]   or all done in one workout.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.020]   Is training to failure going to generate
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.120]   more strength and hypertrophy
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.020]   than leaving some repetitions in reserve?
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:45.820]   So let's start with the extreme scenario.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:48.240]   I go to failure on every single set
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.980]   and I do what I need to to recover.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.360]   It doesn't matter if it's only doing that muscle group
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.200]   once per week or spread out multiple times per week.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.440]   I'm doing what I need to to recover in between.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.340]   My genetics, my hormone status, my sleep,
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:03.760]   my nutrition, on and on.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.340]   Is going to failure more effective
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:09.340]   than not going to failure?
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.720]   - This is going to generate a lot of discussion
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.560]   in the comments.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.400]   I can't wait to see it.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.460]   So I'm going to cite quite a bit of work
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:18.380]   from my powerlifting coach, Zach Robinson,
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.240]   because he is at FAU, just finished his PhD
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.960]   and did a lot of meta-aggressions and meta-analyses
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:26.480]   on this exact topic.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.580]   So I'll give you the answers first
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.120]   that are straight down the line scientific answers
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.800]   and then I'll explain things.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.720]   For muscular hypertrophy,
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.520]   you need to get close to failure.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.720]   But you probably don't need to train to failure
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.620]   to maximize hypertrophy, but you got to get pretty close.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:47.640]   You can be stronger, but to maximize strength,
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:51.420]   you're probably better off not touching failure very often.
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:53.920]   So there are a few studies now looking at this,
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.060]   showing that, I think there was one study recently,
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.480]   and I can't remember the exact details,
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.380]   but I remember it being pretty well designed.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:04.080]   And the takeaway was, hypertrophy was similar
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.040]   between the groups, but the group that went to failure,
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:08.560]   or stayed a few reps shy of failure,
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:11.540]   actually got stronger compared to the group
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.000]   that was taking most sets to failure.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.840]   - And did they control for total volume of work?
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.280]   - Yes, so- - Okay, 'cause I can imagine
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.960]   not going to failure, you can do more sets
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.080]   because you've got- - And that's exactly-
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.640]   - More quote unquote gas in the tank, right?
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.540]   - And practically that may be a benefit
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.160]   of stopping shy of failure, right?
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.360]   But yeah, they control for those variables.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.800]   So when we talk about volume,
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.680]   the way we define that is essentially number of hard sets,
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.280]   which a hard set would be a set close to failure.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.680]   The general consensus is within five reps
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.360]   of failure is considered a hard set.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:45.320]   Now, what I will tell people is,
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.760]   that may not sound like much,
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:49.880]   most people have never truly pushed themselves to failure.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:52.780]   Okay, and I'll give some practical examples of me.
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:56.240]   So my best set of squats ever, I did 530 for 10.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.160]   This was a long time ago.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.000]   - Yikes.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.820]   - I, when I finished that set, I actually,
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.920]   somebody had to come save me
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.240]   because I couldn't fully lock out my lumbar
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.760]   and I couldn't get the bar on my right side
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.580]   all the way back up.
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.480]   So they had to run over in the gym and help me.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.860]   After that set, I laid down and I physically
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:18.120]   hardly couldn't move for about 15 minutes.
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.080]   - So this is, you know, gun to the head type failure.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.720]   - Yes, you do as many as you can.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.960]   Your family's been kidnapped.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.560]   If you don't get these 10 reps, you're, you know.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.520]   - All those mental games.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.560]   - That sort of thing.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.840]   And I mean, I was done.
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:32.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.320]   And so one of the things I'll tell people is,
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:38.480]   the first five reps of that set were still hard.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.660]   They still felt hard, right?
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.140]   And so people will say,
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:43.880]   "Oh, you stop a rep or two shy of failure.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:45.340]   "You're trained like a,"
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.060]   I'm like, "So you're telling me
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.660]   "if I stopped two reps shy on that one,
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:50.860]   "that that's an easy set?"
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.540]   'Cause it's not, I can tell you that.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:55.700]   And the reason I'm giving this background
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.340]   is because in research studies
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.140]   where they have people who are like
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.680]   beginners or intermediates
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.900]   and they ask them to rate their RIR,
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.040]   they tend to underestimate their RIR, right?
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.360]   So they'll say, you know,
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.440]   during a set, say your RIR,
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.000]   and they might say two.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.880]   And what they find is when the researchers
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:19.080]   push them to true failure,
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.760]   yell at them, crank the music,
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.220]   get them really psyched up,
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:24.360]   they get five more reps
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.360]   than they think they'll get on average, right?
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.840]   So most people,
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.600]   if you've never actually taken things to true failure,
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.240]   you actually probably don't know what it is.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.960]   So I do think it's useful to train to failure at times.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.580]   - I think you make a very important point,
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:40.140]   which is that occasionally training to failure
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.260]   gives you a sense of what failure really is for you.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:45.440]   And no one can really tell you that,
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.300]   only you can tell you that and experience that.
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.740]   But if I understand correctly earlier, you said,
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.440]   once you know what failure is for you,
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.300]   then if strength gains are your goal,
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:59.100]   and I think more and more people, by the way,
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.500]   are training for strength who don't want hypertrophy,
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.820]   at least not across every muscle group.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:06.260]   I think when I talk to the general public,
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:07.120]   which I do a lot,
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.340]   I get the sense that men and women are like,
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.940]   yeah, I'll lift weights.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.100]   I can see the value of that.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:14.620]   Would love a little bit more muscle here,
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.660]   a little bit more muscle there,
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:18.300]   but they don't wanna be generally larger.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.980]   And yet they can understand and appreciate the value
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:25.060]   of getting stronger everywhere.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.700]   'Cause being strong across your whole body
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.160]   is one of the core definitions of health.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.260]   - Being strong is fun.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.740]   So again, for hypertrophy,
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.700]   doesn't seem to matter if you take every set to failure
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.020]   or stop a couple reps shy.
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:42.020]   I would argue that probably you'd want to leave
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:45.980]   most reps, most sets shy of failure.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:47.360]   And if you're gonna take one to failure,
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.780]   take the last set of an exercise to failure.
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.780]   'Cause then you can get whatever benefits might be there.
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:54.340]   But if you take the first set to failure,
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:56.300]   I mean, imagine if I did that set of 10
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:59.740]   with 530 on squats as my first set to...
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.360]   What am I gonna get the next set if I try to do 530?
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:03.860]   I can tell you based on how I felt,
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.280]   maybe three reps, maybe, you know?
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:08.620]   And so your performance is just gonna
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:10.900]   really drop off a cliff if you're going to true failure
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.540]   on like a compound exercise.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:14.340]   Isolation is a little bit different.
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:19.540]   And so I would say, whereas if you probably could have done
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:23.620]   like sets with six, seven reps for multiple sets
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:26.320]   and then have gone to failure on your last one, right?
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:31.380]   Now, it may seem a little bit counterintuitive.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.780]   Why would it be the same for hypertrophy
[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:35.300]   but different for strength?
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.100]   Well, with strength, you also have to think about
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.460]   stimulus to fatigue ratio
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:41.900]   because fatigue will mass strength, right?
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:43.620]   And I know this because I've...
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.700]   Like when I overreach for powerlifting competitions,
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.340]   which is basically like we're taking me
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:50.660]   a little bit past my point of what I can recover from.
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:55.140]   I mean, I've had literally before nationals in 2017,
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.260]   I was warming up on deadlift
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.460]   in my last heavy deadlift session,
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.260]   like 10 days before the meet.
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:03.580]   And I went to pull my final warmup, which is 585,
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:05.340]   and I couldn't budget off the ground.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:09.980]   I was so tired, sore, I couldn't get...
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.840]   It was like, I couldn't get my body
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.640]   to do what I wanted it to do.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:18.900]   10 days later, I pulled 716, right?
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:22.540]   It's amazing what fatigue will mask.
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:26.460]   And so if you're always training to failure,
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:27.300]   you're gonna be training
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.420]   under pretty high fatigue circumstances.
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.580]   Doesn't really matter for muscle growth
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:33.300]   'cause it's really just about doing enough hard sets
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.820]   and putting that mechanical tension on the muscle.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:40.240]   With strength, you also have to think about like,
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:43.360]   what is the most pure form of strength?
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.580]   It's force production, right?
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.800]   And force is mass times acceleration.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:49.420]   So you have a mass component,
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:51.580]   you have a speed component.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:55.140]   And so this is actually Zach Robinson
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.180]   and his company, Data-Driven Strength,
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:59.300]   who I've been coaching with for three years.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.120]   I heard them on a podcast,
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:05.540]   and he was giving his hypothesis
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:08.940]   of how to optimize strength in a powerlifter.
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:10.100]   And I remember thinking,
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:11.900]   I really like the way this guy is thinking.
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:14.100]   He's thinking outside the box and it makes a lot of sense.
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.940]   So one of his things was,
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.300]   if you're training close to fatigue all the time,
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.040]   and the goal is strength,
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.420]   think about what that means
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:23.980]   in terms of your force production.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:28.940]   So let's say you do a set of eight reps, right?
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.620]   Your first few are pretty fast.
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:32.260]   And then by the end, they're pretty slow.
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:33.380]   The load hasn't changed.
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:35.180]   So what happens to your force production?
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:39.020]   Your force production is going pretty far down.
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:41.100]   He said, I don't really want my athletes
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.300]   grinding reps in training.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:45.940]   I want them to hit some heavy singles
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:47.500]   and doubles and triples because they need that
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:48.640]   because that's a skill.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.740]   You have to have those neurological,
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:51.740]   everybody's done this where they go,
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.740]   well, I hit this for 10 reps
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.220]   and here's what my one rep max should be.
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:56.380]   And then they go in and get stapled with it, right?
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:58.020]   Because it doesn't necessarily translate
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.980]   because a one rep max or the purest form of strength
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.500]   is a very specific skill.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.620]   If you've never trained it,
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:06.980]   it's very difficult to get accustomed to.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:10.780]   So we wanna hit some,
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:12.540]   his idea was in workouts,
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:13.940]   we're gonna hit a heavy top set,
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:17.100]   heavy single, double or triple or whatever it is.
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:18.820]   And then our back offsets,
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:21.220]   instead of taking those close to failure,
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:23.780]   instead of doing say, well, we'll do,
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.780]   75% of your training max for sets of eight
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:31.540]   and have you getting pretty close to failure.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:32.540]   Instead of doing three sets of eight,
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:37.220]   why don't we just do like six sets of four with that weight?
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.500]   Because now you're doing those first four reps,
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.780]   which you can move that weight faster.
[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:45.280]   You're having greater force production
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.140]   and creating the same good stimulus,
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.500]   but with less fatigue.
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:52.820]   And so again, that was kind of the hypothesis
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:56.380]   and he did a meta-analysis, meta-regression
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:57.220]   that supported this.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:58.860]   And now some of the randomized control trials
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:01.580]   have come out and shown something similar.
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:03.380]   And in my experience,
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:07.260]   I was honestly shocked at,
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.060]   because he had all kinds of stuff to deal with
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:10.060]   when he first started training me.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.820]   'Cause I still was dealing with a lot of back pain,
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.220]   a lot of hip pain.
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:15.940]   I hadn't really gotten that under control yet.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:18.260]   And when I got ready for Worlds in 2022,
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:20.480]   which I think we did our first podcast
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.660]   like the week after I had won Worlds,
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:27.380]   I worked up to being able to do like two or three hard sets
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:29.060]   of squats a week and deadlifts.
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:29.900]   And that was all I could do.
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:32.500]   That was all my body could tolerate before I get pain.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.300]   And so we did a lot of low load,
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.220]   relatively low, low for me,
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:45.340]   60 to 70% 1RM for low rep number sets,
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:48.160]   but trying to move it as fast as possible
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.380]   to keep that pain under control for me,
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:51.420]   but to get the stimulus.
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.820]   And I was shocked at how strong I got
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.020]   because before in 2014, 15,
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.620]   when I was winning open national titles,
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:02.340]   I mean, I was doing 15, 20 hard sets of squats
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:06.260]   and deadlifts a week and way more for bench press.
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:07.180]   And so I always thought,
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.300]   well, that's how much I need
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:09.820]   to get to that level of strength.
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:10.780]   And even now, like,
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:13.820]   so we've been able to keep progressing it.
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:15.960]   Now I'm doing probably more like six,
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:18.820]   seven harder sets of those exercises per week.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.700]   And I'm basically back to the strongest I've ever been.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:22.980]   We're doing way less sets.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:24.540]   And I think a lot of it is,
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:26.180]   we have learned to find the sweet spot
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.960]   with managing that stimulus to fatigue ratio.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.360]   So all that to say,
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:33.220]   if your goal is building strength,
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:34.380]   it's mostly about, you know,
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:37.460]   doing enough like heavy lifting
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.520]   that you actually do get stronger.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.440]   And then if you wanna train closer to failure,
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.180]   you can, because again,
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.940]   most of my audience isn't trying to be a power lifter, right?
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:50.040]   - No, but I think a lot of the audience
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.220]   would like to be stronger
[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:53.660]   and not necessarily grow their muscles bigger,
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.140]   except in a few specific places on the body.
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:58.780]   - And so this would be the protocol.
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:01.260]   There we go, protocols, little plug.
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:03.780]   This would be a protocol for probably,
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.340]   not necessarily like growing the most muscle mass,
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:07.740]   but getting stronger
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.740]   because you're not training so close to failure.
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:12.400]   But, you know, obviously you're trying to move,
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.460]   as Zach says, whatever that given load is,
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:18.080]   you wanna move it as quickly as possible.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.220]   And so, and there's actually also data to show
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:23.800]   that like if you train slower purposefully,
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.560]   that it's not as good for strength.
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.560]   So they actually, there was a,
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:28.820]   I think a meta-analysis recently
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:32.300]   where they looked at either concentric repetition
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.820]   of more than two seconds or less than two seconds
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.780]   and saw strength outcomes were better
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:40.220]   in people taking less than two seconds to complete a rep.
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:43.160]   - Interesting, so that's the concentric phase,
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:45.000]   the lowering phase, the eccentric phase.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.280]   - No, we're not sure about that yet.
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:47.120]   - Interesting.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:50.440]   - So, I mean, we do use some tempo training in my training,
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:53.920]   but it's mostly because like me doing a slower tempo squat,
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:55.760]   if my back starts acting up,
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:00.320]   I can do some squatting
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:03.360]   and not really hit that pain trigger as much.
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.760]   So, but I'm still trying to move the concentric
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.120]   as quickly as possible.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.840]   And so I don't know about that.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.660]   It doesn't matter how slowly you move the concentric
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:12.120]   versus how fast you move it.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.780]   But yeah, what I would say is,
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:16.620]   when it comes to building muscle,
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:18.340]   really the world is your oyster.
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:23.340]   The research really shows machines versus free weights.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.100]   - Low reps, high reps.
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:27.780]   - Low reps, high reps, going to failure,
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.000]   stopping a few reps shy.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.220]   It all builds the same amount of muscle for the most part.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.420]   - But you have to work hard.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:34.540]   - But you gotta work hard.
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.060]   Yeah, you gotta be consistent with it.
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:39.600]   Obviously like the theme of this podcast, right?
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:42.040]   But you can do it anyway.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:44.820]   And if we look at the, I mean, obviously anecdotal,
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.280]   but if we look at the history of the Mr. Olympia
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:47.520]   is they all train very differently.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.320]   You know, I mean, Ronnie Coleman.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:50.420]   I mean, I'm sure you remember
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:52.320]   when the "Unbelievable" came out,
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:55.200]   his DVD back in like 2001,
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.680]   where he's tossing around 200 pound dumbbells
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.080]   and he's doing seven, 800 pound squats,
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:01.480]   600 pound front squats.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.800]   And everybody's just looking at this like, my God.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:05.840]   And then you watch somebody like Phil Heath train,
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:09.280]   who again, one of the greatest Mr. Olympia's of all time.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.840]   Phil mostly did machines,
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:14.880]   but he built obviously a great amount of muscle.
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.280]   Now people will say, well, they're on steroids.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.280]   All those guys.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:19.760]   - Yeah, it's all controlled.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:22.120]   - Trust me, it's an equal playing field
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.200]   'cause they're all doing it, right?
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:27.320]   - And the research shows anywhere from whatever,
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:30.540]   you know, five to 30 repetitions can generate hypertrophy
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:33.760]   as long as the final few repetitions are really hard
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:37.120]   and volume is adjusted.
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.100]   I really like-
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:39.460]   - There is no hypertrophy rep range
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:40.520]   like people used to think of as,
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:43.300]   oh, it's like six to 15 reps is hypertrophy.
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.080]   Now I think practically it makes sense
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.720]   to do a lot of your sets in that range
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.840]   because if you're trying to do 30 reps
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.680]   getting close to failure,
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.120]   I mean, gosh, I'm gonna run out of breath
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:52.960]   if I'm doing any kind of compound.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:55.120]   - Also if you work out in a-
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.240]   - It's a little boring for me.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.000]   - Yes, and if you work out in a gym
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.480]   where there are other people, like be kind.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:00.800]   You know, like other people are gonna need
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:02.080]   the space and the equipment.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:04.380]   So, you know, it could take forever, you know,
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:09.380]   10 sets of 30, like that's impolite.
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:12.760]   So we're only half kidding there.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.600]   One of the more common questions
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:20.480]   is about training for people 50 years old and older.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:24.080]   And I love the fact that we're talking
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.080]   so much about strength.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:28.320]   This seems to be one of the key evolutions in this field.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:30.280]   Again, in my opinion,
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:33.000]   the people who've come through this podcast as guests,
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.200]   Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, yourself,
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:39.480]   Andy Galpin, who now has his own podcast,
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:40.320]   The Perform Podcast.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:42.480]   Like more and more discussions about strength
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.700]   and training for strength for the general public,
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:46.200]   not just people who want to be power lifters.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.720]   So I think there's a lot of carry over there.
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:50.560]   And I think the more that people hear us say
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.520]   that resistance training can be really powerful
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:56.120]   for health and longevity and getting strong
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.480]   is one of the best things you can do
[01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:59.040]   for your health and longevity,
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.440]   injury protection, et cetera.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:01.880]   Peter Ortega has talked about this
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:04.680]   and it's not just about building muscle.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:09.680]   Want to know how they should adjust their training,
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:12.740]   if at all, if they are 50 and older.
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:15.080]   So obviously one of the key things to getting
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:16.640]   and staying in great shape over time,
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:19.080]   I always say is avoid getting hurt.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:22.280]   Could we say, okay, don't try anything too novel
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.000]   and crazy without easing into it.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.680]   Could we also perhaps-
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:28.320]   - But I would say that goes for anybody, quite frankly.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.060]   - Okay, could we also say perhaps find the movements
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:33.560]   that you can do without injury
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.440]   and just keep doing those over and over?
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.880]   Is there any evidence that mixing up the exercises
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.440]   is important, meaning doing new movements?
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.040]   Or if you find two or three movements
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.780]   that work well for you, can you just stick with those
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.560]   and just work on progressive overload?
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:48.800]   - I think you can stick with those.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:50.920]   I think, you know, muscle,
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.280]   the whole concept of muscle confusion,
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:56.240]   muscle knows tension and how long it's under that tension
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:57.720]   and for how many sets it's under that tension.
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:00.640]   It doesn't, it's not like, well, this is a,
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:03.040]   I can tell that this is an incline bench press
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.320]   versus an incline dumbbell.
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.800]   I mean, you know, you might move
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.400]   through different ranges of motion and whatnot,
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.440]   but the tension on the muscle is the tension on the muscle.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.640]   So what I'd say to people is,
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:16.560]   I think most people probably change up things too much
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:21.560]   because there is like a neurological adaptation
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:25.120]   to doing a specific exercise where you get stronger at it.
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.480]   And so now you're using more load,
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:28.400]   you can create more mechanical tension.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.640]   But if you're always changing things up,
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.400]   you might not take advantage of that full, you know,
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.760]   kind of neurological adaptation.
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:39.800]   But if you're always doing the same exercises,
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:42.200]   it's too easy to get comfortable and fall into,
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:44.120]   well, did I do three sets of 10
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.840]   and I always do three sets of 10 and I use this weight?
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.120]   And that's what I do.
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.760]   And now you're no longer progressively overloading.
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:50.920]   So I think there has to be a balance
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:54.560]   between enough changing of exercises
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.400]   to kind of promote some novelty,
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:58.520]   because as you know, novelty,
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.480]   there's a reward center in the brain for that,
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.480]   just changing something.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.280]   And think about anytime you're gonna try a new workout,
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.040]   you get a little excited about it, you know?
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:08.960]   When I was gonna try Zach's way of training,
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:09.800]   you know, three years ago,
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.880]   I was like, oh, I was very, very excited about it, you know?
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:14.720]   So I think there is a place for that,
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.520]   but I think people tend to fall into a little bit too much
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:19.440]   of doing the same thing over and over
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:21.360]   or constantly changing things
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:23.400]   'cause they're always chasing that novelty.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.440]   And I think that the reality
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.440]   is probably somewhere in the middle,
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:29.040]   but specifically for over 50,
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:34.520]   I think whatever you can do with low pain level
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.420]   and be consistent with that you enjoy,
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:39.520]   that's what's best for you.
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.480]   I mean, I always tell the story,
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.040]   I had a client who, they loved CrossFit,
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.320]   they loved doing CrossFit.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:48.840]   And they said, you know, I wanna build muscle
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.960]   and I know it's not the best workout for building muscle.
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:53.240]   I said, it might be for you
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:55.720]   because if you hate bodybuilding training
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:57.640]   and you're not motivated to go do it
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:58.800]   and you don't enjoy it,
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:01.000]   you're probably not gonna work hard at it.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.480]   And so maybe for you a CrossFit workout
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.480]   is the best muscle building workout
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.000]   because if I try to get you to do something else,
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.360]   you'd hate it and would lose motivation.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:11.720]   - Right, and it feeds back to that consistency principle
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:13.080]   that you talked about before.
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:16.440]   - Exactly, so when we look at like,
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:17.800]   I think this might be interesting
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.760]   for some of your listeners.
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.120]   So when we look at how much muscle you can build
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:24.400]   after a certain age,
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.080]   you can build the same amount of muscle
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:30.760]   as a percentage of your starting skeletal muscle mass, okay?
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.280]   So what I mean by that is once you're 50, 60,
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.360]   you've usually lost some muscle, okay?
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.080]   And if you've never lifted before,
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:41.680]   if you go into lift, as a percentage basis,
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.520]   it appears that you will still gain
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:44.920]   the same amount of lean mass.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.400]   But for example, if somebody has 80 kilos
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:51.200]   of starting lean, most of your podcast listeners
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.080]   are USA, I assume.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.680]   So let's say somebody has 150 pounds of lean mass
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.800]   when they start, just throwing a random number,
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.560]   and they gain 10% over a couple of years.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:03.480]   Now they have 165 pounds of lean mass,
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:07.040]   they've gained 15 pounds, but the percentage is 10.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.660]   If somebody starts and they have 100 and say,
[02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:14.160]   20 pounds of lean mass, 10% of that is 12 pounds,
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.880]   they gained an absolute less amount,
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:20.640]   but as a percentage, it was similar or same.
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.280]   And we actually see that with women too.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.560]   Women actually develop as a percentage
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.400]   of their starting lean mass,
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.960]   the same percentage increase in lean mass as men
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.920]   when they do the same level of hard training.
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.040]   So what I tell people who are,
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.480]   I'll have people say, well, you know,
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:35.960]   I'm too old to start resistance.
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:40.960]   No, no, now is the perfect time to start, right now.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.120]   And honestly, it doesn't take a huge dose.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.040]   I mean, if you wanna be like, you know,
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.040]   get into powerlifting and like compete at competition,
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.760]   yeah, now it takes a bigger dose, right?
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:53.560]   But what it takes to get,
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:54.680]   and I'm just gonna throw a number out,
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:57.120]   80%, the majority of the benefits
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:59.720]   for health, strength, resistance training,
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:02.200]   you could probably get in three,
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.220]   four sessions of 30 to 40 minutes.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.960]   You know, you don't have to have a huge input of time.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.120]   And just look at the depression study we talked about.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:11.760]   Obviously that's not like muscle and strength,
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:14.720]   but two sessions of 25 minutes,
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.000]   I mean, it is a absurdly low dose that you require.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.400]   And I think a lot of people,
[02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:23.160]   I try to be careful about this too,
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.040]   we'll see how I train,
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.560]   which is two, three hours a day for five days a week,
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:29.960]   and think that's what's needed.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:30.800]   No, no, that's what,
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.920]   I wanna go win a world championship.
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:35.120]   That's what's needed for that.
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.540]   It's not needed for you to build muscle and get stronger.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:40.520]   And even when I was at grad school across the street,
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:44.960]   they did a study in frail elderly where they had them,
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.200]   basically they had trouble like standing up
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:48.040]   from a seated position.
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.800]   And by the end of a 12 week study of them,
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:51.280]   like progressively overloading them,
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.480]   which was basically like them just lowering the seat
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:54.920]   at first, right?
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:58.720]   And then maybe adding like a little bit of weight.
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:01.400]   They saw these people built muscle, built bone,
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:04.600]   got healthier, better quality of life.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:06.600]   And these are people in their seventies.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:07.920]   And there was a study in Australia
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.000]   that actually got on the news.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.880]   Peter Atiyah talked about it with elderly women
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:16.440]   who I think they were above age 70.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:17.880]   And there's some of them in there deadlifting
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:22.880]   like 150, like upper hundreds in deadlift, you know?
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:26.280]   It's incredible how,
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.680]   I took a class called
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.760]   Skeletal Muscle Structure, Function, and Plasticity.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:35.180]   Your skeletal muscle is so adaptable.
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:37.400]   It is such an adaptable tissue.
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:38.520]   It's amazing.
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:41.880]   The same thing that can allow somebody to squat,
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:43.600]   Jesus Oliveira, shout out.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:47.560]   Squat over a thousand pounds is the same tissue
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:50.560]   that can allow somebody to run a hundred miles
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.240]   like David Goggins.
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:53.080]   Think about that.
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:56.200]   That's really incredibly adaptive.
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:58.480]   And so what I'll tell the people,
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:00.640]   regardless of your age, your sex,
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:03.160]   whatever demographic you are in,
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:05.760]   resistance training for just a couple of times a week
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:07.780]   for a short period of time
[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:11.600]   will drastically improve the prospects
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:13.880]   of your quality of life, your longevity.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:16.760]   I mean, if we look at hand grip strength,
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:17.800]   we look at lean mass,
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:20.620]   they're all inversely associated with mortality,
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:22.080]   especially the older you get
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:24.480]   becomes a stronger association.
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:26.240]   And I always tell people, I'm like,
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:27.920]   it's not about the hand grip strength.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:30.920]   This is a proxy for just strength overall, right?
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.440]   There was a study where they looked at pushups
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:35.560]   and found pushups were inversely associated with mortality.
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.400]   It's not that doing pushups is magic.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.320]   It's that that is a proxy for that person being strong.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.400]   And we focus so much of our attention,
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.760]   especially like on falls in the elderly, right?
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:48.480]   Well, if they had more bone mass,
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.320]   they wouldn't break their bones.
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.080]   What if they didn't fall in the first place
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.040]   'cause they were strong enough
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:55.760]   and had good enough gait and balance to catch themselves?
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.080]   And oh, by the way,
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.000]   nothing better for increasing bone mass
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.680]   than resistance training.
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:02.520]   So I am a huge fan.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:04.840]   And then we already talked about like the metabolic,
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:06.400]   like skeletal muscle.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.400]   Gabrielle touched on it.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:08.880]   It was one of the first things Don Lehman said
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:09.720]   when I came in his lab.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:14.040]   He goes, "Skeletal muscle fits every definition of an organ.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.780]   "And we don't talk about it like an organ.
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:17.460]   "We talk about it like it's this inner tissue
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:20.100]   "that just sits there, and it is not.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.140]   "It sends out signals to other tissues.
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:24.020]   "It integrates signals from other tissues.
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:26.080]   "It is an endocrine organ."
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:31.280]   And so many people have unhealthy skeletal muscle.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:34.280]   And if we treat, and what happens when you resistance train?
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:37.060]   What happens when you build muscle?
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:39.040]   Muscle is a metabolic sink.
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:40.840]   It is greedy, right?
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.440]   It's sucking up.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.280]   It's incredible.
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:45.920]   You can take people who are type two diabetic,
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:47.760]   and if you get them on a slight calorie deficit,
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:49.800]   you get them to start exercising.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:52.600]   It is incredible how fast their blood markers
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:54.180]   will start to resolve.
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:55.700]   Like they can still be obese,
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:57.960]   and you'll see their blood markers start to resolve
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.160]   within, like you'll see improvements in weeks.
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:03.520]   Lehman did a, I wanna say a 16-week study
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:06.800]   in either diabetic or pre-diabetic women
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:09.800]   back in like 2003, I wanna say.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:11.200]   And he said within four weeks,
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:13.600]   he said we already saw these blood markers start to resolve.
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.760]   Like your HbA1c hasn't resolved,
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:17.520]   but a lot of these other markers started to resolve
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:21.820]   because at a fundamental level, at least in my opinion,
[02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:24.780]   and other metabolism people may disagree,
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:27.960]   I'm a big fan of Occam's razor,
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.960]   which is plainly stated, all things being equal,
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:36.080]   the simplest explanation is typically true.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.240]   The actual hardcore scientific definition
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:42.520]   is the hypothesis that requires
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:44.920]   the least amount of assumptions is usually true.
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.420]   You're putting in so much energy into a system,
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:51.820]   and you're running out of places to put it.
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:54.700]   So you have skeletal muscle mass, you have liver,
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.200]   these other tissues in the periphery,
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:58.280]   and then you have adipose tissue.
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.120]   And did you know they actually show people
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.640]   who have more adipocytes are actually more resistant
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:05.760]   to type two diabetes.
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.480]   So they have more smaller fat cells
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.600]   that can soak up more of this stuff.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.000]   And since type two diabetes
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.720]   is basically too much glucose in the blood, right?
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:19.540]   And a lack of insulin sensitivity,
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:24.000]   small adipocytes are more insulin sensitive.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.260]   And so what happens is we,
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:29.320]   at least in adipocyte physiology,
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.920]   we used to think of adipose as also an inert tissue.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.360]   And now we know that's not true either.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.880]   - And lots of different cell types.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:39.840]   We used to just think that there was brown, beige,
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.000]   and white fat cells, and subcutaneous, and intravisceral.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.000]   Now they've done sequencing of different white fat cells,
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.680]   and like 25, probably now 50 different,
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:54.960]   I mean, different genetics among those cells
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.920]   that respond differently to insulin.
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.640]   I mean, fat is a very interesting
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:01.240]   and heterogeneous tissue. - It's really interesting.
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:02.800]   But most fat cells,
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:04.400]   at least based on the literature I've read,
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.680]   and again, I'm happy to have somebody correct me
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:06.520]   who's an expert in this,
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:09.380]   but they can expand to a certain point
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:12.560]   where it really becomes difficult for them to get bigger.
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:13.680]   The integrity of the cell,
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:15.320]   'cause you still got a cell wall,
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.960]   you have a plasma membrane and everything,
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.720]   and you have an extracellular matrix
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:22.680]   that is scaffolding this fat tissue onto your body.
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:25.340]   And so at a certain size of adipocyte,
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:27.600]   it basically becomes,
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.920]   you just can't pack any more in there, okay?
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.520]   And so if you can't put any more in muscle,
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:34.700]   because muscle isn't, you're not active,
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:39.320]   and muscle's not moving and churning through substrate,
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.600]   and you can't pack any more into adipose,
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.440]   where does it wind up?
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:45.080]   It's in your blood.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:47.520]   You can't get, and now when your blood levels,
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.040]   it's interesting because there are some people
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:49.880]   who have all these theories,
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:52.040]   but like one person, a researcher, was like,
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:53.800]   well, I think branched-chain amino acids
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:55.120]   actually cause insulin resistance,
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.280]   'cause we see them elevated in the blood
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.160]   in type 2 diabetes.
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:00.280]   And I was actually in a,
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:03.040]   it was in a, I was a grad student
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.200]   watching this person present,
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.160]   and I put my hand up, I said,
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.600]   isn't everything elevated in the blood in type 2 diabetes?
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:12.200]   You know, why are we picking on branched-chain amino acids?
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.280]   So you do have some people
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.040]   who too can become type 2 diabetic who aren't obese.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:22.220]   They tend to have not as many fat cells,
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:25.160]   which sounds like it'd be an advantage.
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:27.240]   And if you're lean, or sorry,
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:30.440]   if you are not overeating, right,
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.260]   and getting enough exercise in,
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:33.560]   it probably is an advantage
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:35.520]   because you have less overall fat mass.
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.080]   But you are going to reach that critical mass
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.680]   of an adipocyte of about 100 microns, I think it is,
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:45.160]   faster because your overall fat cell number.
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.080]   So at the same fat mass,
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:48.520]   your fat cells are bigger,
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:52.220]   and bigger fat cells are less insulin-sensitive.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:54.720]   In fact, one of the treatments for type 2 diabetes,
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.040]   sulfonylureas, I think they're called,
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:12:59.680]   they're PPAR gamma agonists.
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:01.520]   They actually increase the production of fat cells.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:03.840]   They create new, small fat cells.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:05.640]   Now you have a place to put stuff,
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:08.400]   and you lower your blood glucose.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.720]   So very-- - It's a reservoir.
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:14.560]   - Exactly, and I'm overgeneralizing, to be sure.
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:17.380]   And again, I hope if I've butchered anything,
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:18.680]   somebody will come in and correct me.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:19.520]   - They will.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.360]   - But what's amazing is this stuff in the blood,
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:28.500]   you just gotta get stuff moving.
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.900]   Like, 'cause you start doing exercise,
[02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:34.360]   start controlling your calories a little bit, guess what?
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:36.680]   You're oxidizing things to the Krebs cycle.
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:39.260]   You're going through glycolysis.
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:41.220]   You can now start to pull things in, right?
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:42.780]   You're using this substrate.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:43.980]   You can start to pull things in.
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:46.140]   And because you're pulling things in,
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:48.720]   now adipose can start to release
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:51.580]   some of its free fatty acids into the blood,
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:54.140]   or some of its triacylglycerides into free fatty acids
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:57.560]   into the bloodstream, which can also facilitate this.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.560]   So using muscle, you are, it is a partitioning effect,
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:08.900]   and it doesn't take long to start lowering this glucose,
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:11.100]   blood lipids, these things in the blood.
[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:15.260]   It can actually resolve, you know, at least those markers
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:16.740]   can start resolving themselves pretty quickly,
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:19.880]   which is why, you know, when we look at weight loss,
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:22.100]   what level of weight loss they say is clinically relevant,
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:24.120]   it's only 5%, right?
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:27.080]   Which you'll have obese people,
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:28.680]   and they'll say, well, 5% weight loss,
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:32.240]   you see these big benefits in like blood lipids
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.280]   and metabolic health.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:36.680]   You wouldn't think with just 5% weight loss
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.800]   you would get that, but you do,
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:43.800]   because you're just giving a little bit of space
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.080]   to get that stuff in the blood out.
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:48.180]   Now, again, this is my, I want to be very clear.
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.820]   This is not a proven thing.
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:55.700]   I feel pretty strongly that this explains a lot,
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:58.680]   but again, this is my personal opinion
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:00.980]   about how these diseases develop and whatnot.
[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:03.220]   But it is, I think it's relatively simple.
[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:06.340]   - Yeah, using, thinking about muscle as an organ,
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:07.760]   thinking about feeding muscle,
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.260]   we talked about that earlier,
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:10.580]   thinking about moving muscle,
[02:15:10.580 --> 02:15:12.140]   and in particular training for strength,
[02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:13.780]   resistance training of different kinds,
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:16.140]   hypertrophy, yes, but I, you know,
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:18.900]   I'm kind of given a little bit of a biased vote
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:21.580]   for more strength training out there across the population
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.820]   for really for the longevity reasons.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:25.460]   I mean, Peter Atiyah has pointed out
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:30.460]   that the percentage of people who die after a fall,
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:32.300]   not because of the fall itself,
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:35.300]   but because of a hip injury or a wrist injury,
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:37.980]   and then they go immobile,
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:39.900]   or they're just not exercising as much anymore,
[02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:42.060]   then they get an infection, and then it cascades.
[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:43.020]   In fact, I had a conversation
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:45.680]   with one of my parents recently on their 79th birthday.
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.740]   I said, you know, in the next five, 10 years,
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:54.100]   your biggest risk is probably going to be going downstairs
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:56.980]   or stepping off a curb, not going up,
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:58.940]   but as Peter's pointed out, going down.
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:01.060]   So that eccentric movement, you know,
[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:02.820]   being able to sustain a fall,
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:05.460]   being able to not fall, to catch yourself, so to speak.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:07.620]   - Well, and practically you fall farther going downstairs
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:08.580]   than you do going upstairs. - Right, than going up.
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:11.700]   Exactly, and that pattern of falling while going down
[02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:15.740]   precedes a lot of infections that end up deadly, right?
[02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:19.100]   So, and, you know, hats off to Peter
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:20.420]   for really pointing out the relationship
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:21.260]   between those things,
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:23.580]   and to you for encouraging people to strength train.
[02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:25.580]   Also, I love the idea that I don't have to go to failure
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:27.240]   if I'm in strength training, 'cause I like training heavy,
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:28.940]   but the training to the point
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:30.660]   where the muscles are quaking,
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:33.540]   even though that's how I initially started training,
[02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:37.040]   'cause I came up in the Mike Mentzer camp,
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:40.220]   I actually find that it eats into my recovery
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:43.040]   in a way that maybe is a little more subtle,
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:44.820]   but meaningful nonetheless,
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:47.380]   which is that I feel fatigued later in the day.
[02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:48.980]   Whereas if I complete a training session
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:50.460]   where I can complete every rep,
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:53.880]   I notice I don't get into that quaking thing.
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.780]   I actually have a lot of mental and physical energy
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:56.660]   later in the day.
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:58.420]   - And it's psychologically and emotionally fatiguing
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:16:59.260]   as well.
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.740]   - Maybe this one could be out of a brief answer,
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:03.580]   or maybe not, I don't know.
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:06.480]   Are there true age-related changes in metabolism
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:10.300]   that are independent of decline in muscle mass?
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:12.580]   I saw a paper, I think it was published in "Science"
[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:14.460]   a few years ago that said that metabolism
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.060]   actually doesn't slow that much as we age.
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:18.300]   Of course, total muscle mass-
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:19.340]   - So you mean BMR?
[02:17:19.340 --> 02:17:21.420]   - BMR, basal metabolic rate.
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:23.920]   In general, well, I should just say,
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:25.460]   up until that paper came out, I thought,
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:28.260]   okay, as we get older, our "metabolism slows."
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:30.140]   Then of course, we have to remember that puberty
[02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:32.660]   and childhood is sort of like being on
[02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:35.140]   performance-enhancing drugs in the sense that
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:38.840]   protein synthesis is just massive and ongoing.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:41.960]   But let's just say from age 30 onward,
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.480]   let's say between 30 and 80,
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.820]   assuming that somebody's doing things
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:48.640]   to maintain muscle mass,
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:50.280]   is there any reason to believe that
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.620]   their basal metabolic rate actually goes down
[02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:54.420]   just as a function of age?
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:57.080]   - Yeah, you're citing the work from Herman Ponser
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:00.000]   and really great lab-looking energy expenditure
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.700]   that he does a lot of great stuff.
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:06.160]   And so that study was looking at several thousand people,
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:08.700]   I think, looking at their total daily energy expenditure
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:10.340]   and really found it's pretty flat
[02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:12.220]   from like age 20 to age 70.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:14.000]   And then it kind of starts to go down,
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.740]   but you can tie it to the loss of lean mass.
[02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:18.940]   And same thing for basal metabolic rate
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:20.760]   when they do indirect calimetry.
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:27.500]   If you look at, and this goes for older people,
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:29.180]   also women versus men,
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:32.580]   and then also type two diabetics
[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:33.960]   versus non-type two diabetics,
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:36.060]   obese versus non-obese,
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:40.920]   80, I think the number is like over 80% of the variance
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:44.420]   in BMR is completely explained by the lean mass,
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:46.320]   by the amount of lean mass somebody has.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:49.240]   And by the way, the last 20% probably is explained
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:50.900]   by where that lean mass occurs.
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:52.720]   Because liver, for example,
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:55.120]   is a more metabolically active tissue gram per gram
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:57.120]   than pretty much any other tissue.
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:59.980]   The skeletal muscle is more metabolically active
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:02.060]   than fat tissue,
[02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:03.980]   but for a lean tissue is actually
[02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:06.100]   somewhat like metabolically slow
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:08.900]   because it's turnover rate is only like 1% to 2% per day.
[02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:10.020]   - You just have a lot of it.
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:10.860]   - Yeah, right, right.
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:12.940]   But on an absolute amount of calories you burn,
[02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:13.780]   you burn a lot in muscle
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:15.380]   because you have so much of it.
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:16.220]   Great point.
[02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:21.260]   So things like gut, liver tissues per gram of tissue
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:23.060]   are very active.
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:26.860]   So yeah, just doesn't seem to be,
[02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:29.200]   for a long time, we spent so much time
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:30.920]   focused on the metabolism side of things
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:31.960]   when we're looking at aging,
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:34.480]   when we're looking at obesity,
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:37.040]   and we just didn't really find impressive stuff.
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:40.520]   So obese people don't have slower metabolisms on average.
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:45.240]   The research shows that actually on an absolute basis,
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.920]   they're faster than people who are normal weight.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:50.240]   When you standardize for lean mass,
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:52.360]   it ends up being about the same.
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:54.840]   People who are type two diabetic, same thing.
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:56.280]   When you standardize for lean mass,
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:59.360]   if anything, they have a little bit faster BMR.
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:00.920]   And so if you think about it,
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:02.200]   it actually kind of makes a little bit of sense
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:03.080]   on a biochemical level
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:04.600]   because if you're insulin resistant,
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:07.280]   you're also insulin resistant in fat tissue, right?
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:10.320]   So like, okay, so it makes sense
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:13.040]   that maybe you waste some more energy
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.420]   because you're not able to put it
[02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:15.920]   where you wanna put it, right?
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:22.160]   So the people get upset about this
[02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:25.880]   because like, oh no, it's gotta be metabolism, metabolism.
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:30.880]   And then GLP-1 memetics have really kind of shown,
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:33.520]   no, the answer to this question
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:36.640]   is very much on the appetite side of things.
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:39.560]   It's like, we tried to make a bunch of different drugs
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:40.760]   that would increase metabolism.
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:43.320]   We tried to do all these things to increase metabolism
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:45.960]   and nothing seemed to really make a big difference.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:47.280]   And then we came out with the most powerful
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:49.380]   appetite suppressants in the history of mankind
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:52.400]   and people are losing large amounts of weight
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:53.800]   and keeping it off.
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:58.280]   So I think people got too focused on that metabolism side
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:02.800]   or what I hear a lot of is from like post-menopausal women,
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:05.780]   I'll hear somebody say, my metabolism dropped.
[02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:10.880]   What probably happened, you're sleeping less,
[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:13.000]   you're more stressed, you don't feel as good
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.800]   because the hormonal changes, you don't feel as good.
[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:18.220]   And so you spontaneously became less physically active
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.160]   and didn't realize it because our NEAT,
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:22.160]   like our non-exercise activity thermogenesis,
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:24.880]   our non-purposeful physical activity that we do,
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:28.040]   fidgeting, pacing, is actually a large portion
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:30.000]   of our daily energy expenditure.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.440]   And people get this wrong.
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:35.120]   You can't make yourself do more NEAT
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:36.680]   because then it's just exercise.
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:38.080]   If you're purposely doing it, it's exercise.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:39.240]   - Bouncing your knee.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:41.040]   - It's all subconscious, right?
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.760]   But if you're not sleeping as well
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.880]   and you're feeling worse, spontaneously,
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.480]   you'll just not move as much.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:49.680]   And I know that people, that feels like there's a lot
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:51.880]   of judgment and shame associated with that,
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:53.440]   but it is the truth.
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:57.160]   It is a practical limitation and it may not be metabolism.
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:59.040]   I guess I'm a little bit pedantic with that,
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:02.520]   but it still contributes to your overall energy expenditure.
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:07.520]   And so again, they've looked at this and I mean,
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.880]   there is some evidence that like if your estrogen drops
[02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:11.840]   and you replace that with supplemental estrogen,
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:15.000]   that that can like help out with like maybe 50 to 100 calorie
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.240]   energy expenditure per day.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.320]   So if you're replacing something
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:19.480]   that's like now clinically low.
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.640]   But my guess is that it would also drive more activity,
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:23.880]   feeling better, more activity,
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:25.720]   sleeping better, more activity.
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:28.760]   - And that's where it's hard to disconnect that, right?
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:31.480]   So yeah, I think metabolism wise,
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:33.360]   the results ended up being pretty underwhelming
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:35.160]   for all this stuff that we just assumed,
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:36.920]   well, if somebody's overweight,
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:38.800]   it's 'cause there's low metabolism.
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:41.080]   The research didn't pan that out,
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:42.960]   but I still think it was very interesting.
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:45.520]   And again, it speaks to like the power of the mind
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:46.880]   and the connection in the mind
[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:49.720]   of how some of these drugs act.
[02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:51.640]   But I do tell people when they say,
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:54.320]   well, calorie deficit didn't work for me.
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:57.360]   And obviously my metabolism was messed up
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:59.840]   'cause I had to get on Ozempic to lose weight.
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:03.600]   I'm like, well, it doesn't really do anything
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:07.120]   to metabolism like the speed of your metabolism.
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:10.000]   What happened is you just,
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.600]   you no longer mindlessly snack.
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:17.600]   You feel, you are now in touch with your satiety signals
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:23.120]   and that's why you're losing weight.
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.960]   And that's why these drugs, they work.
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:30.800]   - All right, so speaking of Ozempic, Munjaro and similar,
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:33.880]   let's talk about these drugs that are reducing appetite.
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.120]   And in fairness have allowed millions of people
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:41.720]   to lose substantial amounts of weight and keep it off.
[02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:46.360]   This topic tends to get people a little bit riled up
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:49.120]   on social media, because I think for some reason,
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:53.320]   people believe that if one gives these drugs the nod,
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:56.000]   you're essentially saying you don't need to exercise.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.640]   But I didn't see anywhere or hear anywhere
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:02.720]   that the use of any compound, drug or otherwise,
[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:05.080]   is mutually exclusive with taking good care of oneself
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:05.920]   in other ways too.
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.440]   So what are your thoughts on these compounds
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:09.080]   and what you're seeing out there?
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.840]   - I think my take is pretty balanced on this,
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:14.000]   which is I think they appear to be great tools
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.560]   for people reducing their intake and reducing body fat.
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:19.240]   And it functions through appetite.
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:22.520]   I mean, these drugs are GLP-1 mimetics.
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:26.040]   And so GLP-1 is a hormone secreted by the gut
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:27.400]   in response to feeding.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:30.640]   And it acts on the gut as well as the brain
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:35.640]   to reduce appetite, slow motility.
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.560]   So it's a satiety hormone essentially.
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:41.640]   Now it has a very short half-life in the body.
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:43.320]   So the reason a lot of people will come out and say,
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:44.880]   "Well, there's things you can do naturally
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.880]   to increase your GLP-1."
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.400]   This is like talking about, I mean,
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.240]   yes, a BB gun fires a projectile
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:52.720]   and a tank fires a projectile,
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:55.400]   but there's a pretty big difference, right?
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:59.640]   So with GLP-1 mimetics, what's happening is
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:02.780]   they're taking that protein and changing out
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:06.000]   some of the amino acids in that protein.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.200]   And it basically just gives a much longer half-life.
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:09.840]   That's why people can take it once a week
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:10.680]   or whatever it is,
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:12.320]   'cause it just stays around much longer.
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:16.080]   And so if you think about the food environment we live in,
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.480]   which is free access to cheap, hyperpalatable foods,
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.920]   our brains for the most part are probably not equipped
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:27.520]   to regulate appetite in that environment.
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:30.660]   And it really actually is kind of incredible
[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:32.840]   how resilient the human body is,
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:35.360]   because if you look at when the obesity crisis started,
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.280]   we already had ultra-processed foods available.
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:40.360]   We had cakes, cookies, all these sorts of things,
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:42.720]   but the difference was
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:46.560]   you had to go to the bakery and get it,
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:51.440]   or there had to be some small barrier, right?
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.480]   And then, I think kind of the barrier that got flipped
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:59.760]   was basically now, in the last 30 years,
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:03.240]   you can go anywhere and get access to cheap,
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:06.080]   ultra-processed, hyperpalatable, calorically-dense foods.
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:10.160]   And they just don't have the same effect on satiety
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:11.200]   that normal food does,
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:14.120]   where, like I have a Kevin Hall study at NIH
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:17.520]   where they took people from a minimally-processed diet
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:20.040]   and switched them to an ultra-processed diet,
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:22.200]   and they spontaneously increased their caloric intake
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:24.840]   by 500 calories a day, like overnight.
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:28.480]   That may sound like not a big deal to some people listening.
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:30.880]   That is a very big deal.
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.240]   - It's about a pound per week of increase in body weight.
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:35.720]   - Yeah, I mean-- - Assuming.
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:38.000]   - Assuming that there's no increase in energy expenditure,
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.160]   which we know happens over time.
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:43.440]   But with these GLP-1 memetics,
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.380]   they're slowing down motility,
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:46.680]   they're acting on the hypothalamus,
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.480]   they're reducing appetite, and it's a very powerful effect.
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:53.320]   Now, some of the side effects are nausea.
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:56.200]   Some people reported kind of like a, not freezing,
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.920]   but like too slow motility, essentially.
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:01.360]   So there's some GI side effects,
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:03.760]   which are kind of to be expected with something like this.
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.080]   And on one side, you've got,
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:09.640]   it's so funny how everything gets politicized these days,
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:10.880]   but on one side, you've got people saying,
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:13.640]   oh, these drugs have no side effects whatsoever,
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.600]   and heck, I think everybody should be on GLP-1s
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:19.800]   because we're not made to live in this food environment.
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:22.400]   And then on the other side, you've got people saying,
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.000]   well, this just obliterates the need for hard work,
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.560]   and these people don't take accountability,
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:28.520]   and I don't really think either of those messages
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:29.360]   are really useful.
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.280]   I think there's a lot of nuance here.
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:34.280]   And I mean, it's a drug, and every drug
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:35.320]   is gonna have side effects,
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:37.960]   some worse than others for different people.
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:39.320]   And so for some people,
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:40.560]   it's not gonna make sense to take it
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:42.640]   based on their lifestyle and side effects they get.
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:45.320]   But for other people, I did a post on this
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.320]   where I talked about how much weight people lose on average,
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.640]   and so many people in the comments said,
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:54.640]   I've lost 100 pounds, or I've lost 80 pounds,
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:55.720]   or whatever it is.
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:56.960]   - Taking Monjaro or something.
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:58.600]   - Yeah, one of these GLP-1 memetics.
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:01.880]   And again, going back to our conversation of big rocks,
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:06.440]   people worry about lean mass loss,
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:09.600]   they worry about, there was a study in, I think, rodents,
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.720]   where they saw an increase in thyroid,
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:13.720]   I wanna say thyroid cancer or something like that,
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:16.040]   but it was not really a physiological dose,
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:17.500]   and again, it's rodents.
[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:20.800]   People say, well, we don't know
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:22.800]   what the long-term effects of these drugs are.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:26.900]   Well, they've actually been around for diabetes treatment
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:28.680]   for a couple of decades now.
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:32.720]   But, I mean, do we know what they do in 50 years?
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:35.640]   I guess not, but we know what obesity does.
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:38.120]   So I'm gonna take Ron White's line,
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:40.060]   which is shoot the alligator closest to the boat.
[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:43.200]   I think if somebody's very overweight or obese,
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:44.800]   and they've tried a bunch of different methods,
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.880]   and people say, well, they just haven't been consistent.
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:50.680]   Okay, so we can live in fantasy land,
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.240]   or we can live in the real world,
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:54.160]   which is maybe some people just need
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:56.540]   some more training wheels than other people, okay?
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.320]   If we could stop putting an ethical judgment
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:03.280]   on how easy or hard it is
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:05.600]   for certain people to do certain things.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.820]   I mean, it's easy for me to say just be consistent
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:13.120]   because nutrition has never been a problem for me.
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:14.920]   I've never struggled with my weight,
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:18.440]   but I struggled in other areas of my life
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.580]   that why can't I just be more consistent?
[02:29:21.580 --> 02:29:24.320]   Why can't I just do the things I know I need to do?
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:26.600]   I'm sure you would feel the same way
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:28.060]   about certain things in your life where it's like,
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:29.300]   well, I know logically what to do,
[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:31.580]   but it's hard for me to do it, right?
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:35.540]   And so if we look at the burden
[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:38.100]   on the healthcare system of obesity
[02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:39.820]   and these type two diabetes,
[02:29:39.820 --> 02:29:42.660]   and then all the metabolic diseases associated with them,
[02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:46.180]   it's hard for me to imagine a scenario
[02:29:46.180 --> 02:29:49.020]   where this is not a big net positive, to be quite frank.
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:53.820]   Now, I wanna, this is, as my friend John Deloney says,
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.600]   it's both and, okay?
[02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:59.760]   Some people, this is really gonna help them,
[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:02.020]   and it should be done in concert with lifestyle changes
[02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:03.600]   and lifestyle education,
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:05.440]   because we don't want people to go
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:06.880]   from eating a lot of a crappy diet
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:08.960]   to a little of a crappy diet, right?
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:11.680]   We want them to make better choices overall.
[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:14.060]   But sometimes, again, habit coupling,
[02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:18.200]   people don't get motivated and then get results.
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:21.360]   People start getting results and then get motivated, right?
[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:25.260]   And so a lot of times, people will start losing weight,
[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:27.340]   and now they're motivated to go to the gym.
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:28.900]   They're motivated to eat better.
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:32.100]   It's, it is, it doesn't happen in a linear path.
[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:35.820]   These things are kind of like, you know,
[02:30:35.820 --> 02:30:37.620]   like the opposite of a vicious cycle,
[02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:39.940]   where this is, you're getting into a good cycle, right?
[02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:43.340]   And a lot of people tend to fall into these categories
[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:45.780]   where when things go bad, they go really bad,
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:46.780]   'cause it's a vicious cycle.
[02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:48.100]   When things go well, they go really well,
[02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:50.200]   'cause it's a good cycle.
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:53.660]   And so what I would say is with the concerns about GLP-1s,
[02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:56.360]   the one I hear most is loss of lean mass.
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:31:00.180]   So in studies, people who use GLP-1 medics,
[02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:04.440]   they lose like 30 to 40% of the weight from lean mass,
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:06.240]   which is a concern.
[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:09.300]   But by the way, that is similar to the amount of weight
[02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:10.900]   from lean mass people use
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:13.660]   who diet without resistance training or exercise.
[02:31:13.660 --> 02:31:17.700]   So I don't think that it's a unique problem to GLP-1s.
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:22.060]   My guess is when we start getting studies
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:24.780]   that combine exercise with GLP-1s
[02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:27.860]   and look at lean mass retention,
[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:29.380]   we'll probably see pretty similar results.
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:31.260]   So I'm not super worried about that.
[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:33.320]   On a practical level, I can see some concern with it,
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:35.080]   because if you don't have much appetite,
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:37.140]   you're usually not selecting protein
[02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:41.460]   as kind of your first line of what you're gonna pick.
[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:45.460]   And additionally, fiber,
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.200]   you're not usually gonna select as your first.
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:52.200]   So I think, again, these are great kind of like,
[02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:54.540]   if we think about like training wheels,
[02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:56.820]   I think these are great training wheels for people.
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:32:00.620]   And through natural, just having less appetite,
[02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:04.100]   people start controlling their intake better,
[02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:05.320]   and then all these other habits
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:07.780]   start to fall into place for some people.
[02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:12.700]   And I talked to a friend who, she's a nurse practitioner,
[02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:17.700]   and she tried a GLP-1 mimetic,
[02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:18.880]   just 'cause she's like,
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:20.960]   "I'm a nurse, I wanna see what this stuff is like for me."
[02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:24.520]   And then she talked to a lot of her clients.
[02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:28.500]   And the anecdotal feedback that popped up a lot was,
[02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:32.740]   it stopped the food noise in my head.
[02:32:32.740 --> 02:32:34.980]   I wasn't thinking about food all the time.
[02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:37.720]   I just stopped thinking about it so much.
[02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:40.160]   And if you look at obesity, I mean, again,
[02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:41.760]   it really is on the appetite side.
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:44.820]   We know that obese people have lower sensitivity
[02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:46.440]   to satiety signals.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:49.140]   They get a greater reward from food.
[02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:50.600]   Like I just posted about a study the other day
[02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:53.120]   where they gave a milkshake to people,
[02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:55.720]   and they didn't really see a dopamine response.
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:59.600]   And, but in people with binge eating disorder,
[02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:00.640]   when they give something like that,
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:02.200]   they do see a dopamine response.
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.800]   So a lot of it is contextual, right?
[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:08.360]   And so I think a lot of it's contextual around obesity
[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:12.080]   of, okay, these are people who get a greater reward
[02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:13.400]   from food on average.
[02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:16.040]   They're thinking about food more often.
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:18.920]   They've probably also dealt with people telling them
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:20.620]   in their entire life or however long
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:21.600]   that they need to lose weight.
[02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:24.140]   And so food is always on their mind
[02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:25.280]   in one thing or another.
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:28.440]   It's kind of like in "Ghostbusters" where they say,
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:29.900]   don't think about anything bad.
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:30.740]   What's the first thing you're gonna do?
[02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:32.680]   You're gonna think about something bad, right?
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:36.440]   And so trying to calm down food noise
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.760]   while knowing that you need to eat less food
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:40.360]   is probably pretty difficult.
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:45.360]   So on the whole, I think these drugs are positives.
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:48.280]   I think it's gonna lower the healthcare burden.
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:50.560]   And I think it's gonna help a lot of people.
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:51.800]   And the other thing I'll say is like,
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:53.640]   there's been a lot of pushback in the fitness industry
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:55.960]   by fitness influencers.
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:57.320]   - Why do you think that is?
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:00.480]   Like, as if it's gonna take their jobs away.
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:02.440]   It's like the same way that people fear AI.
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:05.200]   Like it somehow get like, like this stuff is here to stay.
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:06.480]   It benefits many, many people.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:11.360]   I feel this way about these GLP-1 mimetics and I,
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:12.720]   mimetics, excuse me.
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:14.360]   And I feel the same way about AI.
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:15.720]   It's like these things could be,
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:20.560]   yes, potentially used for evil, but you know, also for good.
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:22.840]   - If I think back about when I might've had
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:24.880]   that sort of reaction, I was in my early twenties.
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:28.160]   And that's when I thought obesity was a choice.
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:30.880]   I still think there is personal responsibility
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:32.120]   involved in obesity.
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:38.240]   But I think my feelings about obesity at that time
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:43.240]   were, if somebody's obese, they're making the choice.
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:47.240]   They don't care about the stuff they eat
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:52.240]   that mindfully they are choosing to eat these foods
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:54.280]   knowing this is gonna be the outcome.
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:55.360]   - Like self-inflicted.
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:56.200]   - Yeah.
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:58.240]   And I don't think that's the case at all.
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.000]   I think a lot of people's habits and behaviors
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.120]   are on autopilot, you know?
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:05.240]   I can remember very clearly,
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:07.480]   I dropped my kids off at school one day.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:10.280]   I stopped at 7-Eleven to fill up with gas
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:13.000]   and like grab something from the store, a drink.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:13.920]   And there was somebody,
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:15.560]   there was a obese woman in front of me
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:19.200]   and she was getting two slices of pizza at 8 a.m.
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:21.640]   And at first I kind of had that knee-jerk response
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:23.880]   of, oh, she's so lazy, of course she'll.
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:26.440]   And then I thought, you know what?
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:29.120]   This is probably something she's done for a long time.
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:31.720]   This is probably a very habit where she goes to 7-Eleven,
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:32.560]   she gets pizza.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:35.680]   Or on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. she's around this area
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:38.280]   and she goes to 7-Eleven and gets pizza.
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:39.120]   And maybe not,
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.080]   but I think a lot of people out there are like that
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:42.480]   where their habits and behaviors
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:43.720]   are very much on autopilot.
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.400]   It's not this mindfulness that we think they're doing.
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:52.240]   And that translates into other areas.
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:55.320]   And the other thing I realized is I'm like,
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:57.760]   it can't be laziness, like all of it,
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:01.200]   because there's obese people who are very successful
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:02.440]   in other areas of their life.
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:04.400]   So they don't want to work hard.
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:07.280]   And so, at least not for everybody,
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:08.600]   that can't be the explanation.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:11.000]   And I think with fitness influencers
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.320]   or people who have, you know, they've worked hard,
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:15.680]   they've built a good physique.
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:19.440]   It's almost like, how dare you get results
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:22.360]   without doing it yourself?
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:25.320]   I did this without any help, you know?
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:27.960]   And the reality is you might've had help
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:32.360]   because your upbringing might have not been food focused.
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:33.840]   You might not have had a mother
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:35.760]   who was always on you about food,
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.200]   or you might not have had parents who shamed you
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.680]   if you didn't clean your plate.
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:43.840]   You might've had genetics that made you more sensitive
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.680]   to satiety signals.
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:47.200]   You might've had a phenotype where if you overeat,
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.160]   you tend to just become spontaneously more active.
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:51.560]   That's part of the obese resistant phenotype.
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:53.640]   And so you might've had an advantage
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:55.040]   and you just didn't realize it.
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:56.960]   So I think if we could just get away
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:59.120]   from the judgment of stuff and look at,
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:03.160]   take the judgment, all that stuff out of it.
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:05.040]   Does this seem to help people?
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:08.280]   And is it gonna be a net positive on society?
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:10.960]   Thomas Sowell said, in order to make compassionate policy,
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:14.240]   you have to have dispassionate analysis of the data.
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:17.920]   And the data says this is gonna be massive for our society,
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:19.920]   and it's a huge benefit.
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:23.000]   So regardless of my personal feelings of,
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.400]   "Hey, somebody should be able, look at Ethan Suplee,
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:28.400]   lost 300 pounds doing it through all hard work and exercise."
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.320]   I'm pretty sure I've talked to Ethan about this
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:34.960]   and he said, "I think this is great."
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:39.800]   Because it's hard to get people to believe
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:42.720]   if people believe what they can see.
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:47.720]   And so if they start seeing results, then they can buy in.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:52.640]   And yeah, I think overall it's a net positive.
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:56.080]   So, I mean, maybe studies will come out in 10 years
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:57.960]   and people are falling over dead from this stuff
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.400]   and we'll say, "Oh, whoopsies."
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:02.560]   But I mean, you have to shoot the alligator closest
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:05.040]   to the boat and right now the biggest burden
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.440]   on our healthcare system,
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.560]   I think I'm correct in saying this,
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:12.360]   and the biggest threat in a lot of ways
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.320]   is how metabolically unhealthy our society is getting.
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:19.400]   - Yeah, I think also when people hear about these drugs,
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:22.200]   they think about the person who's slightly overweight
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:25.600]   or who is already fit, who wants to be even thinner.
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:27.880]   And that's not what we're talking about here.
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:32.080]   And I have a good friend who is an air traffic controller.
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.280]   He works very, very hard, very stressful job, obviously,
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:40.080]   high consequence job, and he's very overweight.
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:44.600]   He's gotta be more than 300 pounds by a significant margin.
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.680]   And he's really struggled over the years.
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:48.520]   And for years he talked about getting his,
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:49.760]   quote unquote, "stomach stapled."
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:52.240]   You know, that's sometimes referred to that way.
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:53.800]   Couldn't afford the surgery, this sort of thing.
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:54.640]   And I asked him about it.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.320]   I was like, "What's that about?"
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.400]   He's like, "I just need something that's gonna allow me
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.560]   "to move without pain or a little bit less pain."
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:04.920]   Every time he tries exercising, he injures himself.
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:06.720]   And he's probably going about that incorrectly,
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:09.120]   but he doesn't have a lot of time.
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:11.980]   And he literally has lives in his hands.
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:14.000]   He's married now, he may have kids soon.
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.720]   So I haven't spoken to him recently about these drugs,
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:19.040]   but to me, it seems like that's the perfect candidate
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:20.000]   for these drugs.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.000]   If he could eat less with more ease and lose some weight,
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.280]   and then also start exercising,
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:28.920]   I think that'd be a significant win for him.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:31.360]   So scenarios like that are what I think of.
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:34.100]   And then also, you know, it's a mostly free world
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:37.040]   in many places, not all.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:38.680]   So if people can afford these things
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:39.520]   and they wanna take them,
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:41.280]   like who am I to say they shouldn't take them?
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:45.040]   You know, I feel like the amount of judgment involved
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:47.680]   to say that somebody should or should not use a drug
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:51.120]   is that's safe and potentially helpful for them
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:56.120]   is like kind of, I mean, that's almost offensive in a way.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:58.200]   - Yeah, I mean, if you had something that,
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:00.920]   like if we came out with a drug and it's like,
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:02.560]   it looks like for a lot of people,
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:05.760]   this can fix opioid addiction, right?
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:06.600]   - Yeah, you'd give them that drug.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:10.060]   - We'd be shouting from the rooftops and celebrating, right?
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:11.520]   We wouldn't say, well, you just gotta gut it out
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:12.360]   and work harder.
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:14.200]   You know, you just gotta want it more.
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:16.280]   It's like, no, like there's some,
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:19.200]   yeah, there is some personal responsibility there
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:22.280]   and there are choices and things that can be made,
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:24.200]   but why are we trying to make this barrier
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:25.240]   so high for people?
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:26.880]   Like, let's lower this barrier.
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:27.720]   - I love that.
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:30.000]   On the other side of the coin,
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.080]   you've been pretty vocal elsewhere
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:38.080]   about the fact that sugar is not a drug, you know,
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:40.800]   because sometimes people will say, you know,
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.640]   sugar is a drug.
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.480]   I would sort of put in the soft argument for my side,
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:48.640]   soft argument that highly processed foods,
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:53.160]   or let's just call them high density of taste foods, right?
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:56.200]   That combine, you know, processed carbohydrates and fats,
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:40:59.000]   you know, at high heats that can be consumed in, you know,
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.360]   where you can easily consume several thousand calories,
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:04.520]   you know, almost unconsciously, right?
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:06.720]   I mean, unless you're asleep or in a coma,
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:09.160]   you can just pop these things in your mouth and keep going.
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:10.260]   I don't even know if they taste that good,
[02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:11.640]   but people just keep going.
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:14.040]   That there's a bit of kind of lack of awareness
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:15.840]   and compulsivity to them.
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:17.920]   Very different than addiction, of course,
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.280]   because people aren't necessarily going out
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:21.760]   and robbing people.
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:26.760]   But maybe just touch on your view of sugar as a substance.
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:29.360]   We're not talking about the sugar in fruit.
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:32.200]   We're talking about candy, ice creams, desserts,
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:34.520]   "hidden sugars."
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:36.520]   What are the real risks of these things
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.320]   if people are consuming them still within the confines
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.160]   of their daily caloric needs?
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:45.140]   So they're not eating excess calories.
[02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:48.160]   What's the deal with sugar?
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:51.240]   - Okay, so this is where it's very important
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:52.880]   to give the appropriate context and nuance.
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:54.920]   I'm glad you set it up the way you did.
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:59.920]   So I always tell people when it comes to almost anything,
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:02.040]   have guidelines, not hard rules.
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:03.920]   Because hard rules will get you to do things
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:06.200]   that are kind of dumb, right?
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:07.480]   So for example, if you say,
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:10.240]   "I'm never gonna eat processed foods."
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.640]   Well, whey protein is processed,
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:13.320]   but if you look at the data on whey protein,
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:14.600]   it improves metabolic health,
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:17.300]   it increases lean mass, body composition,
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:18.600]   even lowers inflammation.
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:21.480]   So I mean, if we're just gonna say all processed foods
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:24.000]   are bad, well, isn't then whey bad?
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.280]   So guidelines in that nature, same thing for sugar,
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:30.520]   because obviously, okay, well, added sugar,
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:35.280]   it doesn't have a big satiety benefit.
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:38.840]   It's calorically dense, makes food very palatable.
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:41.340]   I'm gonna come back to that 'cause it's contextual.
[02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:45.720]   But fruit has sugar and biochemically,
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:46.840]   not really that different.
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:48.720]   I mean, if you're talking about sucrose, okay,
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.040]   it's a molecule of glucose and fructose.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:55.400]   Okay, a lot of fruits have glucose and fructose in them.
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:59.720]   So if sugar has some inherent
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:05.560]   lipogenic biochemical toxicity,
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:07.520]   addictive quality, whatever,
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:09.780]   we should see similar effects
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:12.680]   across different sources of sugar.
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:14.920]   And we don't see that, right?
[02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:19.860]   And even when it comes to some of the processed foods,
[02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:21.640]   people don't realize what goes into
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:25.280]   making something hyperpalatable is complex.
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:28.700]   It's not just sugar, it's not just fat,
[02:43:28.700 --> 02:43:33.200]   it's not just sodium, it's texture, mouthfeel,
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:37.480]   you mentioned temperature, all these things matter.
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:40.680]   And in fact, there was actually a study a while back
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:42.840]   that suggested that texture might actually
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:46.680]   make a bigger impact on the palatability of a food
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:48.500]   than even the sugar content.
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:52.680]   And let's take it more from a mechanistic level,
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:53.520]   from your example.
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:58.520]   If you're in the confines of your calories, what happens?
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:01.980]   I would say a high sugar diet is still not ideal
[02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:04.000]   because it's gonna be hard to get enough fiber
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:04.840]   in a high sugar diet.
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:08.840]   But I, long time ago, beginning of grad school,
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.660]   I was under the opinion that sugar
[02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:15.480]   and high fructose corn syrup were calorie per calorie,
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:18.160]   more fattening, metabolically unhealthy.
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:20.480]   Now I was at a graduate mixer
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:24.160]   with a professor named Manny Nakamura, who was at Illinois,
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:27.080]   and he had done some of the feeding studies in rats
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:30.980]   with fructose and seen these weird metabolic effects, right?
[02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:34.120]   And I overheard him having a conversation
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:37.600]   with another professor, and I was shocked by what he said,
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:40.160]   'cause he's the one that did some of this research.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:41.120]   And the other professor said,
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:44.240]   "So high fructose corn syrup is bad, and fructose is bad."
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:47.840]   He goes, "No, it's really just the calories that are in it.
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:49.280]   "It's easy to overconsume.
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:50.840]   "People consume it through soda,
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:52.240]   "and they just eat too much."
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:53.460]   And the guy was like,
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:55.920]   "Well, you showed all these things in these mice."
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:58.500]   He goes, "We fed 'em like over 50% of their calories
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:00.000]   "were from pure fructose.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.320]   "That's pretty much impossible to get through the diet,
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:05.220]   "unless you're literally doing nothing but drinking soda."
[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:09.040]   And he said, "We showed a pathway,
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:11.160]   "but that's not practical
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.600]   "in terms of the application to humans."
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:16.120]   And so I got curious,
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:18.460]   and I really started going down the literature on sugar,
[02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:21.100]   trying to say, "Okay, is he right about this?
[02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:25.640]   "Is it really not calorie per calorie more damaging
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:27.960]   "than non-sugar carbohydrate?"
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:31.840]   When you look at sugar intake,
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:35.660]   it is associated with increased levels of inflammation.
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:37.240]   It's associated with obesity.
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:42.240]   But there are what we call confounding variables,
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:44.800]   which is people who eat a lot of sugar
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:46.560]   tend to eat a lot of calories.
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:49.400]   So if we look at, here's my favorite,
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.540]   human randomized control trials,
[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:54.560]   where we control total calorie intake and sugar intake,
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.960]   what do we see?
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:57.520]   And probably the best example of this
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:01.160]   was a study from Surwit back in, I want to say, 1997.
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:03.320]   And the reason I'm gonna pick out this study
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:05.600]   is 'cause it had the best controls in it.
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:07.760]   So they provided all the food to participants.
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:11.620]   The protein, carbohydrates, and fats were all the same.
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:15.340]   It was a, I think it was a 1,200 calorie diet.
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:17.040]   And they provided all these meals for six weeks
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:19.520]   and looked at fat loss and some blood lipids
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:21.680]   and those sorts of things.
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:23.040]   And they found that,
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:25.760]   so one group was getting over 100 grams of sugar a day.
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:27.040]   I think it was around, I mean,
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:29.440]   it was based on some like body weight
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:30.480]   and energy expenditure stuff.
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:35.160]   But I think it was around like 110 grams of sucrose per day.
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:36.000]   Right?
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.640]   A lot of sugar.
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:39.620]   Other group, like around 10.
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:41.200]   So 10 times different sugar.
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:44.880]   And at the end of the study,
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:46.420]   there was no difference in fat loss.
[02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:48.440]   There was no difference in lean mass retention.
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:51.360]   There was no difference in almost any marker they looked at.
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:53.080]   The only difference they saw,
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:54.580]   all the blood markers improved.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:56.240]   The only difference they saw
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:59.400]   was that LDL cholesterol improved a little bit better
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:00.640]   in the low sugar group.
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:01.920]   And that is probably a function
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:04.280]   of the fact that the low sugar group had more fiber.
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:06.960]   We know fiber can bind to cholesterol
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:08.920]   and lower LDL cholesterol in the blood.
[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:11.920]   So when I saw that, I was like, oh man.
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:13.660]   And then when I looked through all these other studies
[02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:15.860]   with similar kind of controls,
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:18.040]   they pretty much show the same thing across the board
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:22.800]   on metabolic health, on inflammation.
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:24.460]   Like inflammation really isn't different
[02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:26.280]   if calories are controlled with high sugar
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:29.640]   versus low sugar, as long as you're getting enough fiber.
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:32.400]   - What about feelings of satiety because-
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:35.640]   - Well, that is the real downside if you're eating a lot.
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:37.480]   Like if you're eating a 1200 calorie diet
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:39.360]   and 400 calories are coming from pure sugar,
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:41.400]   I mean, you're probably gonna be kind of hungry, right?
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:42.720]   - Yeah, I'd be extremely hungry.
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:45.720]   I mean, I consume artificial sweeteners for the record,
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:47.160]   but there are enough data
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:48.680]   and I have enough experience with them
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:52.480]   to know that sometimes they will curb my appetite.
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:54.280]   Like they'll get me over the bump,
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:56.200]   but I've come to associate,
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:59.240]   it's probably just pure paired placebo association,
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.160]   if there is such a thing, where if I drink a Diet Coke,
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:04.220]   pretty soon after that, I wanna eat something.
[02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:06.600]   Now I've challenged that by not eating something
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:10.160]   'cause I have pretty good discipline and it passes.
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:13.440]   But I think I've come to associate the sweet taste
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:14.560]   with wanting to eat something.
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:16.200]   And nothing to me is more delicious,
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:17.080]   well, there are many things,
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:19.760]   like a Diet Coke and a slice of pizza from New York,
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:21.120]   or a Diet Coke and a burger,
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:23.760]   or there are these food associations,
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.440]   but I don't think for instance,
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:28.920]   that sweet taste necessarily stimulates appetite.
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:30.640]   But I can imagine if I only had,
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:32.920]   as you said, 1200 calories a day to eat,
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:36.200]   and I'm getting 400 of those calories from sugar,
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:37.600]   like you said, there's not gonna be much,
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:39.960]   I better be eating a lot of broccoli as well,
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:42.880]   or else I'm gonna be pretty hungry,
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:45.760]   just based on my learned relationships
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:49.400]   between sweet taste and food consumption.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:50.440]   - What I tell people is,
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:53.720]   I would focus less on like sugar intake.
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:56.600]   I mean, if you wanna focus on added sugars, that's fine.
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:48:59.400]   Focus on calories, protein and your fiber content, right?
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:01.440]   'Cause if you're getting enough fiber,
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:04.840]   it's gonna be hard to eat a lot of junk doing that, right?
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:09.840]   And when we look at the sugar intake and calorie levels,
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:15.920]   all that kind of stuff,
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:19.400]   actually a great example would be the case of Dr. Mark Halb.
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:20.440]   Are you familiar with him?
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:22.880]   He's at Kansas State, he's a nutrition professor.
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:28.520]   In 2011, he got the name, the Twinkie Diet Professor.
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:31.480]   I'm not sure if you saw this, but he--
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:33.880]   - I know about the Twinkie defense.
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:36.960]   - Right, so he asked his students
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:40.400]   what they thought mattered more for fat loss,
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.800]   the calories you eat or the food choices you make.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:45.800]   And they said, most of them said food choices.
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:48.400]   And he said, okay, let's do an experiment.
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:51.080]   Do you think if I do an 1800 calorie diet
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.760]   from ultra processed foods exclusively,
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:57.640]   that I will lose weight and get healthier?
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:59.120]   And most of the students said no.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:01.800]   And so for 12 weeks, he ate 1800 calories.
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:03.520]   He called it originally the 7-Eleven diet.
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:04.360]   He basically was like,
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.640]   if I couldn't get the 7-Eleven, I didn't need it.
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:08.800]   Now the caveat is he had a multivitamin
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:10.280]   and he had some whey protein
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:11.440]   so that he was getting enough protein
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:12.500]   'cause it's hard to get protein
[02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:14.500]   from some of those ultra processed foods.
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:20.920]   But he ate 1800 calories and he lost 27 pounds
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:22.360]   and all of his blood markers improved
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:24.160]   and his insulin sensitivity improved.
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:28.920]   Now, that seems crazy to a lot of people,
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:31.440]   but for those people who have worked
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:34.360]   and looked at blood work with weight loss and whatnot,
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:36.240]   I mean, it's not that surprising.
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:40.200]   That is one of the biggest levers for metabolic health.
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:43.840]   And so when they asked him afterwards,
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:46.120]   like what a great diet.
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:48.040]   Like you could eat all this junk food.
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:49.600]   And he goes, well, not really.
[02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:52.240]   Like it's 1800 calories of junk food.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:53.840]   It goes really fast.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:54.980]   I was pretty hungry.
[02:50:54.980 --> 02:50:57.880]   And honestly, like at first week it was like,
[02:50:57.880 --> 02:50:58.960]   oh, this is kind of nice.
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:50:59.920]   And then after that, I was like, you know,
[02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:02.120]   I'd really like just a really big salad, you know,
[02:51:02.120 --> 02:51:04.040]   just something satiating.
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:06.940]   So again, no solutions, only trade-offs.
[02:51:06.940 --> 02:51:09.060]   There is a benefit to being able to go,
[02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:13.720]   well, if I can fit it into my calories, it's okay.
[02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:16.040]   As long as I get enough fiber and protein.
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:21.040]   Yeah, the trade-off is it's a high budget cost, right?
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:24.720]   Same thing with people's, you know,
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:26.840]   the data on like moderate alcohol consumption
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:28.520]   shows that it doesn't impede fat loss.
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:30.680]   It doesn't, if you account for the calories in it.
[02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:33.280]   But I'll tell people like, hey, do you really like,
[02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:34.800]   if you have like two craft beers,
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:36.780]   do you really wanna spend four or 500 calories
[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:38.760]   on like 24 ounces of fluid
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:41.160]   that's not gonna impact your satiety at all?
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:45.120]   And so I think a lot of people view this
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:47.800]   from a very black and white lens, right?
[02:51:47.800 --> 02:51:51.520]   Where it's like, oh, Lane says, or this person says,
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:53.960]   I can eat sugar and lose fat,
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:55.400]   so I can eat as much sugar as I want.
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:56.600]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:51:59.080]   'Cause there are practical limits to this, right?
[02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:00.800]   But take somebody like me, right?
[02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:03.540]   If my calorie intake is my budget,
[02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:07.520]   I train two, three hours a day.
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:09.040]   My maintenance calories are anywhere
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:11.120]   from 33 to 3,400 calories a day,
[02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:12.920]   which is a not crazy amount,
[02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:15.180]   but a healthy amount for somebody of my size.
[02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:18.040]   I have a decent size budget, right?
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:22.640]   If I can still get my protein in, get my fiber,
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:24.720]   hit my micronutrient targets,
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:27.720]   and I have calories left over for energy filler,
[02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:30.800]   sure, just like if somebody makes a million dollars a year
[02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:32.960]   and they wanna go buy a sports car,
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:34.320]   it's not a great investment.
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:36.120]   It's not a good investment at all.
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:38.120]   Why wouldn't they just bank every single cent they make?
[02:52:38.120 --> 02:52:40.600]   Well, because maybe for them,
[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:45.080]   having that little reward motivates them
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:46.200]   to keep doing what they're doing
[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:48.260]   and making that level of money, right?
[02:52:48.260 --> 02:52:49.720]   But if you're making,
[02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:51.040]   let's take loans out of it, right?
[02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:53.360]   If you're making $100,000 a year,
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:56.240]   does it make sense to spend $90,000 on a sports car
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:52:57.960]   if it means you can't pay your mortgage
[02:52:57.960 --> 02:52:59.440]   and you can't save money for retirement,
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:01.380]   you can't meet your obligations?
[02:53:01.380 --> 02:53:03.440]   No, it doesn't make sense, right?
[02:53:03.440 --> 02:53:08.120]   And so if you're a small woman, small lean mass wise,
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:11.680]   who is trying to lose some weight,
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:14.280]   does it make sense if you're eating 1,200 calories a day
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:17.200]   to lose weight to spend 300 calories of that
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:20.520]   on some ultra processed junk food?
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:23.340]   I don't think it does.
[02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:26.280]   But if you're an Olympic athlete
[02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:30.160]   who's burning four or 5,000 calories a day,
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:32.680]   good luck eating that level of calories
[02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:35.320]   from good minimally processed foods,
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:37.120]   you're going to feel full all the time.
[02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:42.120]   - There does seem to be a kind of a requirement in books,
[02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:43.960]   sometimes even in podcasts,
[02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:46.460]   or to take a stance, like to be anti something.
[02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:48.600]   Because saying, you know,
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:50.960]   what I personally believe based on my read of the data
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:53.680]   is that most people should strive to get
[02:53:53.680 --> 02:53:58.680]   anywhere from 70 to 90% of their food
[02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:02.620]   from non-processed, minimally processed quality foods.
[02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:05.640]   And then allow some space for the, you know,
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:07.520]   some processed food, highly processed foods
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:08.960]   and sweets and things like that.
[02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:11.400]   But mostly to get the macros right,
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:13.000]   as we've described them earlier.
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.920]   And what the range will depend on age,
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:18.280]   will depend on activity level,
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:19.800]   will depend on prior health history.
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:23.540]   I mean, there's some people who have enough issues
[02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:27.480]   that relate to diet and lack of exercise
[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:30.040]   that when I've seen them get it right
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:32.680]   and undergo such incredible transformations
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:35.740]   that like, I also know these people's capacity
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:37.180]   to fall off the train.
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:38.020]   - Right.
[02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:38.840]   - And you want to say, you know,
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:39.940]   maybe make that number a hundred percent
[02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:40.780]   so you never go back.
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:42.280]   'Cause I've seen them slip before
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:44.580]   and then the guilt and then they come back, excuse me.
[02:54:44.580 --> 02:54:45.700]   So there are two ways to look at it.
[02:54:45.700 --> 02:54:46.980]   One is you tell people, listen,
[02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:48.740]   you don't have to be perfect, right?
[02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:51.180]   'Cause if perfection is the goal, you're going to fall off.
[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:52.560]   But then there are those individuals
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:54.880]   like severe alcoholics who quit drinking.
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:55.720]   You don't say like,
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:54:57.540]   "Hey, like you can have a beer on Christmas."
[02:54:57.540 --> 02:54:59.060]   You don't say that, right?
[02:54:59.060 --> 02:55:00.240]   It's all or none.
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:03.260]   But anyway, here we're getting into the psychology of it.
[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:06.300]   - But I think that that's what you're saying right there
[02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:10.060]   is that's where the individualization comes in, right?
[02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:13.060]   Like it's contextually dependent
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:14.660]   and it's dependent on the individual
[02:55:14.660 --> 02:55:18.060]   and what makes sense for them.
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:21.660]   And I think we, as people,
[02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:23.780]   if we find something that works for us,
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:26.220]   we're a little bit too quick
[02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:29.420]   to want to evangelize everyone else around us
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:31.860]   because we do want to help,
[02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:34.180]   we do have good intentions for the most part,
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:36.020]   and we overgeneralize.
[02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:38.220]   And I've, you know, for me, again,
[02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:40.520]   like counting macros, flexible dieting,
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:42.980]   when I dealt with a little bit of binge eating
[02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:44.940]   when I was young, when I first got into bodybuilding,
[02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:47.840]   'cause I was trying to, you know, eat clean,
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:49.700]   and I was in college,
[02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:50.980]   so my buddies would order pizza or whatever,
[02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:53.980]   and I ended up eating like an entire pizza by myself, right?
[02:55:53.980 --> 02:55:57.180]   And so once I allowed myself to just have that,
[02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:59.380]   the foods I wanted in moderation,
[02:55:59.380 --> 02:56:02.220]   I just got brutally consistent, right?
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:07.100]   So that, for me, that was the switch that flipped,
[02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:10.820]   but other people, that may not be the right solution.
[02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:13.740]   And I think we make a bunch of,
[02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:14.700]   well, that diet worked for me,
[02:56:14.700 --> 02:56:16.900]   and we assume physiology,
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:19.740]   when actually I think it's much more psychology
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:21.940]   and just trips that compliance algorithm
[02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:23.820]   in somebody's head and it makes sense,
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:28.560]   and if we could just be willing to say more often,
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:30.780]   hey, this is what I do, but I like this,
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:34.020]   and you don't have to do it, maybe try it.
[02:56:34.020 --> 02:56:36.900]   - Yeah, oh, and everyone struggles with different things,
[02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:38.740]   and everyone finds certain things easier.
[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:41.340]   Like I'm non-alcoholic, I'm an adult,
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:44.020]   so I can have a drink or two, I just don't like it,
[02:56:44.020 --> 02:56:46.280]   so everyone assumes because I did this episode on alcohol
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:47.420]   that I'm like anti-alcohol.
[02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:50.040]   Like I'm like, if you're an adult and you're non-alcoholic,
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:52.060]   you don't have issues with, you know,
[02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:53.840]   alcohol use disorder or something like,
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:56.240]   you might guess, like just know the data, right?
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:59.860]   But there are certain things like steak,
[02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:01.380]   I'm never giving up.
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:04.060]   Like you could tell me it takes 10 years off my life,
[02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:05.140]   and I'm not going to give it up.
[02:57:05.140 --> 02:57:08.980]   I'll do other things to offset whatever that, you know,
[02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:10.760]   decrease in longevity might be.
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:13.140]   I don't think that that's a real thing,
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:14.380]   but I'm just not going to give it up.
[02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:17.640]   It's central to my enjoyment of life, period.
[02:57:17.640 --> 02:57:19.640]   Speaking of which, when,
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:22.400]   if one really wants to wade into the waters
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:25.040]   of strong opinions and conflicting data,
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:27.240]   we covered this a bit last time you were on the podcast,
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.320]   but the questions were replete
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:34.960]   with requests to discuss seed oils.
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:35.780]   - I'm sure.
[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:36.620]   - Seed oils.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.560]   And I must say this whole thing about seed oils
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:40.400]   has really gotten in my head.
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:42.240]   Even though I'm a scientist,
[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:44.800]   like the other day I went to my sister's for dinner
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:46.880]   and she made a really nice dinner.
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:48.040]   It was for our mom's birthday.
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:50.080]   And then she made a really nice salad
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:51.260]   and I love fruits and vegetables.
[02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:52.100]   So it was like salad.
[02:57:52.100 --> 02:57:52.920]   And then I looked and I was like,
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:54.680]   she's made this out with like grapeseed oil.
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:56.000]   And I was like, why do you use grapeseed oil
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:56.840]   instead of olive oil?
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:57:58.360]   And she's like, well, I ran out of olive oil.
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:01.400]   And I found myself like looking at the salad,
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:02.880]   like, is this safe to eat?
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:05.280]   And I was like, I heard your voice in my ear.
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:07.100]   I also heard Paul's voice in my ear.
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:07.940]   Salad, you know, it was all these people.
[02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:10.120]   And I thought, well, I ate the salad, by the way.
[02:58:10.120 --> 02:58:10.960]   I really enjoyed it.
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:11.800]   It was good.
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:14.520]   Grapeseed oil doesn't taste as good to me as olive oil.
[02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:17.220]   I generally like try and use olive oil, butter,
[02:58:17.220 --> 02:58:19.400]   things like that when I cook.
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:23.300]   But what's the deal with seed oils?
[02:58:23.300 --> 02:58:26.240]   I understand that they are calorically dense.
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:27.220]   You told us that last time.
[02:58:27.220 --> 02:58:28.920]   I understand people tend to over-consume them
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:30.440]   and then blame them for a bunch of things
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:32.520]   that are not related to their seed oil-ness
[02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:35.800]   rather than their calorie containing-ness.
[02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:38.320]   These aren't real words, of course, but you get the idea.
[02:58:38.320 --> 02:58:43.320]   But are there any data out there that have your,
[02:58:43.320 --> 02:58:46.320]   you know, ears kind of pricked up to the possibility
[02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:48.660]   that, assuming equal calories,
[02:58:48.660 --> 02:58:52.140]   that there might be something bad about seed oils,
[02:58:52.140 --> 02:58:52.980]   or is there zero?
[02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:55.020]   And there's no pressure here to answer one way or the other.
[02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:57.580]   Not that you would respond to pressure from me anyway.
[02:58:57.580 --> 02:59:01.700]   - So I think it's all about making
[02:59:01.700 --> 02:59:04.620]   the appropriate apples to apples comparison, right?
[02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:07.260]   'Cause if we're looking at addition studies
[02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:10.100]   of, you know, adding something to a diet,
[02:59:10.100 --> 02:59:14.620]   adding omega-6s, linoleic acid,
[02:59:14.620 --> 02:59:16.100]   linoleic acid, whatever,
[02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:20.100]   well, if you're adding those, you're adding calories,
[02:59:20.100 --> 02:59:22.360]   which is a confounding variable, right?
[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:24.900]   So ideally what the real question is,
[02:59:24.900 --> 02:59:26.980]   'cause the debate tends to be,
[02:59:26.980 --> 02:59:28.620]   the people who are anti-seed oil
[02:59:28.620 --> 02:59:30.380]   tend to be very pro-saturated fat.
[02:59:30.380 --> 02:59:33.060]   And so the question really is,
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:38.060]   okay, if we swap out these things in a one-to-one ratio,
[02:59:38.060 --> 02:59:40.420]   what is the outcome, right?
[02:59:40.420 --> 02:59:43.880]   So not, like, when outcome I mean metabolic health,
[02:59:44.720 --> 02:59:47.620]   inflammation, those sorts of things.
[02:59:47.620 --> 02:59:52.400]   So in the studies, I have yet to find
[02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:56.840]   a good human randomized control trial
[02:59:56.840 --> 02:59:59.520]   where they give polyunsaturated fat
[02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:02.200]   in place of saturated fat, you know,
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:04.020]   exchanged at a one-to-one ratio,
[03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:09.320]   and see negative, like, actual outcomes.
[03:00:09.320 --> 03:00:12.120]   - What about swapping with monounsaturated fats?
[03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:13.980]   Like, why are we talking about seed oils
[03:00:13.980 --> 03:00:15.560]   versus lard and butter?
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:18.240]   Why aren't we talking about seed oils versus olive oil?
[03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:20.720]   - Yeah, that's, I've looked less into that
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:23.020]   just 'cause people ask that question yet less,
[03:00:23.020 --> 03:00:28.080]   but it seems like both PUFAs and MUFAs
[03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:29.880]   are better than saturated fat
[03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:31.080]   in terms of metabolic health
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:33.960]   and risk of cardiovascular disease, those sorts of things.
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:37.840]   - Does anyone have a problem with olive oil?
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:38.920]   - I'm sure you could find somebody with a problem.
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:40.320]   - Okay, well, I shouldn't be right.
[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:41.920]   - There's water now.
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:43.680]   - Terrible way for me to pose the question.
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:45.760]   Is there any reason to think,
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:48.720]   like, for the person who isn't sure about seed oils
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:50.520]   'cause they've just heard enough negative things,
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:53.160]   even if there's no basis for it, like me,
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:54.520]   who's like, I like butter,
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:57.400]   and I also assume that eating too much butter
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:00:58.360]   might not be good for me
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:00.640]   just 'cause I'm a rational human being
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:03.440]   based on my read of the data anyway.
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:05.920]   So I have some butter, yes, but I like olive oil.
[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:08.800]   Olive oil's tasty, I'm told it's good for me.
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:11.960]   - Is there any knowledge about anything in olive oil
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:15.120]   that says, listen, even if you consume it
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:18.340]   in concert with your caloric thresholds,
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:20.120]   meaning you're not eating too many calories,
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:22.080]   is there anything bad in olive oil?
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:24.760]   - I'm not aware of anything, but I will say,
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:28.440]   like, if you extend the logic of the seed oils crowd
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:29.440]   or anti-seed oils crowd,
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:32.080]   which actually I'm going to make a new logical fallacy,
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:34.080]   which is just appeal to seed oils.
[03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:36.920]   'Cause so many times that I've laid out this data,
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:40.560]   I have people go basically like have a freak out
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:43.120]   and go, but seed oils, how dare you defend seed oils?
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:45.000]   And I'm like, I'm not defending them,
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.440]   I'm just talking about data.
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:49.400]   - People on X, when I put out questions
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:50.800]   for your coming on this episode,
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:52.480]   literally there were multiple people
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:57.480]   that claim that you are paid off by big seed oil.
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:01:59.440]   And I was just like, I have to laugh out loud.
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:01.160]   I was like, there might be a lot of companies
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.200]   that are large that make seed oils,
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:05.920]   but I guarantee they're not paying
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:08.400]   Lane Norton to say what he's saying.
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:10.440]   - So I find this actually very funny
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:11.880]   as somebody whose research was funded
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:15.280]   by the National Dairy Council, the Egg Nutrition Center,
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:18.120]   and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association,
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:22.960]   that somehow I would be the person who would be,
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:26.120]   you know, and all these things act in opposition too.
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:29.800]   It's like, well, you think I'm pro seed oil,
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:32.400]   but then over here I've been defending meat
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:34.320]   with this thing, right?
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:36.920]   And then over here I've been defending,
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:38.280]   sorry, defending is the wrong word,
[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:40.720]   discussing the data on sugar, which by the way,
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:42.800]   those would be in opposition to each other
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:44.560]   'cause you're-- - And you're very pro fiber.
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:46.240]   - Right, right. - So, yeah.
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:48.280]   - So, and even when I talk about saturated fat,
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:50.280]   I don't like say it's toxic and it's gonna do,
[03:02:50.280 --> 03:02:52.640]   I say, hey, it raises LDL cholesterol,
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:54.680]   which is an independent risk factor for heart disease.
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:57.160]   I'm just discussing it, right?
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:02:59.960]   So, I'll say what I said online,
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:02.320]   which is I don't defend nutrients.
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:03.320]   They don't need defending.
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:05.400]   There's not ethical considerations here.
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:06.320]   If you want to eat them,
[03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:08.320]   I don't think you're less of a person.
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:13.000]   And I find it curious that some people get so emotionally
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:18.000]   and just like ethically entrenched
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.040]   around certain nutrients.
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:22.360]   So the logic goes something like,
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:24.920]   well, you have these multiple double bonds,
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:27.440]   and so they can be oxidized.
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:29.800]   And so that oxidation is gonna cause
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:31.260]   an increase in inflammation,
[03:03:31.260 --> 03:03:34.040]   which is gonna cause heart disease and cancer, okay?
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:36.320]   Well, olive oil is a monounsaturated fat.
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:37.720]   It still has a double bond.
[03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:39.880]   So by that logic, it would still be worse
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:40.880]   than saturated fat.
[03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:46.240]   So when we look at trading out,
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:49.200]   and MUFAs would fall in this too, I believe.
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:50.960]   If you look at the cohort data,
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:53.800]   polyunsaturated fats substituted for saturated fats
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:55.720]   have a stronger effect on reducing heart disease
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:58.880]   than monounsaturated fats.
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:03.200]   But monounsaturated fats do still tend to have
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.160]   an effect of reducing the risk of heart disease
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:08.040]   compared to saturated fat.
[03:04:08.040 --> 03:04:11.520]   - Okay, so that would be trading out butter and lard
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:14.560]   and meat fats for more olive oil.
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:16.840]   - Right, and just to add some nuance to it,
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:18.440]   not all saturated fat is created equal.
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:20.200]   There are like stearic acid, I believe,
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:22.880]   doesn't raise LDL cholesterol.
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:25.560]   But in general, saturated fat is gonna be something
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:26.400]   that raises cholesterol more.
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:29.600]   It also, again, and I'm thinking of several
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:33.400]   randomized control trials where they feed the same calories,
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:34.640]   they feed the same amount of fat,
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:36.880]   and they just have people either eat, you know,
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:40.800]   saturated fat or polyunsaturated fats.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:44.920]   You see either neutral or positive effects on inflammation.
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:47.520]   You see neutral positive effects on liver fat.
[03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:49.680]   You see neutral positive effects on basically
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:52.280]   overall metabolic health and insulin sensitivity.
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:56.280]   So again, and Paul actually counted this one time,
[03:04:56.280 --> 03:04:59.360]   and he cited a study looking at, I think it was,
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:01.400]   I don't wanna say it wrong, but it was like
[03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:02.940]   giving Omega-6s and they saw an increase
[03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:04.840]   in lipid peroxidation.
[03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:07.160]   I don't think they were comparing it to saturated fat.
[03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:08.480]   I could be wrong.
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:11.480]   But again, this is an example of a mechanism, right?
[03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:13.280]   So lipid peroxidation mechanism.
[03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:17.440]   We can try to project what that might mean down the road,
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:20.420]   but when we look at actual levels of inflammation,
[03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:22.660]   actual risk for cardiovascular disease,
[03:05:22.660 --> 03:05:26.660]   actual insulin sensitivity, actual levels of liver fat,
[03:05:26.660 --> 03:05:28.140]   these are outcomes.
[03:05:28.140 --> 03:05:30.220]   We can actually, if we're worried about those,
[03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:32.240]   we can actually measure them.
[03:05:32.240 --> 03:05:35.040]   And again, some studies show no difference.
[03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:36.840]   Some studies, some of the studies I've seen
[03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:40.960]   on like inflammation between polyunsaturated fats
[03:05:40.960 --> 03:05:44.540]   and saturated fats don't really show a difference
[03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:46.580]   in inflammation, but I'm not aware of any
[03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:48.560]   that show it going in the opposite direction
[03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:50.660]   where substituting in polyunsaturated fats
[03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:54.180]   actually raises inflammatory markers like CRP and IL-6,
[03:05:54.180 --> 03:05:55.300]   those sorts of things.
[03:05:55.300 --> 03:05:57.700]   And actually one of the things I tell people
[03:05:57.700 --> 03:05:59.700]   when they're worried about, you know,
[03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:02.420]   fructose activates the novel lipogenesis in the liver.
[03:06:02.420 --> 03:06:04.180]   And I'm like, well, here's this study
[03:06:04.180 --> 03:06:06.420]   where they overfed fructose and saturated fat
[03:06:06.420 --> 03:06:08.980]   by the same amount and saturated fat increased liver fat
[03:06:08.980 --> 03:06:11.280]   by 70% more than fructose.
[03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:13.740]   So if you're worried about fructose,
[03:06:13.740 --> 03:06:16.240]   you better really be worried about saturated fat.
[03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:19.060]   Now again, both, that's an overfeeding study.
[03:06:19.060 --> 03:06:21.700]   They were eating excess calories, but again,
[03:06:21.700 --> 03:06:24.700]   calorie per calorie, saturated fat was worse for liver fat.
[03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:31.380]   So that's kind of where I land on it.
[03:06:31.380 --> 03:06:35.780]   I just, you know, maybe I'm missing some data,
[03:06:35.780 --> 03:06:39.420]   but when you're looking at these studies,
[03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:43.700]   again, I'm looking at not one study, not two studies,
[03:06:43.700 --> 03:06:46.160]   I'm looking at 50 studies
[03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:48.240]   or however many studies there is on the topic.
[03:06:48.240 --> 03:06:52.820]   And I go on this forest plot, where do they land?
[03:06:52.820 --> 03:06:57.780]   And when they're almost all on one side or neutral,
[03:06:57.780 --> 03:06:59.180]   I feel pretty confident
[03:06:59.180 --> 03:07:01.100]   that that's something not to worry about, right?
[03:07:01.100 --> 03:07:04.060]   So let's take another discussion to tie this in.
[03:07:04.060 --> 03:07:05.260]   I think this will help people understand
[03:07:05.260 --> 03:07:08.100]   how I come to a conclusion about this sort of stuff.
[03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:11.660]   So I do not necessarily think red meat is carcinogenic,
[03:07:11.660 --> 03:07:14.780]   even though the IRC has classified it
[03:07:14.780 --> 03:07:17.100]   as probably carcinogenic, right?
[03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:21.380]   Because when you look at the studies,
[03:07:21.380 --> 03:07:24.280]   you can find studies that associate red meat with cancer,
[03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:25.180]   and you can find studies
[03:07:25.180 --> 03:07:28.740]   that show no association of red meat with cancer.
[03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:30.840]   And so it's kind of all over the place.
[03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:31.980]   Now, there's probably more
[03:07:31.980 --> 03:07:34.580]   that show the association than don't,
[03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:36.820]   but when you look at like studies
[03:07:36.820 --> 03:07:39.140]   where they control for overall diet quality,
[03:07:39.140 --> 03:07:42.540]   so I'm thinking of a study out of Canada back in 2020,
[03:07:42.540 --> 03:07:46.000]   I think the author was Maximova, I wanna say.
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:49.740]   They looked at different levels of red meat intake
[03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:50.900]   and incidence of cancer,
[03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:53.100]   but also with different levels
[03:07:53.100 --> 03:07:54.940]   of fruit and vegetable intake.
[03:07:54.940 --> 03:07:55.980]   And so what they found was
[03:07:55.980 --> 03:07:58.220]   at low levels of fruit and vegetable intake,
[03:07:58.220 --> 03:08:01.940]   lower red meat consumption reduced the risk of cancer
[03:08:01.940 --> 03:08:04.140]   relative to higher red meat consumption.
[03:08:04.140 --> 03:08:07.380]   But at high levels of fruits and vegetable consumption,
[03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:10.660]   I don't think there was a significant difference,
[03:08:10.660 --> 03:08:13.260]   but actually the high level of red meat consumption
[03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:17.140]   was lower risk than low red meat, high fruit and vegetables.
[03:08:17.140 --> 03:08:20.660]   I believe I have that correct in terms of the absolute risk.
[03:08:20.660 --> 03:08:22.580]   And I don't know if it was statistically significant,
[03:08:22.580 --> 03:08:27.140]   but what that says to me is red meat is more of a proxy
[03:08:27.140 --> 03:08:29.100]   of poor overall diet quality.
[03:08:29.100 --> 03:08:30.380]   And if you control for that
[03:08:30.380 --> 03:08:33.900]   with some diet proxy of fruit and vegetable intake,
[03:08:33.900 --> 03:08:35.540]   you know, if you're eating a lot of red meat
[03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:36.900]   and a lot of fruit and vegetables,
[03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:38.540]   there's not really a whole lot of room in your diet
[03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:39.480]   for a bunch of crap.
[03:08:39.480 --> 03:08:41.860]   - You just described the way that I eat
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:43.220]   and that anytime a friend of mine,
[03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:44.460]   and this happens a lot,
[03:08:44.460 --> 03:08:49.380]   comes to me and has, you know, 20 to 50 pounds to lose.
[03:08:49.380 --> 03:08:51.980]   You know, well, make it as easy on yourself as possible.
[03:08:51.980 --> 03:08:55.960]   You can eat meat, eggs, vegetables, and fruit,
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:08:57.980]   and that's all you're gonna do for two months.
[03:08:57.980 --> 03:09:00.800]   And most of those guys in this case,
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:04.740]   they were guys, lost a substantial amount of weight
[03:09:04.740 --> 03:09:05.580]   and kept it off.
[03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:07.220]   They all exercised as well.
[03:09:07.220 --> 03:09:08.980]   And of course, it's caloric restriction related.
[03:09:08.980 --> 03:09:09.820]   - Yeah, hard to overeat those foods.
[03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:11.300]   - Yeah, but they're not touching pasta.
[03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:12.180]   They're not touching bread.
[03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:14.180]   They ask me all the things that, can I do this?
[03:09:14.180 --> 03:09:15.080]   And I just said, listen,
[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:16.420]   if it wasn't in the list I just gave you,
[03:09:16.420 --> 03:09:17.300]   you're not eating it.
[03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:18.540]   Sounds restrictive.
[03:09:18.540 --> 03:09:19.940]   The good news about something like that
[03:09:19.940 --> 03:09:22.260]   is that fruit generally tastes good
[03:09:22.260 --> 03:09:26.660]   and steak is very satiating, it's delicious.
[03:09:26.660 --> 03:09:28.700]   If you don't like meat, I suppose this wouldn't work,
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:32.340]   but I don't think there's anything magic about that diet.
[03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:35.780]   It just gets people below their maintenance calories
[03:09:35.780 --> 03:09:38.060]   with relative ease.
[03:09:38.060 --> 03:09:39.340]   - Well, it's simple.
[03:09:39.340 --> 03:09:41.260]   You could probably still do it at a restaurant, right?
[03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:43.060]   'Cause you just asked for meat and vegetables, right?
[03:09:43.060 --> 03:09:44.460]   - Socially compatible.
[03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:47.240]   - So there is some beauty in simplicity.
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:49.700]   There's beauty in what I do, which is I track everything
[03:09:49.700 --> 03:09:51.860]   and I can have whatever I want.
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:53.340]   You're gonna have to have some form of restriction
[03:09:53.340 --> 03:09:54.180]   to lose weight.
[03:09:54.180 --> 03:09:55.860]   You pick the kind of restriction
[03:09:55.860 --> 03:09:57.900]   that you can stick to, right?
[03:09:57.900 --> 03:10:00.260]   So bringing that all back.
[03:10:00.260 --> 03:10:03.300]   So you have this data that's all scattered on meat, right?
[03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:07.180]   And then let's look at something like dietary fiber, okay?
[03:10:07.180 --> 03:10:09.620]   'Cause people say, well, you can't establish causation.
[03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:11.340]   This is, some people might say, well,
[03:10:11.340 --> 03:10:15.180]   the carnivores might say, well, it's all healthy user bias.
[03:10:15.180 --> 03:10:16.580]   If it was healthy user bias,
[03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:18.200]   there'd be some disagreement in the data
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:20.340]   and there's no disagreement in the data.
[03:10:20.340 --> 03:10:24.100]   I am not aware of any study looking at dietary fiber intake
[03:10:24.100 --> 03:10:25.060]   or fruit and vegetable intake
[03:10:25.060 --> 03:10:27.100]   that doesn't show reduced risk of cancer,
[03:10:27.100 --> 03:10:28.860]   reduced risk of cardiovascular disease,
[03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:32.580]   reduced risk of mortality, usually in a dose response.
[03:10:32.580 --> 03:10:34.940]   And it is very consistent.
[03:10:34.940 --> 03:10:37.660]   Now, some studies might show more of a risk reduction
[03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:38.940]   versus other studies.
[03:10:38.940 --> 03:10:41.380]   But if we're doing a line of a forest plot
[03:10:41.380 --> 03:10:44.140]   and this is risk reduction, this is increased risk,
[03:10:44.140 --> 03:10:45.660]   everything's on this side, right?
[03:10:45.660 --> 03:10:47.340]   - Eating more fruits and vegetables
[03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:48.500]   can only be good for you.
[03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:53.340]   - Right, so, and there's like kind of a dose response.
[03:10:53.340 --> 03:10:54.940]   So that's when I become,
[03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:58.200]   even without randomized control trials necessarily,
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:00.340]   that's when I get pretty confident,
[03:11:00.340 --> 03:11:02.340]   okay, this is a very consistent effect
[03:11:02.340 --> 03:11:04.940]   and there's a dose response
[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:07.020]   and we're seeing it in a bunch of different populations
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:08.540]   across a bunch of different countries
[03:11:08.540 --> 03:11:09.700]   in a bunch of different labs.
[03:11:09.700 --> 03:11:11.380]   Okay, I feel confident.
[03:11:11.380 --> 03:11:13.260]   And so for somebody to make the claim
[03:11:13.260 --> 03:11:16.060]   that seed oils are toxic or that they're bad for you
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:18.100]   independent of the calories,
[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:23.100]   I mean, you're basically relegated to using animal studies
[03:11:23.100 --> 03:11:27.540]   in vitro mechanisms and then epidemiology,
[03:11:27.540 --> 03:11:31.180]   which trying to like tie those all together,
[03:11:31.180 --> 03:11:33.880]   I mean, that's not really high quality evidence.
[03:11:33.880 --> 03:11:38.880]   Really high quality evidence is that you have the mechanisms.
[03:11:38.880 --> 03:11:40.280]   Okay, there's a mechanism, right?
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:42.560]   'Cause if there's an outcome, there's a mechanism.
[03:11:42.560 --> 03:11:44.120]   The animal data agrees with it.
[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:45.880]   There's a dose response.
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:47.880]   The human randomized controls trial supported
[03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:50.080]   and then the epidemiology supports it.
[03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:51.200]   Like in order for something
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:54.040]   to really truly be strong evidence, we need that.
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:56.620]   Now let's take our example of fiber again, right?
[03:11:56.620 --> 03:11:58.240]   Epidemiology supports it.
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:00.000]   We have mechanisms in terms
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:01.640]   of short chain fatty acid production,
[03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:03.440]   in terms of like insoluble fiber,
[03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:06.280]   moving, like getting food through the gut faster
[03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:09.620]   might be actually better because there's some,
[03:12:09.620 --> 03:12:10.600]   I don't wanna use this word lightly,
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.280]   but like some semi-toxic end products
[03:12:13.280 --> 03:12:15.360]   of like metabolism in the gut
[03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:16.960]   that if they stay around too long,
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:18.380]   it might have negative interactions
[03:12:18.380 --> 03:12:20.640]   with some of the colorectal cells.
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:22.360]   And that may be one of the reasons
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:24.360]   that insoluble fiber helps decrease the risk
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:26.600]   of colorectal cancer.
[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:31.180]   So we have the mechanisms, the animal studies show it.
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:32.820]   When we do the human randomized control trials,
[03:12:32.820 --> 03:12:34.900]   looking at shorter term surrogate markers,
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:36.540]   they show it move in the right direction
[03:12:36.540 --> 03:12:39.020]   and the epidemiology is in the right direction.
[03:12:39.020 --> 03:12:41.660]   That's when I become very confident about something.
[03:12:41.660 --> 03:12:43.140]   So I'm not ready to say like,
[03:12:43.140 --> 03:12:45.340]   "Hey, seed oils are really, really good for you
[03:12:45.340 --> 03:12:46.780]   and you should have a bunch of them."
[03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:47.740]   I'm not saying that.
[03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:49.340]   Obviously they're calorically dense, right?
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:51.600]   People add oil to stuff and it adds calories.
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:54.580]   But anybody trying to claim
[03:12:54.580 --> 03:12:57.540]   that there's strong evidence that they're bad for you,
[03:12:57.540 --> 03:12:59.300]   we have very different definitions
[03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:00.740]   of what strong evidence is.
[03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:04.820]   And you have to apply your logic symmetrically.
[03:13:04.820 --> 03:13:07.380]   If you were going to use a certain level of logic
[03:13:07.380 --> 03:13:11.620]   for one thing, you have to apply it to another thing, right?
[03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:14.280]   And I'll give you an example of this.
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:18.660]   When they were talking about the cruciferous vegetables
[03:13:18.660 --> 03:13:20.580]   and isocyanthanates and it reduces iodine,
[03:13:20.580 --> 03:13:24.380]   I said, "Well, this person was advocating
[03:13:24.380 --> 03:13:25.900]   for a meat-based diet."
[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:30.900]   And I'm like, "Okay, well, there's NUE5GC in meat,
[03:13:30.900 --> 03:13:35.020]   which by the way, they found antibodies
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:37.820]   for that in human thyroid."
[03:13:37.820 --> 03:13:41.780]   Now, I'm not saying that meat's gonna mess up your thyroid,
[03:13:41.780 --> 03:13:42.940]   but if you're worried about the stuff
[03:13:42.940 --> 03:13:44.100]   in cruciferous vegetables,
[03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:45.880]   don't you have to worry about it in meat too?
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:48.260]   Because if you're applying that logic symmetrically,
[03:13:48.260 --> 03:13:50.220]   I would actually argue that there's stronger evidence
[03:13:50.220 --> 03:13:52.820]   that you're worried about the NUE5GC in meat
[03:13:52.820 --> 03:13:55.400]   since you actually see those antibodies show up.
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:58.740]   So with the seed oil stuff, I'm like,
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:00.880]   "Okay, let's apply this logic
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:02.980]   to saturated fat for a moment, all right?"
[03:14:02.980 --> 03:14:06.540]   So do we have a mechanism?
[03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:07.860]   We do.
[03:14:07.860 --> 03:14:10.520]   Saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol.
[03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:15.960]   Well, LDL cholesterol can penetrate the endothelium.
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:17.020]   We know this.
[03:14:17.020 --> 03:14:19.980]   So there gets to be this debate about small oxidized
[03:14:19.980 --> 03:14:21.680]   versus large fluffy.
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:23.660]   Both can penetrate the endothelium.
[03:14:23.660 --> 03:14:26.620]   Even large LDL can penetrate the endothelium.
[03:14:26.620 --> 03:14:30.180]   Now, small oxidized penetrates more easily,
[03:14:30.180 --> 03:14:32.500]   but it carries less total cholesterol
[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:35.300]   and deposits less cholesterol in the endothelium.
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:38.740]   Large doesn't penetrate as easily,
[03:14:38.740 --> 03:14:43.100]   but per unit of LDL cholesterol,
[03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:46.220]   it's depositing more cholesterol because it's bigger.
[03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:49.900]   The net effect is both are equally atherogenic.
[03:14:49.900 --> 03:14:51.140]   In the end.
[03:14:51.140 --> 03:14:53.660]   So we have the mechanism, right?
[03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:55.460]   Now let's look at the epidemiology.
[03:14:55.460 --> 03:14:57.780]   Well, the epidemiology tends to support it as well.
[03:14:57.780 --> 03:15:00.940]   And then if we look at the really what,
[03:15:00.940 --> 03:15:02.380]   for me, changed my mind,
[03:15:02.380 --> 03:15:04.460]   because I used to be somebody who was on the side of,
[03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:06.180]   "Ah, LDL doesn't really matter.
[03:15:06.180 --> 03:15:07.820]   It's HDL to LDL ratio."
[03:15:07.820 --> 03:15:12.300]   And was when I saw the Mendelian randomization studies,
[03:15:12.300 --> 03:15:14.420]   which for those who aren't familiar,
[03:15:14.420 --> 03:15:19.420]   you're basically looking at natural polymorphisms
[03:15:19.420 --> 03:15:23.900]   on genes that cause differences in secretion of LDL, right?
[03:15:23.900 --> 03:15:29.820]   And since LDL is a lifetime exposure risk,
[03:15:29.820 --> 03:15:34.200]   meaning if you're doing a two-year randomized control trial,
[03:15:34.200 --> 03:15:35.700]   looking at LDL levels,
[03:15:35.700 --> 03:15:39.000]   it says nothing about what they ate before.
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.460]   And in that timeframe,
[03:15:41.460 --> 03:15:43.700]   what's the likelihood people are gonna have heart attacks
[03:15:43.700 --> 03:15:45.580]   or some sort of myocardial infarction?
[03:15:45.580 --> 03:15:47.420]   It's pretty low.
[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:51.220]   Now that we have all these data banks of blood samples
[03:15:51.220 --> 03:15:53.140]   and whatnot from people from all these old studies,
[03:15:53.140 --> 03:15:54.940]   they go back and do these analyses.
[03:15:54.940 --> 03:15:59.140]   And when they look at LDL cholesterol and plot it,
[03:15:59.140 --> 03:16:01.440]   so lifetime exposure to LDL cholesterol,
[03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:04.660]   and plot it against the risk of heart disease,
[03:16:04.660 --> 03:16:07.280]   I mean, you can pretty much draw a straight line through it.
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:11.480]   And so to me, that's pretty strong evidence.
[03:16:11.480 --> 03:16:13.540]   If you wanna apply the same logic of,
[03:16:13.540 --> 03:16:15.000]   well, we have this,
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:18.040]   and LDL, by the way, can cause inflammation
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:19.240]   in the endothelium.
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:20.840]   So you have that damage to it
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:23.160]   because of the apolipoprotein,
[03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:24.960]   that attracts inflammatory markers.
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:28.000]   So people are getting some of this cart before the horse.
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:29.280]   And then the other thing that sealed it for me
[03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:31.120]   was again, like HDL.
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:33.360]   They looked at the same thing at HDL.
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:35.800]   Turns out HDL is just kind of a marker of metabolic health.
[03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:36.920]   It's good to have high HDL,
[03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:40.440]   but HDL itself doesn't appear to be protective
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:42.480]   because if they raise it with drugs
[03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:45.360]   or look at people who secrete more or less,
[03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:47.640]   it doesn't seem to independently modulate
[03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:48.880]   risk of cardiovascular disease.
[03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:51.480]   So all that to say,
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:55.640]   saturated fat is really only an issue,
[03:16:55.640 --> 03:16:58.720]   I would say, for the LDL,
[03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:00.280]   the fact that it can raise LDL.
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:03.760]   And there is some evidence
[03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:05.820]   it's not necessarily good for the gut microbiome
[03:17:05.820 --> 03:17:08.320]   because the bile salt in products
[03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:10.360]   from emulsifying saturated fat,
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:11.960]   'cause it requires more bile,
[03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:13.280]   that those might be toxic
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:16.040]   to some beneficial species of bacteria.
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:16.880]   But here's what I'm not saying.
[03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:19.240]   I'm not saying don't eat any saturated fat.
[03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:20.680]   What I'm saying is, again,
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:23.260]   your overall diet quality is what matters.
[03:17:23.260 --> 03:17:26.680]   I think it's fine to have some saturated fat.
[03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:28.800]   I think probably try to keep below
[03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:31.700]   seven to 10% of your daily calorie intake.
[03:17:31.700 --> 03:17:34.040]   What also matters is there's no solutions, only trade-offs.
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:36.420]   And so if somebody says to me,
[03:17:36.420 --> 03:17:40.480]   I was able to lose 50 pounds on low carb
[03:17:40.480 --> 03:17:43.480]   and everything got better, but my LDL went up a little bit.
[03:17:43.480 --> 03:17:46.800]   And they felt like that was the only thing
[03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:47.960]   they were able to be consistent with,
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:51.440]   I'd say on balance, they're probably better off
[03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:53.800]   with that slightly elevated LDL
[03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:56.700]   than they would be if they kept the 50 pounds on.
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:18:00.600]   Now, I would argue if they had lost the 50 pounds
[03:18:00.600 --> 03:18:02.660]   and lowered their LDL,
[03:18:02.660 --> 03:18:05.600]   their overall risk would be lower than it is now.
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:06.760]   But again, we have to look at
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:08.320]   what can somebody consistently execute.
[03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:10.120]   So all that to say,
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:12.360]   I'm not saying you should consume seed oils.
[03:18:12.360 --> 03:18:14.400]   I'm not saying that there's no negative downsides,
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:16.320]   but if we look at comparing it
[03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:18.760]   to a comparable molecule of saturated fat,
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:20.500]   there's a much more compelling argument
[03:18:20.500 --> 03:18:23.440]   that saturated fat is bad for you versus seed oils.
[03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:27.700]   - Thank you for that very thorough and very clear answer.
[03:18:27.700 --> 03:18:31.920]   And I just will highlight that you ate a steak last night.
[03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:35.000]   So you were by no means anti-meat or saturated fat.
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:36.520]   - I ate a steak right in front of a vegan.
[03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:39.720]   - Okay, not to aggravate them,
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:42.100]   just because they stuck to their principles,
[03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:42.940]   you stuck to yours.
[03:18:42.940 --> 03:18:44.280]   - I was originally going to order fish and they said,
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:45.440]   "It's okay if you want to get a steak."
[03:18:45.440 --> 03:18:47.380]   And I said, "Okay, if you say so."
[03:18:47.380 --> 03:18:50.520]   Now they did make a couple of comments in jest
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:51.840]   during the meal.
[03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:53.760]   - Fair enough, fair enough.
[03:18:53.760 --> 03:18:56.440]   Let's talk about artificial sweeteners.
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:18:57.280]   - Sweet.
[03:18:57.280 --> 03:19:00.720]   Those are the other people that pay me.
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:01.840]   - That's right.
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:02.720]   He's kidding, folks.
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:03.800]   Good goodness.
[03:19:03.800 --> 03:19:06.480]   - Yeah, I got to be careful about that.
[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:09.320]   You and I got into a, it wasn't a scrap.
[03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:12.360]   We got into a little disagreement about this years ago.
[03:19:12.360 --> 03:19:14.560]   So long ago that it's probably not even worth mentioning
[03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:17.160]   that, you know, I was somewhat enticed
[03:19:17.160 --> 03:19:19.080]   by the data from Dana Small's laboratory,
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:21.880]   then at Yale, I think now she's up at McGill,
[03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:24.480]   looking at some kind of Pavlovian conditioning
[03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:25.760]   of artificial sweeteners.
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:30.760]   So basically children in that case consuming a high amount
[03:19:33.960 --> 03:19:37.640]   of, I think it was either sucralose or saccharin
[03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:42.040]   in combination with a meal, kind of standard meal,
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:44.440]   and look at the insulin response.
[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:48.200]   And then removing the food component sometime later.
[03:19:48.200 --> 03:19:50.220]   And what they essentially observed
[03:19:50.220 --> 03:19:52.840]   was a conditioned insulin response.
[03:19:52.840 --> 03:19:55.600]   So then you then have these kids just have
[03:19:55.600 --> 03:20:00.600]   the sweet tasting non-caloric drink minus the food.
[03:20:00.600 --> 03:20:03.640]   And they then saw an elevated insulin response.
[03:20:03.640 --> 03:20:05.820]   In other words, the same way that Pavlov got dogs
[03:20:05.820 --> 03:20:08.800]   to salivate in response to a bell that was paired with food,
[03:20:08.800 --> 03:20:11.320]   then you remove the food and then they just simply salivate
[03:20:11.320 --> 03:20:12.240]   in response to the bell.
[03:20:12.240 --> 03:20:15.120]   The idea was, well, maybe you can create
[03:20:15.120 --> 03:20:17.400]   a conditioned Pavlovian like response
[03:20:17.400 --> 03:20:18.600]   to artificial sweeteners.
[03:20:18.600 --> 03:20:20.620]   Okay, I thought it was kind of a cool study.
[03:20:20.620 --> 03:20:23.160]   Looking back, I probably wouldn't have covered it
[03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:26.620]   the way I did because it's not a typical scenario.
[03:20:26.620 --> 03:20:30.000]   I think the more important questions are,
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:34.400]   is there any evidence that artificial and low calorie
[03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:36.560]   or zero calorie sweeteners like Stevia,
[03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:37.960]   we have to be very careful here.
[03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:39.400]   - No. - Not all artificial.
[03:20:39.400 --> 03:20:42.200]   - That they are somehow dangerous
[03:20:42.200 --> 03:20:43.440]   in any of the following ways.
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:47.840]   One, do they alone increase insulin
[03:20:47.840 --> 03:20:50.060]   to levels that are problematic?
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:53.640]   Two, do they stimulate appetite
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:56.260]   in a way that's problematic, independent of insulin,
[03:20:56.260 --> 03:20:58.560]   or maybe as a consequence of insulin?
[03:20:58.560 --> 03:21:01.480]   And then three, what's the story with their potential effect
[03:21:01.480 --> 03:21:02.760]   on the gut microbiome?
[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:04.560]   I think those are the three categories that come to mind.
[03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:05.600]   There are probably other categories.
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:08.240]   And I just want to say for the record, then and now,
[03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:11.200]   I'll consume some aspartame every once in a while
[03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:12.240]   in the form of a Diet Coke.
[03:21:12.240 --> 03:21:14.460]   Stevia seems to be in a lot of the things that I consume
[03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:16.520]   and I don't have a problem with that.
[03:21:16.520 --> 03:21:20.000]   So I'm not anti artificial or low calorie sweetener.
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:23.200]   Although for reasons that are entirely personal
[03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:25.280]   and have no scientific basis whatsoever,
[03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:27.800]   I avoid things with sucralose in them.
[03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:29.200]   I don't really like the taste of it
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:31.480]   and I have kind of an aversion to it
[03:21:31.480 --> 03:21:32.740]   for uninteresting reasons.
[03:21:32.740 --> 03:21:36.320]   - And that's a great way to couch that of,
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:37.840]   I don't have data for this.
[03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:38.840]   Personally, I don't do it.
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:40.600]   - Yeah, if I see something, I'm like, yeah, no.
[03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:41.520]   Aspartame, fine.
[03:21:41.520 --> 03:21:43.480]   Stevia gets the thumbs up by me.
[03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:48.680]   And I will choose low calorie or zero calorie sodas
[03:21:48.680 --> 03:21:50.200]   or drinks or energy drinks
[03:21:50.200 --> 03:21:54.160]   when I have the option to have something with sugar.
[03:21:54.160 --> 03:21:56.520]   It's just kind of, but I'm not anti sugar either.
[03:21:56.520 --> 03:21:58.880]   I just developed this as a habit.
[03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:01.400]   Yeah, I prefer to get my calories from food.
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:03.240]   - Yeah, you'd prefer to have a steak
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:05.880]   as opposed to having the cola.
[03:22:05.880 --> 03:22:08.820]   - Right, steak, strawberries, blueberries, oatmeal, rice,
[03:22:08.820 --> 03:22:11.000]   butter, olive oil, and all the other delicious,
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.200]   wonderful things, as opposed to a Coke.
[03:22:13.200 --> 03:22:15.520]   I'd rather just have a diet Coke and eat a bit more steak.
[03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:18.320]   - So let's take the insulin thing first.
[03:22:18.320 --> 03:22:20.920]   So interesting mechanism that they're showing there.
[03:22:20.920 --> 03:22:24.680]   What I would say is there's been a couple of meta-analyses
[03:22:24.680 --> 03:22:27.600]   now looking at different non-nutritive sweeteners
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:30.080]   and their effects on insulin, and they don't show an effect.
[03:22:30.080 --> 03:22:33.440]   So there's no real effect in it.
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:36.660]   Let's just kind of play it out logically a little bit.
[03:22:36.660 --> 03:22:38.840]   If there was a significant effect on insulin,
[03:22:38.840 --> 03:22:41.040]   one of two things is gonna happen.
[03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:42.440]   You're gonna see a drop in blood sugar
[03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:43.960]   'cause you're not eating anything, right?
[03:22:43.960 --> 03:22:48.260]   So most of us, if we drink a diet soda,
[03:22:48.260 --> 03:22:51.920]   we don't then go hypoglycemic, right?
[03:22:51.920 --> 03:22:54.300]   Or if there is an increase in insulin,
[03:22:54.300 --> 03:22:57.880]   if blood glucose isn't dropping,
[03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:00.760]   then there must be a corresponding increase in glucagon,
[03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:03.120]   which is basically offsetting all of insulin's issues.
[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:04.400]   I don't think either of those things happen.
[03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:07.500]   I think it's inert, and the research,
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:09.800]   the meta-analyses tend to show this.
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:12.360]   There was a, I'm thinking of two meta-analyses
[03:23:12.360 --> 03:23:14.480]   where they looked at these, they looked at glycemia,
[03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:16.240]   they looked at insulin sensitivity,
[03:23:16.240 --> 03:23:17.160]   and they looked at insulin release,
[03:23:17.160 --> 03:23:19.920]   and they just didn't see any effect.
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:24.120]   Now, when it comes to, what was the second point?
[03:23:24.120 --> 03:23:27.520]   - So we have insulin, we have does it stimulate appetite
[03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:30.280]   in ways that may or may not be related to insulin?
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:31.720]   You ruled out insulin increase.
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:34.820]   So like, could there be a pairing of like,
[03:23:34.820 --> 03:23:38.080]   okay, every time I eat, I have a diet soda.
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:40.240]   Then if I have a diet soda on its own,
[03:23:40.240 --> 03:23:42.360]   does it stimulate the desire to eat,
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:44.120]   a la the Dana Small study?
[03:23:44.120 --> 03:23:46.720]   And by the way, that study was halted.
[03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:48.080]   This is the problem with that study
[03:23:48.080 --> 03:23:49.640]   is it was being done in kids.
[03:23:49.640 --> 03:23:51.600]   The increases in insulin that they saw
[03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:54.040]   in a subset of the kids were so dramatic.
[03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:55.560]   This is the way she described it in a talk,
[03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:56.880]   so I feel comfortable saying this.
[03:23:56.880 --> 03:23:57.860]   Maybe she's changed her tune,
[03:23:57.860 --> 03:24:00.160]   but in this online talk, an academic talk,
[03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:03.120]   the increases in insulin were so dramatic
[03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:04.960]   that they were concerned about the kids
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:06.920]   becoming pre-diabetic, so they halted the study,
[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:09.760]   which means the totality of the data never came in,
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:12.600]   means that it's hard to draw a conclusion.
[03:24:12.600 --> 03:24:14.100]   - Okay, when we talk about studies,
[03:24:14.100 --> 03:24:16.280]   we're always talking about means and averages, right?
[03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:18.680]   I leave open the idea that there could be
[03:24:18.680 --> 03:24:20.320]   subsets of populations,
[03:24:20.320 --> 03:24:22.000]   that there could be individual responses.
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:24.120]   I leave all that open.
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:28.040]   So on average, if that's true,
[03:24:28.040 --> 03:24:31.280]   and there is a conditioned response,
[03:24:31.280 --> 03:24:34.280]   we're worried about, well, one,
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:35.520]   is there an effect on appetite,
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:36.920]   where people are gonna eat more,
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:38.400]   even if those things don't have calories,
[03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:39.240]   they're not gonna make you fat,
[03:24:39.240 --> 03:24:40.360]   there's no insulin release.
[03:24:40.360 --> 03:24:42.820]   Okay, they're stimulating you to eat more.
[03:24:42.820 --> 03:24:46.200]   Well, if we look at the randomized control trials
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:48.680]   where they tell people, hey, instead of regular cola,
[03:24:48.680 --> 03:24:50.540]   drink diet cola.
[03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:53.460]   If that was true, an actual outcome,
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:55.560]   we would see people on diet soda
[03:24:55.560 --> 03:24:58.000]   either not lose weight or gain weight,
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:24:59.960]   definitely compared to water,
[03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:02.780]   and probably similar compared to a regular cola,
[03:25:02.780 --> 03:25:03.620]   maybe a little bit less,
[03:25:03.620 --> 03:25:05.400]   but we would expect to see weight gain.
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:06.880]   We actually see the exact opposite thing.
[03:25:06.880 --> 03:25:09.860]   So we have several randomized control trials now
[03:25:09.860 --> 03:25:14.860]   where people comparing not just diet soda,
[03:25:15.620 --> 03:25:16.620]   I don't wanna just say diet soda,
[03:25:16.620 --> 03:25:18.920]   a lot of them are low, no calorie beverages
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:20.680]   is kind of what they talk about,
[03:25:20.680 --> 03:25:22.880]   'cause not everything's technically diet soda,
[03:25:22.880 --> 03:25:26.360]   but I think people know diet drinks in particular.
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:29.160]   Where they're comparing them,
[03:25:29.160 --> 03:25:32.720]   they tell people either have cola,
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:37.400]   either have diet soda, or sorry, diet drink,
[03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:38.900]   or just use water.
[03:25:38.900 --> 03:25:44.560]   Now, they absolutely, every single one of these trials,
[03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:48.180]   they lose weight going to diet drinks,
[03:25:48.180 --> 03:25:49.700]   usually a pretty significant amount of weight.
[03:25:49.700 --> 03:25:51.300]   - Yeah, and usually, as I recall,
[03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:54.380]   pretty significant amount of diet drink,
[03:25:54.380 --> 03:25:55.820]   like two liters a day even,
[03:25:55.820 --> 03:25:57.340]   like the person will carry around a liter
[03:25:57.340 --> 03:25:59.580]   or a two liter of diet drink
[03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:02.060]   and sip on it whenever they get thirsty or hungry.
[03:26:02.060 --> 03:26:03.060]   - Yep. - Yeah.
[03:26:03.060 --> 03:26:05.380]   - So then what's been interesting
[03:26:05.380 --> 03:26:08.600]   is they've done direct comparisons to water,
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:10.960]   and some studies don't really show a difference,
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:13.620]   but several studies and several meta-analyses now
[03:26:13.620 --> 03:26:16.460]   have shown that when people,
[03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:20.560]   if they have either them use water in place of regular soda
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:22.700]   or diet drinks in place of regular soda,
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:24.660]   the people actually lose a little bit more weight,
[03:26:24.660 --> 03:26:27.460]   and it's statistically significant with the diet drinks.
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:32.060]   Now, I don't think diet drinks are fat burners, okay?
[03:26:32.060 --> 03:26:33.000]   They're not causing you
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.220]   to have increased energy expenditure,
[03:26:35.220 --> 03:26:39.900]   but if you are somebody who is used to a sweet taste,
[03:26:39.900 --> 03:26:42.620]   if you switch to water,
[03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:45.300]   perhaps you're seeking out that sweetness elsewhere,
[03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:46.700]   and so maybe those people are consuming
[03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:49.060]   a little bit more sweet food or whatnot,
[03:26:49.060 --> 03:26:51.180]   whereas in the diet drink group,
[03:26:51.180 --> 03:26:53.540]   maybe that's filled that sweet taste for them.
[03:26:53.540 --> 03:26:55.700]   So I don't get into the,
[03:26:55.700 --> 03:26:56.540]   again, this gets,
[03:26:56.540 --> 03:26:58.180]   like people get very like ethically charged
[03:26:58.180 --> 03:26:59.660]   about what's wrong with drinking water.
[03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:01.100]   There's nothing wrong with drinking water.
[03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:03.380]   If you can drink water, you feel satiated,
[03:27:03.380 --> 03:27:04.300]   and you maintain your body.
[03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:06.020]   - I'm just chuckling 'cause if drinking water
[03:27:06.020 --> 03:27:08.820]   becomes an issue online, then I might quit.
[03:27:08.820 --> 03:27:09.660]   - No, no, it already has, it already has.
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:10.680]   - All right, well, I'm not quitting,
[03:27:10.680 --> 03:27:12.420]   but that's ridiculous.
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:17.300]   - Yeah, well, so again, perhaps that mechanism exists,
[03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:19.340]   but at least on average,
[03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:23.300]   it's obviously washed out by the fact that
[03:27:23.300 --> 03:27:27.220]   for whatever reason, for most people who do this,
[03:27:27.220 --> 03:27:30.880]   they get a little bit more satiety
[03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:33.700]   out of consuming a diet beverage
[03:27:33.700 --> 03:27:35.760]   as opposed to substituting water for a beverage.
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:39.100]   Now, again, if you're somebody who you can drink water
[03:27:39.100 --> 03:27:41.140]   and you don't have an inclination for diet drinks,
[03:27:41.140 --> 03:27:42.300]   then don't do it.
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:43.980]   You don't need it.
[03:27:43.980 --> 03:27:48.980]   But again, I look at it as we need to lower the barriers
[03:27:48.980 --> 03:27:52.140]   for people to start getting healthy.
[03:27:52.140 --> 03:27:55.400]   And unfortunately, a lot of people with the message
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:27:58.220]   of just drink water, and they'll say,
[03:27:58.220 --> 03:28:01.380]   well, diet soda's just bad for you as regular soda,
[03:28:01.380 --> 03:28:03.380]   or it's worse for you than regular soda.
[03:28:03.380 --> 03:28:07.980]   Their intention might be, I just want people to drink water.
[03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:09.820]   But the outcome is people go,
[03:28:09.820 --> 03:28:11.260]   well, I can't imagine getting my soda,
[03:28:11.260 --> 03:28:14.020]   so I'm just gonna drink regular soda then, right?
[03:28:14.020 --> 03:28:16.900]   And so while your intention was positive,
[03:28:16.900 --> 03:28:19.780]   the outcome is actually kind of disastrous, right?
[03:28:19.780 --> 03:28:21.780]   And so we have to disconnect what the intentions
[03:28:21.780 --> 03:28:24.820]   of the message are from what it actually produces.
[03:28:24.820 --> 03:28:28.040]   And so that's why I say, hey, if we're moving levers,
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:30.740]   if somebody is obese and they came to me
[03:28:30.740 --> 03:28:33.820]   and they're like, well, I drink five colas a day,
[03:28:33.820 --> 03:28:35.740]   I'm like, fantastic,
[03:28:35.740 --> 03:28:39.140]   because I'm thinking five diet sodas instead,
[03:28:39.140 --> 03:28:41.980]   and now we have just saved 750 calories,
[03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:44.620]   and you're gonna start losing weight just by doing that,
[03:28:44.620 --> 03:28:46.660]   right, which again, people say,
[03:28:46.660 --> 03:28:49.340]   well, what about 100 years down the road or whatever?
[03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:51.660]   I'm like, well, most of these sweeteners
[03:28:51.660 --> 03:28:53.480]   have been around for decades now.
[03:28:53.480 --> 03:28:55.860]   We do have quite a bit of data on them.
[03:28:55.860 --> 03:28:57.500]   But let's say that there is something we don't want.
[03:28:57.500 --> 03:28:59.660]   Again, I'm shooting the alligator closest to the boat,
[03:28:59.660 --> 03:29:01.620]   right, like we know what obesity does.
[03:29:01.620 --> 03:29:05.300]   So, and people who do these diet drinks lose weight,
[03:29:05.300 --> 03:29:06.460]   they get more metabolically healthy.
[03:29:06.460 --> 03:29:11.460]   So again, if it comes down to soda or diet soda,
[03:29:11.460 --> 03:29:15.160]   by all means, let's do the diet soda.
[03:29:15.160 --> 03:29:17.960]   And if there's some small negative effects to it,
[03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:19.080]   we'll deal with them.
[03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:21.200]   So that brings me to the gut microbiome.
[03:29:21.200 --> 03:29:24.400]   Most of the research studies in humans
[03:29:24.400 --> 03:29:26.360]   where they use reasonable doses
[03:29:26.360 --> 03:29:28.260]   don't really show much effect on the gut microbiome.
[03:29:28.260 --> 03:29:31.420]   However, there are a few with particular sweeteners
[03:29:31.420 --> 03:29:33.760]   like sucralose that do show an effect.
[03:29:33.760 --> 03:29:35.400]   Now, there was one that got a lot of play
[03:29:35.400 --> 03:29:36.720]   and you and I actually talked about this.
[03:29:36.720 --> 03:29:39.260]   I think we actually talked on the phone about this.
[03:29:39.260 --> 03:29:41.000]   And it was an interesting study.
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:42.120]   I thought it was well done,
[03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:46.200]   but I want to be careful about how overgeneralized it was.
[03:29:46.200 --> 03:29:49.440]   So the first part is in this study,
[03:29:49.440 --> 03:29:52.920]   they selected for people who basically,
[03:29:52.920 --> 03:29:55.780]   they did a very, very like intense selection process
[03:29:55.780 --> 03:29:58.660]   where I think there was over 1500 people
[03:29:58.660 --> 03:30:01.840]   who were like originally included in the study
[03:30:01.840 --> 03:30:04.800]   and they whittled them down to like a hundred something.
[03:30:04.800 --> 03:30:06.960]   Because they wanted people
[03:30:06.960 --> 03:30:09.920]   who had really hardly ever used
[03:30:09.920 --> 03:30:12.080]   artificial sweeteners in their life.
[03:30:12.080 --> 03:30:14.520]   And that's a pretty small percentage of the population.
[03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:17.120]   What they found was a lot of people submitted saying,
[03:30:17.120 --> 03:30:18.760]   I don't use them, I've never used them.
[03:30:18.760 --> 03:30:20.520]   And then when they did dietary recall logs,
[03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:22.120]   like, oh, well, actually you're using it here
[03:30:22.120 --> 03:30:22.960]   and you're using it here.
[03:30:22.960 --> 03:30:24.800]   So they selected all these people out.
[03:30:24.800 --> 03:30:30.640]   And they found that when they gave them sucralose,
[03:30:30.640 --> 03:30:33.020]   that the composition of their gut microbiome changed
[03:30:33.020 --> 03:30:34.280]   and they called it dysbiosis.
[03:30:34.280 --> 03:30:35.400]   I'll come back to that
[03:30:35.400 --> 03:30:37.200]   'cause that's a scary sounding word.
[03:30:37.200 --> 03:30:41.020]   First off, what's interesting is,
[03:30:41.020 --> 03:30:44.520]   if you're somebody,
[03:30:44.520 --> 03:30:46.920]   that population that they're selecting,
[03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:47.920]   those are probably people
[03:30:47.920 --> 03:30:50.100]   who have been specifically trying to avoid them.
[03:30:50.100 --> 03:30:51.140]   Because if you're not,
[03:30:51.140 --> 03:30:55.320]   even if you don't try to consume them, they're everywhere.
[03:30:55.320 --> 03:30:57.480]   So if you haven't been consuming them,
[03:30:57.480 --> 03:30:59.800]   it's likely that you're specifically trying to avoid them,
[03:30:59.800 --> 03:31:02.480]   which probably means that you have negative thoughts
[03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:05.640]   and beliefs around artificial sweeteners.
[03:31:05.640 --> 03:31:07.880]   And again, we've discussed the power of belief before.
[03:31:07.880 --> 03:31:10.160]   I'm not saying it was a bad study because of that.
[03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:11.480]   I'm just saying we have to be careful
[03:31:11.480 --> 03:31:15.440]   about how much we over-interpret this research data.
[03:31:15.440 --> 03:31:17.920]   - Are you saying that the potential
[03:31:17.920 --> 03:31:21.240]   that those subjects had to believe
[03:31:21.240 --> 03:31:25.160]   that zero calorie sweeteners or low calorie sweeteners
[03:31:25.160 --> 03:31:26.400]   could be bad for their microbiome
[03:31:26.400 --> 03:31:30.080]   might've actually made their gut microbiome more dysbiotic?
[03:31:30.080 --> 03:31:30.920]   - Maybe.
[03:31:30.920 --> 03:31:32.200]   I mean, again, we've talked about
[03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:33.400]   the power of belief is very powerful.
[03:31:33.400 --> 03:31:36.720]   Now, I have no way to support that, right?
[03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:39.400]   I'm just saying, be careful before we over-generalize.
[03:31:39.400 --> 03:31:41.520]   Plus it was a two week study and-
[03:31:41.520 --> 03:31:42.560]   - Just two weeks?
[03:31:42.560 --> 03:31:43.760]   - Yes, it was two weeks.
[03:31:43.760 --> 03:31:47.720]   Now again, two weeks is enough time
[03:31:47.720 --> 03:31:49.240]   to show differences in the gut microbiome.
[03:31:49.240 --> 03:31:51.280]   Actually, a few days is typically enough time.
[03:31:51.280 --> 03:31:52.440]   - And only for sucralose.
[03:31:52.440 --> 03:31:54.560]   So Stevia, no change.
[03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:57.720]   - There was another sweetener that I think had a change.
[03:31:57.720 --> 03:31:58.880]   It might've been saccharin.
[03:31:58.880 --> 03:32:00.480]   - Saccharin and sucralose are the ones
[03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:04.400]   that seem to always show the biggest effects, quote unquote.
[03:32:04.400 --> 03:32:07.200]   And I don't know how often those are used
[03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:09.680]   in diet drinks these days.
[03:32:09.680 --> 03:32:10.600]   I mean, less and less.
[03:32:10.600 --> 03:32:12.680]   I mean, it's usually aspartame, Stevia,
[03:32:12.680 --> 03:32:16.640]   more in the kind of wellness, health, fitness crowd drinks.
[03:32:16.640 --> 03:32:18.160]   - Sucralose is pretty ubiquitous
[03:32:18.160 --> 03:32:19.680]   in a lot of diet products and whatnot.
[03:32:19.680 --> 03:32:24.480]   But like being frank, my whey protein powder
[03:32:24.480 --> 03:32:26.400]   with outward nutrition is sweetened with sucralose.
[03:32:26.400 --> 03:32:28.000]   I mean, it's a great sweetener.
[03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:30.560]   And so some people will take that as well.
[03:32:30.560 --> 03:32:31.960]   Of course, he's gonna defend sucralose
[03:32:31.960 --> 03:32:32.800]   'cause it's in his protein.
[03:32:32.800 --> 03:32:34.440]   But if I thought it was really bad,
[03:32:34.440 --> 03:32:36.480]   I would just use a different sweetener.
[03:32:36.480 --> 03:32:41.480]   So what I will say as well is gut dysbiosis sounds bad,
[03:32:41.480 --> 03:32:45.060]   but it simply means that the gut microbiome changed.
[03:32:45.060 --> 03:32:50.000]   And I have several friends who are gut microbiome experts.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:52.060]   And they'll, when we sit down and talk about this stuff,
[03:32:52.060 --> 03:32:54.560]   they're like, I mean, their takeaway is,
[03:32:54.560 --> 03:32:55.720]   yeah, in like 50 years,
[03:32:55.720 --> 03:32:57.840]   we'll probably have a really good idea of this stuff.
[03:32:57.840 --> 03:33:00.840]   But right now, we just know that certain things change it.
[03:33:00.840 --> 03:33:05.300]   We don't really know like if it's a good change, bad change.
[03:33:05.300 --> 03:33:07.380]   So I'll give an example.
[03:33:07.380 --> 03:33:09.760]   There was another study that did show
[03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:12.160]   a gut microbiome shift with sucralose.
[03:33:12.160 --> 03:33:14.360]   And they showed some of the species of bacteria
[03:33:14.360 --> 03:33:16.360]   that were increased or decreased.
[03:33:16.360 --> 03:33:18.360]   And one of the species that was increased,
[03:33:18.360 --> 03:33:21.200]   I believe, I'm gonna butcher this so badly.
[03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:25.320]   I think it was Blaudia coccoides was the name of it,
[03:33:25.320 --> 03:33:27.320]   or at least how I tried to read it, right?
[03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:29.640]   'Cause these are very like strange Latin words.
[03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:31.240]   - Yeah, the names of bacteria
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:34.120]   are really difficult to pronounce.
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:38.960]   - Now, what's interesting is this species of bacteria
[03:33:38.960 --> 03:33:41.560]   was associated with better metabolic health,
[03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:46.280]   lower risk of obesity, better insulin sensitivity.
[03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:50.080]   And so I kind of walked away saying,
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:51.560]   well, couldn't you make the argument
[03:33:51.560 --> 03:33:53.840]   that sucralose actually changed the gut microbiome
[03:33:53.840 --> 03:33:56.160]   for the better based on some of this data?
[03:33:56.160 --> 03:33:59.080]   And so I'm not saying that.
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:01.380]   What I'm saying is the following.
[03:34:01.380 --> 03:34:05.840]   We don't really know if that change to the gut microbiome
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:08.720]   is a good change, bad change, or neutral.
[03:34:08.720 --> 03:34:10.940]   We just know that it changes.
[03:34:10.940 --> 03:34:13.960]   So if you want to avoid, fine.
[03:34:13.960 --> 03:34:17.560]   But if you're somebody who really struggles
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:21.440]   with moderating your intake and a sucralose is,
[03:34:21.440 --> 03:34:23.580]   or an aspartame or whatever have you,
[03:34:24.600 --> 03:34:27.000]   helps you moderate that intake,
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:28.280]   then again, you're shooting the alligator
[03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:29.720]   closest to the boat.
[03:34:29.720 --> 03:34:32.040]   Let's focus on the big stuff, right?
[03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:34.480]   And that's kind of where I land.
[03:34:34.480 --> 03:34:38.640]   And again, I hold open that perhaps my mind
[03:34:38.640 --> 03:34:41.720]   will change and adjust.
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:44.400]   But sucralose has been around a long time.
[03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:46.160]   The other thing people bring up is cancer.
[03:34:46.160 --> 03:34:48.920]   They'll bring up cancer with artificial sweeteners.
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:52.080]   I'll give you an example why I'm not worried about this.
[03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:54.640]   First off, you have to keep in mind
[03:34:54.640 --> 03:34:57.220]   that negativity bias in the news, all right?
[03:34:57.220 --> 03:35:01.000]   Things that are negative are much more likely
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:03.520]   to get play than things that are positive, okay?
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:06.720]   Think about how much you hear about this causes cancer,
[03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:08.120]   this causes heart diseases,
[03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:09.800]   versus this protects against this,
[03:35:09.800 --> 03:35:11.160]   this protects against this.
[03:35:11.160 --> 03:35:15.040]   - It's also safer to when the media warns people off things
[03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:16.400]   as opposed to towards things,
[03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:18.960]   because if they push people towards things,
[03:35:18.960 --> 03:35:20.360]   there's more liability.
[03:35:20.360 --> 03:35:21.200]   - Right.
[03:35:21.200 --> 03:35:22.200]   - Away from things,
[03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:25.960]   rarely are they responsible for the opportunity cost there
[03:35:25.960 --> 03:35:28.120]   or the trade-off as you referred to it.
[03:35:28.120 --> 03:35:32.760]   - Right, so you hear a lot,
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:33.600]   people are like, oh man,
[03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:35.360]   all these studies say that these cause cancer.
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:38.240]   So again, I'm gonna give a shout out to Consensus,
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:41.320]   'cause it's a great AI tool that basically will give you,
[03:35:41.320 --> 03:35:43.140]   like if you ask it a question,
[03:35:43.140 --> 03:35:45.360]   and there's some filters that help with that,
[03:35:45.360 --> 03:35:47.100]   it will give you kind of like,
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:48.500]   this percentage of studies say yes,
[03:35:48.500 --> 03:35:49.740]   this percentage say possibly,
[03:35:49.740 --> 03:35:51.180]   and this percentage say no.
[03:35:51.180 --> 03:35:52.220]   - I've used it a little bit.
[03:35:52.220 --> 03:35:53.380]   - Yeah. - It's a great tool.
[03:35:53.380 --> 03:35:56.140]   - And if you type in, does aspartame cause cancer,
[03:35:56.140 --> 03:35:59.620]   for example, 80% say no.
[03:35:59.620 --> 03:36:02.860]   And then like, I think the split is like 13% say possibly
[03:36:02.860 --> 03:36:03.900]   and 7% say yes, right?
[03:36:03.900 --> 03:36:04.780]   But you would never know that
[03:36:04.780 --> 03:36:08.340]   from like listening to social media, watching the news.
[03:36:08.340 --> 03:36:10.680]   But I wanna point out one study in particular
[03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:14.540]   that did show an association of aspartame intake with cancer.
[03:36:14.540 --> 03:36:16.260]   And it was from the Nutrisanti cohort,
[03:36:16.260 --> 03:36:17.420]   I think that was out of France,
[03:36:17.420 --> 03:36:19.100]   like 100,000 people.
[03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:22.740]   And they looked at like people who didn't use it
[03:36:22.740 --> 03:36:25.020]   versus people who were like low-moderate users
[03:36:25.020 --> 03:36:26.400]   and then people who were like high users,
[03:36:26.400 --> 03:36:28.800]   they categorized them to tertiles.
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:33.800]   And between the non-users and the low-moderate users,
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:36.020]   there was like a,
[03:36:36.020 --> 03:36:38.960]   I believe it was like a 15-ish percent
[03:36:38.960 --> 03:36:41.940]   relative risk increase in cancer incidents.
[03:36:41.940 --> 03:36:45.880]   And that's what got reported in the news.
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:50.220]   And then that dropped to like a 6% increase risk
[03:36:50.220 --> 03:36:51.380]   in the high group.
[03:36:51.380 --> 03:36:54.420]   So it did this,
[03:36:54.420 --> 03:36:57.220]   which I'm not aware of any carcinogens
[03:36:57.220 --> 03:37:02.220]   that they actually decrease in terms of the risks,
[03:37:02.220 --> 03:37:08.020]   like carcinogenesis as they go up in like the concentration.
[03:37:08.020 --> 03:37:11.580]   And so to me, you know,
[03:37:11.580 --> 03:37:12.980]   one of the things you've got to realize,
[03:37:12.980 --> 03:37:14.780]   my PhD advisor used to say,
[03:37:14.780 --> 03:37:16.420]   "If you torture the data enough,
[03:37:16.420 --> 03:37:18.960]   it will confess what you want it to say."
[03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:23.960]   And so if you go through a large group of people
[03:37:23.960 --> 03:37:27.200]   and you start trying to associate things with other things,
[03:37:27.200 --> 03:37:28.140]   you'll find things,
[03:37:28.140 --> 03:37:29.020]   but you gotta be very careful
[03:37:29.020 --> 03:37:30.780]   with how strongly you interpret it.
[03:37:30.780 --> 03:37:33.620]   And so for me, again, if I'm feeling strongly about,
[03:37:33.620 --> 03:37:35.460]   for me to feel strong about something,
[03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:37.500]   there has to be some kind of dose response
[03:37:37.500 --> 03:37:40.060]   or at least like if there's a bell curve,
[03:37:40.060 --> 03:37:41.780]   sometimes you see that.
[03:37:41.780 --> 03:37:46.500]   But, you know, very rarely, especially with cancer stuff,
[03:37:46.500 --> 03:37:49.020]   usually this is kind of a linear effect.
[03:37:49.020 --> 03:37:51.340]   And so again, that's where I land right now
[03:37:51.340 --> 03:37:52.280]   on artificial sweeteners.
[03:37:52.280 --> 03:37:56.100]   I land on them as a useful tool for a lot of people.
[03:37:56.100 --> 03:37:57.220]   I don't think they're magic.
[03:37:57.220 --> 03:37:59.900]   I think they occupy that sweet taste for a lot of people.
[03:37:59.900 --> 03:38:02.420]   And if you can completely avoid them and abstain from them
[03:38:02.420 --> 03:38:05.660]   and you're perfectly happy, then by all means do that.
[03:38:05.660 --> 03:38:08.360]   But if they help you maintain a healthy body weight,
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:09.660]   then by all means do that.
[03:38:10.620 --> 03:38:12.180]   - Love it.
[03:38:12.180 --> 03:38:13.260]   You've dealt with some injuries.
[03:38:13.260 --> 03:38:14.100]   You've dealt with pain.
[03:38:14.100 --> 03:38:17.740]   You talked a little bit about how reducing your stress
[03:38:17.740 --> 03:38:19.740]   and interpretation of the pain could help.
[03:38:19.740 --> 03:38:21.980]   I wanna talk about pain and pain management,
[03:38:21.980 --> 03:38:23.020]   but before we do that,
[03:38:23.020 --> 03:38:26.020]   a more general question that relates
[03:38:26.020 --> 03:38:27.880]   is about recovery tools.
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:30.140]   Many, many people want to know,
[03:38:30.140 --> 03:38:34.460]   okay, if we were to create the pyramid of the hierarchy
[03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:36.800]   of tools for recovery after training,
[03:38:36.800 --> 03:38:38.820]   and here let's change out
[03:38:38.820 --> 03:38:40.900]   or let's use resistance training
[03:38:40.900 --> 03:38:43.080]   and cardiovascular training interchangeably.
[03:38:43.080 --> 03:38:46.180]   Some people run hard, other people lift hard or do both.
[03:38:46.180 --> 03:38:49.460]   From the moment that session ends,
[03:38:49.460 --> 03:38:53.800]   what do you have in your kit of things to maximize recovery
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:38:56.400]   over the shortest possible amount of time?
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:39:00.500]   And I can immediately think of sleep as critical,
[03:39:00.500 --> 03:39:02.220]   but what are the things that you can do
[03:39:02.220 --> 03:39:05.720]   starting from that final repetition?
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:08.140]   - So I think it's not so time-dependent.
[03:39:08.140 --> 03:39:09.260]   Like I said, it's more about what you do
[03:39:09.260 --> 03:39:10.900]   over the course of 24 hours
[03:39:10.900 --> 03:39:12.620]   and on your day-to-day lifestyle.
[03:39:12.620 --> 03:39:17.220]   But sleep, as you said, also your nutrition,
[03:39:17.220 --> 03:39:18.740]   so being consistent with your nutrition.
[03:39:18.740 --> 03:39:21.860]   And you don't have to get in ultra-fast digesting,
[03:39:21.860 --> 03:39:26.260]   carbohydrate, and 50 grams of weight isolate
[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:27.940]   right after you eat.
[03:39:27.940 --> 03:39:30.100]   But it's probably a good idea within a couple hours
[03:39:30.100 --> 03:39:31.380]   of finishing your workout
[03:39:31.380 --> 03:39:34.660]   that you have a meal with high-quality protein
[03:39:34.660 --> 03:39:37.260]   and that you're just eating an overall healthy diet
[03:39:37.260 --> 03:39:38.220]   throughout the course of a day.
[03:39:38.220 --> 03:39:41.540]   And we've kind of discussed that at length.
[03:39:41.540 --> 03:39:43.540]   - You could do it immediately after your workout.
[03:39:43.540 --> 03:39:45.900]   - You can, yeah, you can, absolutely.
[03:39:45.900 --> 03:39:48.180]   - Quick, I'm going to layer in an additional question.
[03:39:48.180 --> 03:39:52.340]   Is there any evidence that fruit is not good
[03:39:52.340 --> 03:39:55.780]   at replenishing glycogen as compared to starch?
[03:39:55.780 --> 03:39:58.420]   Because the reason I ask this is that,
[03:39:58.420 --> 03:40:00.620]   like if I finish a workout and I have some,
[03:40:00.620 --> 03:40:02.660]   like a whey protein shake with a bunch of berries in it
[03:40:02.660 --> 03:40:05.580]   and a couple of bananas, assuming equal calories,
[03:40:05.580 --> 03:40:08.180]   is that going to replenish glycogen the same way
[03:40:08.180 --> 03:40:10.140]   as if I have a couple of scoops of whey protein
[03:40:10.140 --> 03:40:12.020]   and a bowl of oatmeal or rice?
[03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:13.780]   - This is going to circle back to our mechanism
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:14.820]   versus outcome.
[03:40:14.820 --> 03:40:17.980]   And this is one where I changed my mind
[03:40:17.980 --> 03:40:19.640]   because of seeing outcomes.
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:25.640]   So the reason this comes up is fructose,
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:31.440]   your muscles and other tissues lack the enzyme
[03:40:31.440 --> 03:40:34.660]   to turn fructose into muscle glycogen.
[03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:36.740]   Your liver has that enzyme.
[03:40:36.740 --> 03:40:38.140]   So your liver can take fructose
[03:40:38.140 --> 03:40:40.300]   and turn it into liver glycogen.
[03:40:40.300 --> 03:40:44.500]   So that has led some people in sports science
[03:40:44.500 --> 03:40:47.860]   or research to say, well, don't have fructose
[03:40:47.860 --> 03:40:48.700]   after a workout.
[03:40:48.700 --> 03:40:51.260]   And actually fructose is kind of a dead carbohydrate, right?
[03:40:51.260 --> 03:40:53.560]   'Cause it's not going to replenish muscle glycogen.
[03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:58.020]   And then I was reading a study from Tracy and Josh Anthony,
[03:40:58.020 --> 03:41:00.180]   which were, they came out of Lehman's lab
[03:41:00.180 --> 03:41:02.740]   and they actually are responsible for really flushing out
[03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:04.900]   a lot of the mTOR pathway,
[03:41:04.900 --> 03:41:07.460]   a lot of that translation initiation pathway.
[03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:09.740]   Very, very brilliant people.
[03:41:09.740 --> 03:41:11.620]   And I was glad I got to see them a few weeks ago
[03:41:11.620 --> 03:41:13.120]   when my advisor got his award.
[03:41:13.120 --> 03:41:16.140]   Tracy personally taught me how to Western blot.
[03:41:16.140 --> 03:41:17.900]   So thank you, Tracy.
[03:41:17.900 --> 03:41:20.380]   They did a study where they looked at glycogen replenishment
[03:41:20.380 --> 03:41:23.380]   after exercise, giving either sucrose,
[03:41:23.380 --> 03:41:27.680]   which is 50% glucose, 50% fructose or pure glucose.
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:31.380]   And actually, if I recall correctly,
[03:41:31.380 --> 03:41:33.500]   they actually got a little bit better muscle glycogen
[03:41:33.500 --> 03:41:35.780]   replenishment with sucrose.
[03:41:35.780 --> 03:41:38.860]   Now this, how do you explain it?
[03:41:38.860 --> 03:41:40.980]   That seems completely counterintuitive.
[03:41:40.980 --> 03:41:43.940]   And there, I believe,
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:45.540]   again, it's been some time since I read this paper,
[03:41:45.540 --> 03:41:47.900]   but I believe the explanation was
[03:41:47.900 --> 03:41:50.260]   by providing some fructose,
[03:41:50.260 --> 03:41:53.020]   what you're doing is you're kind of satiating
[03:41:53.020 --> 03:41:55.380]   the liver's need for glucose.
[03:41:55.380 --> 03:41:58.460]   And so that glucose that does come in from sucrose
[03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:00.620]   can then kind of just bypass the liver
[03:42:00.620 --> 03:42:02.540]   and be available for muscle.
[03:42:02.540 --> 03:42:04.840]   Whereas if you're getting pure glucose,
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:07.520]   the liver is gonna start picking things off.
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:09.020]   Now it wasn't, if I recall correctly,
[03:42:09.020 --> 03:42:09.900]   it wasn't a big difference
[03:42:09.900 --> 03:42:11.260]   in the rate of glycogen replenishment.
[03:42:11.260 --> 03:42:14.060]   But the other thing is people don't realize,
[03:42:14.060 --> 03:42:17.220]   well, even though fructose can't be used
[03:42:17.220 --> 03:42:20.060]   to replenish muscle glycogen directly,
[03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:22.500]   you forget about how the body operates
[03:42:22.500 --> 03:42:25.260]   in terms of whole body metabolism.
[03:42:25.260 --> 03:42:29.540]   And you can store fructose as glucose, glycogen,
[03:42:29.540 --> 03:42:32.740]   in the liver, and then the liver can release that glycogen
[03:42:32.740 --> 03:42:34.380]   at some point into the bloodstream,
[03:42:34.380 --> 03:42:37.180]   and then that can be taken up by the muscle
[03:42:37.180 --> 03:42:39.020]   and turned into muscle glycogen.
[03:42:39.020 --> 03:42:40.740]   So again, what it really boils down to
[03:42:40.740 --> 03:42:42.740]   is what are you doing on a 24-hour basis?
[03:42:42.740 --> 03:42:44.920]   And what I will say too is
[03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:46.900]   the rate of glycogen replenishment
[03:42:46.900 --> 03:42:49.220]   gets really tossed around a lot
[03:42:49.220 --> 03:42:50.720]   as something really important.
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:54.460]   For the most part, the rate isn't so important
[03:42:54.460 --> 03:42:55.880]   if you're eating enough total carbohydrate
[03:42:55.880 --> 03:42:58.220]   on a total daily basis and enough calories,
[03:42:58.220 --> 03:43:00.580]   you'll replenish your muscle glycogen.
[03:43:00.580 --> 03:43:02.680]   And most of these people, I always say,
[03:43:02.680 --> 03:43:05.100]   dude, you're weight training for an hour.
[03:43:05.100 --> 03:43:08.100]   You're gonna do it again in 23 hours.
[03:43:08.100 --> 03:43:10.140]   You got plenty of time to replenish that glycogen.
[03:43:10.140 --> 03:43:13.980]   You don't need cyclic dextrin or dextrose or whatever.
[03:43:13.980 --> 03:43:16.220]   And so I'm not really worried about that.
[03:43:16.220 --> 03:43:18.180]   I think where the rate of glycogen replenishment
[03:43:18.180 --> 03:43:20.140]   really matters is when you're dealing with athletes
[03:43:20.140 --> 03:43:22.980]   who have multiple events in a day, right?
[03:43:22.980 --> 03:43:26.220]   Where it is, they're gonna perform
[03:43:26.220 --> 03:43:28.820]   and then they need to replenish quickly
[03:43:28.820 --> 03:43:30.580]   before they go to the next event.
[03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:34.300]   Or people obviously doing endurance exercise
[03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:36.900]   where like Ironman's, triathlons and that sort of thing
[03:43:36.900 --> 03:43:41.900]   where getting in that replenishment
[03:43:41.900 --> 03:43:44.500]   and keeping it going is very important.
[03:43:44.500 --> 03:43:45.860]   But I think for the average person
[03:43:45.860 --> 03:43:48.980]   who's just exercising once a day, not really a big deal.
[03:43:48.980 --> 03:43:50.740]   Just make sure you're eating enough total carbohydrates.
[03:43:50.740 --> 03:43:53.680]   So for you, the berries and the fruits
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:57.040]   and the whey protein afterwards, excellent.
[03:43:57.040 --> 03:43:59.260]   - Okay, and then perhaps, and then typically I'll do a meal
[03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:01.620]   that includes some starch a little bit later in the day.
[03:44:01.620 --> 03:44:02.700]   - Yeah. - Great.
[03:44:02.700 --> 03:44:07.700]   So nutrition post-workout or in the hour or two post-workout
[03:44:07.700 --> 03:44:11.460]   making sure you eat enough in the following hours.
[03:44:11.460 --> 03:44:14.860]   Do you include any kind of stress down regulation?
[03:44:14.860 --> 03:44:17.900]   Are you, do you do anything else besides nutrition
[03:44:17.900 --> 03:44:20.220]   and sleep to accelerate recovery?
[03:44:20.220 --> 03:44:21.660]   - So stress management, like you said.
[03:44:21.660 --> 03:44:26.660]   So I am blessed enough that I currently live
[03:44:26.660 --> 03:44:29.660]   and home on Tampa Bay and I get to watch the sunset
[03:44:29.660 --> 03:44:30.820]   over the water every night.
[03:44:30.820 --> 03:44:35.400]   And that might say, that might seem like a weird thing
[03:44:35.400 --> 03:44:38.100]   but I really feel like that has helped with my stress level.
[03:44:38.100 --> 03:44:40.020]   - Viewing horizons, we know,
[03:44:40.020 --> 03:44:41.540]   just puts you into panoramic vision.
[03:44:41.540 --> 03:44:43.100]   We know this from stuff my lab has done.
[03:44:43.100 --> 03:44:44.300]   - This is right in your wheelhouse right here.
[03:44:44.300 --> 03:44:47.700]   - Oh yeah, panoramic vision is a, will, you know,
[03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:51.260]   come off the accelerator of the sympathetic arm
[03:44:51.260 --> 03:44:52.620]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[03:44:52.620 --> 03:44:53.980]   which is just nerd speak to say,
[03:44:53.980 --> 03:44:55.700]   enjoy those sunrises and sunsets.
[03:44:55.700 --> 03:44:56.540]   They are very calm.
[03:44:56.540 --> 03:44:58.660]   - I was talking to a friend of mine, we're sitting out.
[03:44:58.660 --> 03:44:59.900]   I said, well, you know,
[03:44:59.900 --> 03:45:02.420]   Andrew would approve of the sunset viewing.
[03:45:02.420 --> 03:45:04.900]   He might not approve of the bourbon I'm having with it, but.
[03:45:04.900 --> 03:45:06.380]   - You don't need my approval anyway.
[03:45:06.380 --> 03:45:09.100]   - So whatever, could you just slow down a little bit,
[03:45:09.100 --> 03:45:12.340]   you know, and just decompress and feel better.
[03:45:12.340 --> 03:45:14.540]   And so, I mean, another thing I'll do is I'll, you know,
[03:45:14.540 --> 03:45:16.140]   once the, if I had the kids, once I go to bed,
[03:45:16.140 --> 03:45:18.500]   I'll go downstairs and I'll lay on the couch with my cat
[03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:21.380]   and I'll play a video game, you know, just relax.
[03:45:21.380 --> 03:45:22.220]   - Yeah, decompress.
[03:45:22.220 --> 03:45:23.140]   - Just decompress, you know.
[03:45:23.140 --> 03:45:24.260]   - Things you enjoy.
[03:45:24.260 --> 03:45:27.260]   - Yeah, I think things you enjoy, like, obviously like,
[03:45:27.260 --> 03:45:28.540]   you can't drink a 12 pack of beer
[03:45:28.540 --> 03:45:31.420]   and have that be conducive to that sort of thing.
[03:45:31.420 --> 03:45:34.220]   But the other thing I will say is I think a lot of people
[03:45:34.220 --> 03:45:39.220]   focus too much, especially with resistance training,
[03:45:39.220 --> 03:45:43.580]   there's some evidence that being just overall
[03:45:43.580 --> 03:45:46.140]   active lifestyle, like going out,
[03:45:46.140 --> 03:45:47.900]   I remember when I was first getting into lifting,
[03:45:47.900 --> 03:45:49.540]   like back in the early 2000s, the guy's like,
[03:45:49.540 --> 03:45:51.740]   I go in and I lift and then I lay down the rest of the day.
[03:45:51.740 --> 03:45:54.060]   Right, 'cause I gotta recover, right?
[03:45:54.060 --> 03:45:56.380]   I think the research actually suggests
[03:45:56.380 --> 03:45:57.620]   that you're better off like having kind of
[03:45:57.620 --> 03:46:00.220]   an overall active lifestyle, you know, that,
[03:46:00.220 --> 03:46:01.840]   yeah, it's important to rest and recover,
[03:46:01.840 --> 03:46:03.640]   but it's probably important to move your body
[03:46:03.640 --> 03:46:04.500]   throughout the day.
[03:46:04.500 --> 03:46:08.280]   You know, active recovery does have some good data on it.
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:09.120]   - Awesome.
[03:46:09.120 --> 03:46:12.120]   Earlier, we were talking about protein.
[03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:13.780]   Actually, several times we talked about protein
[03:46:13.780 --> 03:46:16.620]   and I neglected to ask a question that is very timely
[03:46:16.620 --> 03:46:18.360]   because I just did an episode,
[03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:20.180]   a solo episode of this podcast recently
[03:46:20.180 --> 03:46:22.340]   about skin health and appearance.
[03:46:22.340 --> 03:46:26.020]   And I looked at the data on ingesting collagen.
[03:46:26.020 --> 03:46:28.780]   Could be from bone broth or other sources of collagen.
[03:46:28.780 --> 03:46:30.580]   Typically it's powdered collagens,
[03:46:30.580 --> 03:46:33.460]   anywhere from five to 30 grams of collagen.
[03:46:33.460 --> 03:46:36.340]   And I was kind of surprised at the results.
[03:46:36.340 --> 03:46:38.280]   I also talked to some dermatologists.
[03:46:38.280 --> 03:46:40.740]   Basically the results say in these papers,
[03:46:40.740 --> 03:46:43.880]   these meta, the meta analysis I looked at,
[03:46:43.880 --> 03:46:45.740]   and in speaking with these dermatologists
[03:46:45.740 --> 03:46:49.640]   that the conclusion was that regular consumption
[03:46:49.640 --> 03:46:51.300]   of collagen on the order of anywhere
[03:46:51.300 --> 03:46:53.020]   from five to 30 grams per day,
[03:46:53.020 --> 03:46:54.380]   with a little bit of vitamin C,
[03:46:54.380 --> 03:46:55.900]   a couple hundred milligrams of vitamin C
[03:46:55.900 --> 03:46:59.020]   for whatever pathway related reason,
[03:46:59.020 --> 03:47:02.340]   seemed to improve skin appearance.
[03:47:02.340 --> 03:47:04.060]   Fewer wrinkles, reduction in wrinkles,
[03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:06.900]   more skin tautness, appearance of moisture, et cetera.
[03:47:06.900 --> 03:47:08.540]   These are subjective measures, right?
[03:47:08.540 --> 03:47:10.180]   I don't think they were calibrating the skin
[03:47:10.180 --> 03:47:11.980]   and looking at tensile strength and things like that.
[03:47:11.980 --> 03:47:15.660]   But people felt they looked younger, et cetera.
[03:47:15.660 --> 03:47:18.980]   And I was surprised, really surprised,
[03:47:18.980 --> 03:47:22.740]   because without making this too long a question or story,
[03:47:22.740 --> 03:47:24.420]   a few years back, there were some claims
[03:47:24.420 --> 03:47:27.660]   by not-to-be-named individuals on Instagram saying,
[03:47:27.660 --> 03:47:29.500]   "Well, if you want to improve the function of your liver,
[03:47:29.500 --> 03:47:30.340]   "eat liver.
[03:47:30.340 --> 03:47:31.340]   "If you want to improve the function of your heart,
[03:47:31.340 --> 03:47:32.180]   "eat heart."
[03:47:32.180 --> 03:47:35.020]   If you want, and you and I were just like, "No."
[03:47:35.020 --> 03:47:36.780]   You're the nutrition biochemistry guy.
[03:47:36.780 --> 03:47:38.420]   I'm the neuroscience guy.
[03:47:38.420 --> 03:47:40.920]   I have a little bit of a background in cold physiology
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:43.380]   that I rarely talk about, but in any case.
[03:47:43.380 --> 03:47:44.220]   - But you know physiology.
[03:47:44.220 --> 03:47:46.500]   - Yeah, I mean, there is, we both agree,
[03:47:46.500 --> 03:47:49.460]   there's like zero evidence that ingesting a protein,
[03:47:49.460 --> 03:47:50.840]   which of course is broken down
[03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:53.700]   into its amino acid constituents in the gut,
[03:47:53.700 --> 03:47:56.340]   would somehow lead to selective shuttling
[03:47:56.340 --> 03:47:59.020]   of those amino acids from liver that you ingest
[03:47:59.020 --> 03:47:59.840]   to your liver.
[03:47:59.840 --> 03:48:01.740]   That just is like a, there's only one word for that.
[03:48:01.740 --> 03:48:04.620]   It's like a crazy unsubstantiated claim.
[03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:06.420]   And then some papers were sent my way,
[03:48:06.420 --> 03:48:07.820]   which were in a different language.
[03:48:07.820 --> 03:48:09.680]   And like, I was trying to, anyway,
[03:48:09.680 --> 03:48:12.700]   zero minus one evidence, as I would say.
[03:48:12.700 --> 03:48:16.220]   And yet the whole notion that consuming collagen protein,
[03:48:16.220 --> 03:48:17.860]   which Dr. Gabrielle Lyon told me
[03:48:17.860 --> 03:48:20.020]   is actually a pretty low quality protein
[03:48:20.020 --> 03:48:22.300]   on the kind of protein quality scale.
[03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:24.900]   It's like tendon and toenails and all this stuff, gross,
[03:48:24.900 --> 03:48:26.300]   but yeah, that's what it is.
[03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:30.380]   Somehow leads to improvements in actual collagen,
[03:48:30.380 --> 03:48:33.740]   which is of course is a native protein of the body.
[03:48:33.740 --> 03:48:34.560]   So I went digging.
[03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:37.000]   I just want to, before I get your answer,
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:38.940]   I went digging and I found, again,
[03:48:38.940 --> 03:48:41.420]   a not to be named individual has this kind of wild story
[03:48:41.420 --> 03:48:44.580]   on the internet that, ah, well, this is because
[03:48:44.580 --> 03:48:48.260]   it's broken down into the dipeptides and tripeptides
[03:48:48.260 --> 03:48:51.700]   in the gut that somehow inform the body
[03:48:51.700 --> 03:48:53.420]   that there's an injury in the collagen.
[03:48:53.420 --> 03:48:56.140]   And we have quote unquote, breakdown of collagen,
[03:48:56.140 --> 03:48:57.360]   AKA injury, I don't know,
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:00.000]   breakdown of collagen and elastin in the skin all the time.
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:02.820]   And then the body recognizes the presence
[03:49:02.820 --> 03:49:04.620]   of those dipeptides and tripeptides.
[03:49:04.620 --> 03:49:08.080]   So little groups of twos or three peptides, not just one,
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:10.760]   and sends those selectively to the skin.
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:12.400]   And so it's like, once again, it's like,
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:15.400]   it makes sense as a mechanism if it were true,
[03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:18.320]   but I just had to like roll my eyes.
[03:49:18.320 --> 03:49:19.160]   I was like, oh no.
[03:49:19.160 --> 03:49:20.880]   Okay, I'm going to pitch this over to Lane,
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:21.720]   as I am right now.
[03:49:21.720 --> 03:49:23.200]   So Lane, take it away.
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:24.080]   What's the story?
[03:49:24.080 --> 03:49:26.920]   Does ingesting collagen improve skin appearance?
[03:49:26.920 --> 03:49:28.840]   And does it, do we have any idea
[03:49:28.840 --> 03:49:30.120]   what the mechanism might be?
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:30.940]   - Okay.
[03:49:30.940 --> 03:49:32.440]   - So I have a long question folks,
[03:49:32.440 --> 03:49:33.640]   but I had to set the stage.
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:36.280]   Well, first off, I will never make somebody apologize
[03:49:36.280 --> 03:49:39.040]   for giving a long winded preamble, right?
[03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:40.680]   Because you know how long I'm about to go.
[03:49:40.680 --> 03:49:42.400]   - We're both scientists.
[03:49:42.400 --> 03:49:46.040]   - So I will tell you, I actually,
[03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:48.640]   like after I commented on that post,
[03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:49.980]   I went and looked up some more research
[03:49:49.980 --> 03:49:51.840]   and I've actually changed my mind a little bit.
[03:49:51.840 --> 03:49:53.960]   Okay, which probably wouldn't surprise you.
[03:49:53.960 --> 03:49:55.180]   I haven't completely changed my mind,
[03:49:55.180 --> 03:49:56.680]   but I've shifted a little bit.
[03:49:56.680 --> 03:49:59.200]   So first off, my first thought
[03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:00.920]   was exactly what your thought was.
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:02.560]   This is all getting broken down
[03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:03.720]   to constitutive amino acids.
[03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:04.880]   It's not like you're taking collagen
[03:50:04.880 --> 03:50:06.560]   and just like putting it in the place you want it.
[03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:09.380]   Like just, you know, like that sort of thing.
[03:50:09.380 --> 03:50:15.240]   So my skepticism was also
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:18.260]   because one of the highest quality
[03:50:18.260 --> 03:50:19.900]   protein metabolism labs out there,
[03:50:19.900 --> 03:50:22.320]   where Jordan Tromblin is, is Luke Van Loon.
[03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:23.920]   Luke Van Loon's lab is one of the best
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:28.680]   protein metabolism labs in the world.
[03:50:28.680 --> 03:50:29.720]   And they were publishing research
[03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:31.080]   back when I was in graduate school.
[03:50:31.080 --> 03:50:32.080]   In fact, I think Jordan and I
[03:50:32.080 --> 03:50:34.440]   were actually in graduate school at the same time.
[03:50:34.440 --> 03:50:38.200]   So they did a study where they looked at
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:43.060]   after exercise, giving either whey protein
[03:50:43.060 --> 03:50:44.080]   or collagen protein.
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:45.880]   And they looked at skeletal muscle protein synthesis
[03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:48.280]   and they looked at connective tissue protein synthesis.
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:49.120]   Right?
[03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:52.880]   And they saw no difference between whey protein
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:55.520]   and collagen protein in connective tissue synthesis
[03:50:55.520 --> 03:50:56.740]   after exercise.
[03:50:56.740 --> 03:50:59.640]   And so, but by the way,
[03:50:59.640 --> 03:51:01.720]   collagen did not stimulate muscle protein synthesis,
[03:51:01.720 --> 03:51:03.560]   even at like 25 grams, I think it was.
[03:51:03.560 --> 03:51:05.280]   Which most protein sources,
[03:51:05.280 --> 03:51:07.100]   even like plant protein sources,
[03:51:07.100 --> 03:51:09.800]   will stimulate muscle protein synthesis at like 25 grams.
[03:51:09.800 --> 03:51:10.920]   - So it's very low quality.
[03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:12.580]   - So it's low quality in terms of skeletal muscle.
[03:51:12.580 --> 03:51:14.240]   Anybody who's telling you like,
[03:51:14.240 --> 03:51:16.600]   "Collagen's good for building muscle."
[03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:18.340]   I mean, it's better than no amino acids,
[03:51:18.340 --> 03:51:20.120]   but it's one of the worst you can get
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:22.300]   in terms of all protein sources.
[03:51:22.300 --> 03:51:28.760]   So that study, again, since I know this lab,
[03:51:29.400 --> 03:51:30.940]   I have a lot of trust of the data
[03:51:30.940 --> 03:51:31.920]   that comes out of there.
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:32.760]   Right?
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:35.000]   And it was a well-designed studies, well-executed study.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:38.320]   But then there's these meta-analysis out there,
[03:51:38.320 --> 03:51:41.080]   looking at skin, looking at, you know,
[03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:43.680]   even like some we're trying to make associations
[03:51:43.680 --> 03:51:46.720]   with connective tissue injuries and whatnot.
[03:51:46.720 --> 03:51:50.840]   And again, I'm always a little bit,
[03:51:50.840 --> 03:51:53.480]   have the heebie-jeebies when we jump straight to,
[03:51:53.480 --> 03:51:54.880]   we have an outcome,
[03:51:54.880 --> 03:51:56.440]   but we don't know what the mechanism is.
[03:51:56.440 --> 03:51:57.480]   Right?
[03:51:57.480 --> 03:52:01.000]   And then I started reading a review
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:03.160]   by Luke Van Loon, actually.
[03:52:03.160 --> 03:52:06.080]   And it was talking about like the,
[03:52:06.080 --> 03:52:11.080]   so the collagen is three alpha helixes.
[03:52:11.080 --> 03:52:14.480]   So if you think about DNA, right?
[03:52:14.480 --> 03:52:15.960]   It's a double helix, right?
[03:52:15.960 --> 03:52:17.600]   So think about three helixes.
[03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:19.260]   And an alpha helix just refers
[03:52:19.260 --> 03:52:21.320]   to the way a protein is shaped.
[03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:26.360]   And they are,
[03:52:26.360 --> 03:52:29.040]   they have a very large amount of glycine.
[03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:31.280]   So glycine is an non-essential amino acid.
[03:52:31.280 --> 03:52:35.320]   And every third residue in collagen,
[03:52:35.320 --> 03:52:36.920]   in the three alpha helixes,
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:40.560]   every third residue is a glycine molecule.
[03:52:40.560 --> 03:52:43.860]   So 33% of collagen is glycine.
[03:52:43.860 --> 03:52:49.440]   And then I want to say 10% is proline.
[03:52:49.440 --> 03:52:53.360]   And then another like 10% ish is hydroxyproline.
[03:52:53.360 --> 03:52:56.120]   So proline that's had a hydroxyl molecule added to it.
[03:52:56.120 --> 03:52:58.840]   And that's done, apparently the hydro,
[03:52:58.840 --> 03:53:01.240]   nobody needs to know this, but just for fun stuff,
[03:53:01.240 --> 03:53:04.640]   the hydroxyproline helps stabilize the structure
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:07.200]   because of the hydrogen bonding with hydroxyl molecules,
[03:53:07.200 --> 03:53:08.560]   which I found interesting.
[03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:13.440]   So you have these three amino acids
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:14.600]   and amino acid derivatives
[03:53:14.600 --> 03:53:17.120]   that make up over half the amino acids
[03:53:17.120 --> 03:53:20.440]   in the collagen protein.
[03:53:20.440 --> 03:53:23.280]   And, well, my next thing was,
[03:53:23.280 --> 03:53:25.600]   well, a lot of non-essential amino acids,
[03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:26.720]   if you give them in the diet,
[03:53:26.720 --> 03:53:28.800]   they don't really raise non-essential amino acids
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:30.800]   in the plasma because the gut, liver,
[03:53:30.800 --> 03:53:32.660]   extract a bunch of them.
[03:53:32.660 --> 03:53:33.680]   Glycine is different.
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:34.520]   If you give,
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:36.480]   there was a study looking at giving just one gram
[03:53:36.480 --> 03:53:40.960]   of pure glycine and looking at the rise in plasma glycine.
[03:53:40.960 --> 03:53:42.360]   And I think it went up,
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:47.020]   like I think the like native level of glycine in the plasma,
[03:53:47.020 --> 03:53:49.600]   something like 250 micromolar.
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:52.120]   And after giving a gram of it,
[03:53:52.120 --> 03:53:54.000]   it went up to like 400 micromolar.
[03:53:54.000 --> 03:53:57.240]   I'm giving my best estimate based on the graph I saw.
[03:53:57.240 --> 03:54:00.080]   And so then I got thinking,
[03:54:00.080 --> 03:54:03.760]   okay, that's, I guess,
[03:54:03.760 --> 03:54:07.440]   possible if you have more glycine and proline.
[03:54:07.440 --> 03:54:09.840]   I didn't look, I didn't see the proline data,
[03:54:09.840 --> 03:54:12.000]   but if you have more glycine and proline
[03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:13.840]   that's winding up in the plasma,
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:18.120]   not that they're being directed to those tissues,
[03:54:18.120 --> 03:54:22.620]   but since those tissues use so much of that amino acid,
[03:54:22.620 --> 03:54:24.480]   perhaps it does help.
[03:54:24.480 --> 03:54:28.940]   And then if you look at like whey protein versus collagen
[03:54:28.940 --> 03:54:32.160]   and the content of glycine and proline,
[03:54:32.160 --> 03:54:36.960]   I think collagen has like three to 10 times
[03:54:36.960 --> 03:54:38.700]   the amount of glycine and proline in it
[03:54:38.700 --> 03:54:40.720]   compared to whey protein.
[03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:45.620]   So am I ready to say collagen helps skin
[03:54:45.620 --> 03:54:47.200]   and connective tissue and whatnot?
[03:54:47.200 --> 03:54:48.760]   I'm not, 'cause I'm still, you know,
[03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:51.440]   this study looking at connective tissue synthesis
[03:54:51.440 --> 03:54:52.280]   doesn't show anything.
[03:54:52.280 --> 03:54:53.840]   So the mechanism is incomplete,
[03:54:53.840 --> 03:54:58.920]   but there is a plausible,
[03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:03.960]   at least they've shown that glycine can go up in the plasma
[03:55:03.960 --> 03:55:05.320]   from taking it in.
[03:55:05.320 --> 03:55:09.000]   And it is a big component of collagen.
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:10.760]   - So why aren't we just suggesting
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:13.640]   that people take glycine instead of collagen?
[03:55:13.640 --> 03:55:15.640]   - Well, I think what they would say is like,
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:18.360]   there's, because you're getting hydroxyproline
[03:55:18.360 --> 03:55:20.560]   in the collagen that you're taking,
[03:55:20.560 --> 03:55:22.760]   that probably, I don't know how much hydroxyproline
[03:55:22.760 --> 03:55:24.520]   is typically in the diet, you know?
[03:55:24.520 --> 03:55:30.120]   But I would say, again, I am a little bit nervous
[03:55:30.120 --> 03:55:32.240]   about like a lot of these subjective measurements
[03:55:32.240 --> 03:55:34.360]   of skin appearance and skin tightness.
[03:55:34.360 --> 03:55:37.260]   I mean, I'm not saying faking data.
[03:55:37.260 --> 03:55:40.680]   I'm just saying that data is easy to get wrong
[03:55:40.680 --> 03:55:42.320]   because it is subjective, right?
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:45.640]   It's less, the more subjective things are,
[03:55:45.640 --> 03:55:47.720]   the more bias you introduce.
[03:55:47.720 --> 03:55:51.280]   So I hold open the idea that supplemental collagen
[03:55:51.280 --> 03:55:55.560]   could help with skin, hair, nails.
[03:55:55.560 --> 03:55:56.920]   I'm not convinced by the data,
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:55:57.840]   and I'm not going to tell people
[03:55:57.840 --> 03:55:59.560]   to spend their money on it just yet,
[03:55:59.560 --> 03:56:02.920]   but I'm going to stop short of saying that I think it's BS.
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:06.440]   And I've actually changed my tune slightly on that
[03:56:06.440 --> 03:56:09.120]   from looking in this data a little bit further.
[03:56:09.120 --> 03:56:10.960]   - Thank you for that very thorough answer
[03:56:10.960 --> 03:56:12.240]   and very clear answer.
[03:56:12.240 --> 03:56:16.880]   If nothing else, it tells us that collagen protein
[03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:21.880]   is going to be least ideal for post-workout protein
[03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:24.400]   because of the fact that it's, you know,
[03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:28.080]   it lacks significant amounts of leucine, et cetera.
[03:56:28.080 --> 03:56:31.440]   So it might be good for skin.
[03:56:31.440 --> 03:56:34.840]   Definitely not a great protein for dietary protein reasons.
[03:56:34.840 --> 03:56:37.480]   - No, it's very, very low in the branch amino acids,
[03:56:37.480 --> 03:56:40.120]   like the lowest in leucine of any protein source
[03:56:40.120 --> 03:56:40.960]   I'm aware of.
[03:56:40.960 --> 03:56:44.280]   I think it's like 2% leucine, which is like most,
[03:56:44.280 --> 03:56:48.640]   even like the worst plant-based sources of leucine
[03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:50.400]   are like 6.5% leucine.
[03:56:50.400 --> 03:56:53.400]   So like the worst sources of protein in the diet
[03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:54.920]   are still like three times more leucine
[03:56:54.920 --> 03:56:56.640]   than you get in collagen protein, so.
[03:56:56.640 --> 03:56:57.800]   - And a quality whey protein
[03:56:57.800 --> 03:56:58.640]   would be the highest leucine available.
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:01.520]   - Oh, it'd be 11, 12, 13%, yeah.
[03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:03.160]   - Eggs, whey protein.
[03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:06.160]   - Eggs are going to be around 9% leucine.
[03:57:06.160 --> 03:57:07.240]   You know, beef, chicken,
[03:57:07.240 --> 03:57:09.960]   most your animal sources are around 8%,
[03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:13.100]   and then most of your plant sources are 8% and under.
[03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:17.060]   - Great, well, Dr. Lane Norton,
[03:57:17.060 --> 03:57:20.040]   thank you for coming back here
[03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:21.720]   for the second time on the podcast.
[03:57:21.720 --> 03:57:25.760]   I must say it's a true pleasure to sit down with you
[03:57:25.760 --> 03:57:29.880]   and discuss training, nutrition, supplementation,
[03:57:29.880 --> 03:57:33.540]   recovery, pain management, stress, life advice,
[03:57:33.540 --> 03:57:37.640]   and for so many reasons.
[03:57:37.640 --> 03:57:41.920]   A, you're, you know, a serious scientist, you know,
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:46.100]   in our business of science, that really means something.
[03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:47.620]   You're serious about the science
[03:57:47.620 --> 03:57:50.680]   and you're a lighthearted guy in the right context,
[03:57:50.680 --> 03:57:52.240]   but you're a serious scientist.
[03:57:52.240 --> 03:57:56.020]   You believe in the process and you provide the nuance,
[03:57:56.020 --> 03:57:58.540]   even though that might not be convenient
[03:57:58.540 --> 03:58:02.140]   to what somebody wants or convenient to the discussion.
[03:58:02.140 --> 03:58:04.420]   - By the way, not convenient for me either.
[03:58:04.420 --> 03:58:06.300]   I'd rather this stuff be so simple, you know?
[03:58:06.300 --> 03:58:09.260]   - Right, sure, sure, you're like the rest of us.
[03:58:09.260 --> 03:58:12.020]   And at the same time, I really appreciate it
[03:58:12.020 --> 03:58:14.840]   because we are now also colleagues
[03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:19.080]   in the public health, public facing landscape,
[03:58:19.080 --> 03:58:20.420]   social media it's sometimes called,
[03:58:20.420 --> 03:58:23.880]   but a lot of landscapes, podcasts, YouTube, et cetera.
[03:58:23.880 --> 03:58:28.880]   And it's required, it's needed that people like you exist.
[03:58:28.880 --> 03:58:31.920]   And I will go so far to say that, you know,
[03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:33.200]   and I'm not alone in this, right?
[03:58:33.200 --> 03:58:35.640]   Because I've talked about this with Rogan
[03:58:35.640 --> 03:58:38.980]   and with Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, excuse me,
[03:58:38.980 --> 03:58:42.900]   and others, you know, in an ocean of noise,
[03:58:42.900 --> 03:58:47.120]   some of which has validity, right?
[03:58:47.120 --> 03:58:50.160]   But in an ocean of noise about nutrition and training
[03:58:50.160 --> 03:58:52.720]   and all these different things and how to,
[03:58:52.720 --> 03:58:55.680]   evidence-based blank and science-based that,
[03:58:55.680 --> 03:59:00.080]   you really clearly are pure signal.
[03:59:00.080 --> 03:59:02.080]   Like you're going to take as much time
[03:59:02.080 --> 03:59:05.020]   and as much effort to communicate the real signal.
[03:59:05.020 --> 03:59:07.360]   And you today have really defined for us,
[03:59:07.360 --> 03:59:12.180]   for you what is real versus not real versus a maybe.
[03:59:12.180 --> 03:59:14.580]   And I just want people to hear that loud and clear
[03:59:14.580 --> 03:59:17.820]   because I think sometimes people pay attention
[03:59:17.820 --> 03:59:20.500]   to how spirited you are and they miss the fact
[03:59:20.500 --> 03:59:24.900]   that in that spirited nature and in the nuance
[03:59:24.900 --> 03:59:27.860]   and in the, look, we're both long-winded at times.
[03:59:27.860 --> 03:59:30.420]   Like I know, because I know this for myself,
[03:59:30.420 --> 03:59:31.940]   but I certainly know it for you that,
[03:59:31.940 --> 03:59:35.220]   that comes from a place of respect for the science
[03:59:35.220 --> 03:59:37.240]   and respect for your audience.
[03:59:37.240 --> 03:59:38.880]   That is not being dismissive.
[03:59:38.880 --> 03:59:40.200]   That's actually respect for them.
[03:59:40.200 --> 03:59:42.300]   It would be disrespectful to just give them
[03:59:42.300 --> 03:59:44.020]   the answer they want or give them a quick answer
[03:59:44.020 --> 03:59:45.660]   without the explanation.
[03:59:45.660 --> 03:59:48.940]   So I just really want to extend like a real voice
[03:59:48.940 --> 03:59:51.700]   of gratitude for you, for what you did for us today,
[03:59:51.700 --> 03:59:53.740]   just far too much to list off.
[03:59:53.740 --> 03:59:56.540]   It's all so valuable, just so, so valuable.
[03:59:56.540 --> 03:59:59.660]   And also what you do on social media and the way you do it.
[03:59:59.660 --> 04:00:01.620]   And look, I also really love and respect
[04:00:01.620 --> 04:00:04.060]   your fighting spirit because you're fighting,
[04:00:04.060 --> 04:00:06.340]   you're fighting for truth, you're fighting for good.
[04:00:06.340 --> 04:00:08.900]   And I also love the posts and the pictures of your kids.
[04:00:08.900 --> 04:00:09.900]   They're delightful.
[04:00:09.900 --> 04:00:11.500]   And it's great to see that the balance
[04:00:11.500 --> 04:00:12.580]   in your life you've created.
[04:00:12.580 --> 04:00:15.060]   So I could go on and on, but I'm going to cut this short
[04:00:15.060 --> 04:00:18.540]   by just saying a giant thank you for being the signal
[04:00:18.540 --> 04:00:21.140]   among all the noise.
[04:00:21.140 --> 04:00:23.820]   - Well, speak for yourself of being long-winded
[04:00:23.820 --> 04:00:27.800]   'cause I'm not, but honestly, I appreciate that.
[04:00:27.800 --> 04:00:29.640]   That means a lot to me.
[04:00:29.640 --> 04:00:34.400]   You know, I recognize how valuable your platform is
[04:00:34.400 --> 04:00:35.800]   and how many people want to be on it.
[04:00:35.800 --> 04:00:38.660]   And the fact that I've been asked to come on again,
[04:00:38.660 --> 04:00:39.900]   I really appreciate it.
[04:00:39.900 --> 04:00:41.940]   And to be able to have the opportunity
[04:00:41.940 --> 04:00:44.140]   to disseminate this information
[04:00:44.140 --> 04:00:45.900]   and not just talk about the studies,
[04:00:45.900 --> 04:00:49.020]   but talk about, hey, here's a method of thinking.
[04:00:49.020 --> 04:00:51.660]   Here's a way to approach this stuff.
[04:00:51.660 --> 04:00:54.060]   And I mean, you kind of pointed out like,
[04:00:54.060 --> 04:00:56.620]   I would love to be able to say, yeah, seed oils are bad.
[04:00:56.620 --> 04:00:59.780]   Like, I'd love to give you that answer, but I can't do it.
[04:00:59.780 --> 04:01:03.800]   I can't make myself do it because I look at the evidence.
[04:01:03.800 --> 04:01:06.260]   And I'm glad you said spirited.
[04:01:06.260 --> 04:01:08.760]   I do feel like I do have some fighting spirit,
[04:01:08.760 --> 04:01:13.760]   but at the end of the day, I tell people,
[04:01:13.760 --> 04:01:15.740]   you know, I'm human.
[04:01:15.740 --> 04:01:18.780]   I've got my own biases, my own beliefs,
[04:01:18.780 --> 04:01:20.420]   and I like making money like anybody.
[04:01:20.420 --> 04:01:23.500]   But I, and I like to be right.
[04:01:23.500 --> 04:01:27.000]   But at the end of the day, I want to help.
[04:01:27.000 --> 04:01:32.000]   And I believe that if I continue to execute on that mission,
[04:01:33.060 --> 04:01:35.400]   that, you know, financial stuff will take care of itself.
[04:01:35.400 --> 04:01:36.320]   And at the end of the day,
[04:01:36.320 --> 04:01:41.060]   I just want to be a net positive on the world.
[04:01:41.060 --> 04:01:42.900]   So thank you for giving me that chance.
[04:01:42.900 --> 04:01:45.120]   - It's been a true pleasure,
[04:01:45.120 --> 04:01:49.240]   and you're absolutely more than net positive on the world.
[04:01:49.240 --> 04:01:51.080]   And we'll just have to have you come back
[04:01:51.080 --> 04:01:53.300]   and talk to us again before long.
[04:01:53.300 --> 04:01:55.040]   Thank you so much.
[04:01:55.040 --> 04:01:56.400]   - Anytime, thank you.
[04:01:56.400 --> 04:01:57.240]   - Thank you for joining me

[04:02:34.240 --> 04:02:36.120]   I do read all the comments.
[04:02:36.120 --> 04:02:37.280]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[04:02:37.280 --> 04:02:38.460]   I have a new book coming out.
[04:02:38.460 --> 04:02:40.080]   It's my very first book.
[04:02:40.080 --> 04:02:41.480]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[04:02:41.480 --> 04:02:43.640]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[04:02:43.640 --> 04:02:44.800]   This is a book that I've been working on
[04:02:44.800 --> 04:02:45.960]   for more than five years,
[04:02:45.960 --> 04:02:48.280]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[04:02:48.280 --> 04:02:49.840]   of research and experience.
[04:02:49.840 --> 04:02:52.900]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[04:02:52.900 --> 04:02:55.400]   to exercise, to stress control,
[04:02:55.400 --> 04:02:57.880]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[04:02:57.880 --> 04:03:01.200]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[04:03:01.200 --> 04:03:03.280]   for the protocols that are included.
[04:03:03.280 --> 04:03:07.160]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[04:03:07.160 --> 04:03:09.560]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[04:03:09.560 --> 04:03:11.320]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[04:03:11.320 --> 04:03:13.080]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[04:03:13.080 --> 04:03:15.720]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[04:03:15.720 --> 04:03:18.040]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[04:03:18.040 --> 04:03:20.960]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[04:03:20.960 --> 04:03:23.820]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now known as X,
[04:03:23.820 --> 04:03:25.780]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[04:03:25.780 --> 04:03:27.260]   And on all those platforms,
[04:03:27.260 --> 04:03:29.580]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[04:03:29.580 --> 04:03:31.100]   some of which overlap with the contents
[04:03:31.100 --> 04:03:32.340]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[04:03:32.340 --> 04:03:34.400]   but much of which is distinct from the contents
[04:03:34.400 --> 04:03:36.020]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[04:03:36.020 --> 04:03:39.760]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[04:03:39.760 --> 04:03:40.980]   If you haven't already subscribed
[04:03:40.980 --> 04:03:42.620]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[04:03:42.620 --> 04:03:44.060]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[04:03:44.060 --> 04:03:46.160]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[04:03:46.160 --> 04:03:47.740]   that includes what we call protocols,
[04:03:47.740 --> 04:03:50.180]   which are brief one to three page PDFs
[04:03:50.180 --> 04:03:53.220]   that cover things such as neuroplasticity and learning,
[04:03:53.220 --> 04:03:56.300]   dopamine optimization, how to get better sleep,
[04:03:56.300 --> 04:03:57.980]   things like deliberate cold exposure.
[04:03:57.980 --> 04:04:00.120]   We have a foundational fitness protocol.
[04:04:00.120 --> 04:04:04.020]   We have a protocol all about habit forming and much more.
[04:04:04.020 --> 04:04:06.500]   To sign up, again, at completely zero cost,
[04:04:06.500 --> 04:04:08.660]   you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[04:04:08.660 --> 04:04:10.680]   go to the menu function in the corner,
[04:04:10.680 --> 04:04:13.380]   scroll down to newsletter, and you provide your email.
[04:04:13.380 --> 04:04:15.020]   I should point out that we do not share
[04:04:15.020 --> 04:04:16.740]   your email with anybody.
[04:04:16.740 --> 04:04:18.840]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[04:04:18.840 --> 04:04:20.260]   with Dr. Lane Norton.
[04:04:20.260 --> 04:04:22.520]   And last, but certainly not least,
[04:04:22.520 --> 04:04:24.680]   thank you for your interest in science.
[04:04:24.680 --> 04:04:27.260]   (upbeat music)
[04:04:27.260 --> 04:04:29.840]   (upbeat music)
