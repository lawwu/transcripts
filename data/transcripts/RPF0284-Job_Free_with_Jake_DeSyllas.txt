[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Today in radical personal finance we talk with Jake the Silas and we talked about his brand new book called job free four ways
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.240]   To quit the rat race and achieve financial freedom on your terms
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.920]   If you're interested in achieving financial independence and financial freedom, this is a must listen to interview and a must-read book
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.280]   Because you need to know your options before you begin
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.960]   This is a great place to start
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   You
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:44.280]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets and I'm your host. Thank you for being with me today today
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.100]   We got a good one for you. We love to talk about financial independence on the radical personal finance podcast
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.120]   Love to talk about all the different ways that you can accomplish this goal
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.240]   But I always in the past with kind of missing the framework. I didn't quite have the framework
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   Well, Jake the Silas gives us the framework and we've got to choose your own adventure so you can decide what's right for you. I
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.920]   First saw Jake give these four options in a presentation a long time ago
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.600]   But I and I asked him to come on and do an interview but he wanted to wait because he was writing a book
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.160]   On the subject. Well that book is out now. I'm thrilled to bring the interview in the discussion to you
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.700]   You're gonna enjoy the content today because we're not just talking about the book. We're talking about the subject
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.200]   so in many ways today's show will serve as a little mini course a mini course on the
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.040]   different options that you have
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.000]   so many people get fixated on
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.280]   their one way that they know of to create financial independence and they forget about the other options and I think Jake's done a great
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.920]   Job of bringing together all your different options so that you can figure out which path is going to fit you
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360]   Most of us are pursuing this goal of financial independence and financial freedom
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.480]   I am but we're probably pursuing it in different ways and it'll be valuable

[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.040]   Jake welcome back to radical personal finance. Hi Joshua. It's a pleasure to be here
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.440]   So first question is I see we're talking on Skype. I see from
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.380]   Your Skype location that you are in I guess Panama City Panama right now. Is that right?
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.920]   Yeah, that's right in sunny Panama and loving it here
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.340]   so quick personal update as I understand it you and you and your girlfriend you guys have
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.920]   Sold everything you digitized everything you hit the road and you're doing the full-time vagabond thing. Is that right?
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.760]   yep, that's it the last it's been a
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.280]   Progressive project over the last couple of years, you know
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.200]   We we started spending six months abroad each winter to get away from the cold of England
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.480]   And we were coming back to England and we just decided, you know
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.000]   let's just go for it and and sell the flat get rid of all of our stuff and
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.800]   And slow travel the world. And so that's what we've chosen to do. It's been a really liberating process. It's been
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.400]   I've learned a huge amount through getting rid of all my stuff and
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:53.080]   becoming minimalist and and choosing this lifestyle and the first place that we've chosen is Panama and we actually got here and like it so
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.320]   Much that we're gonna stick around here for a while and and check it out, you know more because there's just so much going on
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.960]   Here, it's really dynamic. It's an amazing city and it's a very much a
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.360]   Place with a lot of innovation and entrepreneurship and growth. And so yeah, that's where we're calling home for the moment
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.320]   So I was picturing that you'd gone on a multiple country tour, but you flew from England to Panama and and there you stay
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.440]   Well, yeah, because our plan has always been not really to go, you know from hotel to hotel
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.840]   But rather to actually live in different countries for at least six months and then you know
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.320]   See how we feel and move on from there
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.400]   And so we're doing slow travel because that way, you know
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.880]   You really get to feel what it's like to live somewhere you get to meet people locally and and actually experience life in a place
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.280]   Otherwise it can become a bit of a blur and that was our experience when we were staying in Mexico
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.120]   We were staying in places for at least a couple of months sometimes longer and one, you know
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.520]   One of one year we went from place to place every couple of months in another year
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   We just stayed in one place for six months
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.800]   So that's the way that we like to do it because it gives us more of an insight
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.920]   Into you know, what life is like in different places
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.800]   And so the first place is gonna be Panama and you know
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.480]   We're just gonna play it by ear and see how it goes
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.760]   I read when I read travel logs seems like people who go out on traveling the first six months or a year
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.400]   They just go go go go go go go and then if they're still on the road
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.680]   They start to slow down and say why did we go so fast?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.000]   So maybe it's just the personality a thing at the moment
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   I'm like, how would you stay in one city when there's so many places to go but here past that initial
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.200]   Frantic phase and you're into the to the to the regular phase. It sounds like yeah
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.280]   The first time we did a couple of long long term travel trips
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.480]   We we were doing more of the frantic phase
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.920]   we went all the way down through Latin America through Argentina and then back up through Chile and
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.120]   It was great. It was really good fun
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.400]   But it's more of a holiday than than living and you know
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.240]   We we both have lots of things that we want to be getting on with as well
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.960]   My wife runs a personal development website and I'm writing and doing my podcast and stuff
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.180]   So, you know, that's the the plan is to actually experience life on the ground and we've already met some really nice people here in Panama
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.200]   So it's definitely working out the way we like it final question practically speaking
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.280]   So if you're staying that much time like what is selling all your stuff mean?
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.920]   I mean how many suitcases do you have?
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.200]   Do you have things that you're shipping from each house or are you?
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.520]   Really still in we only have a couple of suitcases worth of stuff phase
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.080]   No, we've we're down to
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.200]   two bags each so one hold luggage bag and one cabin bag and
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.240]   everything I own fits in in those two bags and
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.160]   so, you know that we just got rid of everything and it was it was
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.720]   Incredibly liberating because I realized traveling that most of the stuff we were putting in storage. I didn't even think about I didn't miss and
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.100]   You know war obviously renting furnished places
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:57.360]   and you can rent great apartments with all the furniture that you need and everything and we're staying in a place that has a pool and
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.800]   Everything we could need for a nice comfortable life here. But you know all of my
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.320]   Photographs and my data and my projects they all live in the cloud now
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.720]   anyway
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.000]   or in encrypted drives in the cloud or on you know and places that I can access from the internet and
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So really we just have some clothes and and our laptops
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.960]   That's it. It's great
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   I've listened to some of your shows on the practical
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.720]   things you learned of downsizing and we've made a lot of progress in our family we sold our big house got rid of a lot
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.200]   of stuff there and
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.640]   I've got a giant bin full of photos and I keep thinking
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   Okay, am I gonna follow through and get these things digitized?
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.160]   I got a giant pen of old CDs and I gotta go through and digitize and get rid of all that stuff
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.720]   And my CDs aren't even the music which is easy if they were just music. I just dump them
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.160]   They're all personal development stuff, which a little harder to stream on on on Pandora
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.080]   But but it's inspiring and who knows maybe we'll join you someday
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.080]   So I want to talk about this book that you have recently published. I'm very excited for it
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   I remember you gave a speech on this topic and I had reached out to you
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.040]   I guess I was probably a year ago now and I said listen
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.160]   I want to interview you specifically on the topic and you said wait for the book
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.920]   So the book is here and so we can do it. So what's the name of your book and what's it about?
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.880]   So the book is called job free and it's about four ways to quit the rat race
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.640]   achieve financial freedom on your own terms and
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.600]   So what I'm doing is really describing
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.160]   different approaches to getting out of unfulfilling jobs and finding a way to live free of jobs and
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:38.400]   That's the this sort of aim of the book is to to really provide an overview of the different approaches that you can take
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.720]   both based on my own experience having gone through entrepreneurship and building and selling a business and
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.760]   Also based on all the people that I've interviewed who found different ways to live job free
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.760]   I love the topic and I wish I'd written the book. I'm just gonna steal it from now on
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   It's it's on my required reading list
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.280]   I think your brain and my brain works similarly in some ways where we'd like to categorize things and it's not
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.660]   What annoys me about the finance world as people always say this is the way you have to do it and I look and say
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.720]   Well, that's one way and that can work well for this type of person in these circumstances
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.880]   But here's another way who can which can work better and I think that's what you've effectively
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.540]   Done with this book is you've outlined
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:25.080]   Here are the four different ways to quit the rat race and achieve financial freedom on your term on your terms and you can choose
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.160]   Which of these is appropriate for you here are advantages and disadvantages
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.920]   so the book is a perfect introductory text for anyone who is interested in
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.720]   Just develop anyone who's interested in in
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.560]   Figuring out the different approaches and then figuring out what's right for them
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.640]   So what are the four ways to actually accomplish this goal of quitting the rat race?
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.680]   Right. So the four ways that I've found
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.280]   I mean every everyone's journey is different and I've interviewed a lot of people on my podcast and read different people's stories and
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.400]   some people combine different
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   approaches, but I think it's helpful to think of four fundamental approaches that you can kind of take bits from and
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.760]   So the different approaches that I've found are I call them extreme saving
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.840]   Which is very much in the tradition of the sort of Joe Dominguez your money or your life
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.720]   You know
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.920]   You have a job and you save and save more than 50% ideally 75%
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.760]   So you can get to the point of financial independence and then you live job free because you can just quit your job and live
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.040]   From your investments. So that's one approach, but there are other approaches, too
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.520]   I mean there's an approach called unjobbing which is an approach which is to say well
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.880]   I don't want to work for somebody else. I don't want a job that's unfulfilling
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.760]   I want to do work that is meaningful to me and I find it fulfilling every day that brings me joy and
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:56.920]   Happiness and sometimes that kind of work doesn't pay as much as a you know, a job that is less fulfilling
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:03.680]   So people who take the unjobbing route are often freelancers or they have multiple side hustles and different projects
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.240]   But they choose often to live very frugally in order to do work. So it really brings them
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.560]   Joy, and that way it's not like a job
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.600]   So that's the second one
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.480]   The third one is really the idea of having a lifestyle business and this is where you choose to develop a business
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.920]   That's going to give you income
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.360]   So that you have the freedom to live as you choose and a lot of the people who choose
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.520]   location independent lifestyles and have online businesses that give them an income and allow them to
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.160]   You know not have to go to work every day not have to commute and do all those things
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.880]   but just live from that kind of income choose this approach and
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.880]   property would be another typical example of a lifestyle business and
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.960]   lastly is
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:54.040]   The idea of having a startup and this was my route and that's where rather than build a business that is going to just give
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.280]   you income often as a solopreneur often which is what a lot of the lifestyle entrepreneurs are a
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.760]   Startup is where you're really focusing on building the value in a business. You're building an enterprise
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:12.160]   That's going to grow it's going to have a massive impact and ultimately it's going to have value as a business so that you can
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.720]   Potentially one day sell your business and then use that
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   Financial independence to give you the freedom to do whatever you want with your time. And so those are the four different routes
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.200]   It's basically
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.760]   extreme saving
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.360]   Lifestyle businesses and startups. I want to hang some examples on these so people can understand
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.400]   I'll do the first one you do the next three of try to just mention some examples of popular media personalities
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:43.060]   The first one is the dominant theme in this kind of personal finance early retirement financial independence space the extreme savings
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.280]   so you mentioned Joe Dominguez Vicky Robbins with
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.680]   Just blanked on the book
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.800]   Well money or your money or your life
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.920]   Also popularized mr. Money mustache the leading figure in the online space Jacob
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.120]   Yeah
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:04.160]   Lund Fisker early retirement extreme also guests that we've had on the show many many guests from this situation ranging from Joe
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.760]   Rebel spy from the money mustache forum. We just had him on
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:15.160]   many many of my guests have been in this extreme savings perspective where everything is based upon the
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.520]   Based upon the savings rate. I feel like this one is currently a little bit over representative
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.680]   Give some examples of popular or somewhat known
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.640]   personalities that fit the other three the other three categories
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.200]   Sure. Well, I mean, let's take for example
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.480]   Lifestyle businesses. I mean, I think this is really where you see
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.980]   things like Tim Ferriss is for our work week was a book that was
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.120]   highly influential in getting people to think about this type of approach and a lot of
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:53.640]   People used that book even though Tim himself did various things including selling a business. He really popularized this idea of
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.680]   focusing on having a business that's going to give you income so you can live as you want and
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.560]   The the approach has been taken by a lot of the people who pursue
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.160]   Lots sort of travel based entrepreneurship
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.840]   There's a book called
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.640]   Building a freedom business and all the authors name actually slips my mind for a moment
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:22.000]   But there's different different people have taken that approach. So that's lifestyle businesses. Then if you think about startups
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.600]   My experience was through building a startup
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.360]   But a person who's written a really nice book about that approach is Derek Sivers
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.920]   And he built the business CD baby and eventually sold it for 20 million and he now lives
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.960]   From you know the income that he made from from selling that business and does various other projects, right?
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.040]   And and and so that's some examples there, but there's also this thing called unjobbing and there's lots of people living
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.920]   Sort of unjobbing style lifestyles the person I think is really most
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:59.080]   Representative of this is a guy called Michael Fogler who actually wrote a book called unjobbing and he writes about his own experience
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.360]   He was trained as a classical guitarist
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.760]   and he tried for many years to get a job as a teaching position as a classical guitarist and
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.560]   He found after many years that he hadn't been able to get a full-time appointment doing that
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.480]   But he'd made money just doing lots of other things
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:20.880]   You know various side hustles and part-time work and this and that and eventually he realized he just didn't want a full-time job
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.960]   And so he pursued that lifestyle living as frugally as he could
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.000]   So that so that he could then pursue things that were meaningful to him and he did various things
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.160]   He was a peace activist and then he did some writing various other things that brought him fulfillment
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.040]   The startup idea I think is the most historically popular
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.000]   This was the this was the way that when I was young and I was talking with my brothers about how we were gonna get
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.720]   Rich it was okay. We're gonna build a big business and then
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.560]   As you said Ferris pop I think did more to popularize the idea of the lifestyle business just build a business that's big enough
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.840]   But it's fuzz on flexible terms anyone else that's well developed
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.160]   Then extreme savings has been somewhat developed especially over the last few years with with the rise of personal finance blocks
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.840]   but this unjobbing one, this is still I think the
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:17.040]   Not the black hole, but this is the one that I don't I don't really connect with very very much
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.720]   I guess the closest I get is sometimes when I read books on how to sail full-time and they talk about well pull into port
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.960]   And do this little do this little deal here and do this little deal there
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.960]   Are people talking about this as an attractive option?
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.040]   well, I think it really depends on on what is important to you and
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.480]   You know for me and I think for a lot of your listeners to financial independence
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.320]   Is something that I thought was a really important goal to have?
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.000]   To know that I could have the financial independence to do whatever I wanted with my time
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.360]   The downside from unjobbing is that you don't have that financial independence. So you're gonna have to continue
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.480]   You know making a living somehow
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.120]   Through the process of unjobbing but there are lifestyles like that that you describe that some people
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:10.800]   Want to travel and they choose to go and work on cruise ships or whatever because that gives them the lifestyle that they want
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.520]   to do other things like travel and and and that they find fulfilling or
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:21.440]   People who work, you know as in musician as musicians or in jobs that you know
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.060]   You may not actually be earning as much as you could in other ways
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.840]   But if you find it fulfilling then that's fine
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.080]   the other way to think about it, I think is really just if you I think you can be a very successful and job
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.240]   But if you have highly valued skills and you're able to freelance, you know
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.920]   If you have good connections with an industry
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.160]   So a friend of mine worked for many years as a management consultant and he loved the work
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.600]   He found it very fulfilling but it's one of the industries where it is
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:55.560]   Totally full-on you work very long hours you work very intensively and you do earn fairly good money as an employee
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.600]   But what he found was that when he had enough industry contacts, he was able to get to the point where he could do
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:09.080]   freelance work on his own as a freelance consultant on one or two projects a month just
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.800]   Working for equivalent of a couple of days a week and it was work that he enjoyed
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:20.560]   But he didn't need to do all of the stress and hassle of being within a firm and having the constant pressure that goes with
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.320]   the employee status
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.920]   Tell us the Elliot Hulse story. What was his path?
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:34.360]   So Elliot Hulse is another person who I think represents a similar approach to the unjobbing approach. He's very much
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.520]   someone who who's interested in ways of
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.360]   Finding out how you can work on things that are fulfilling to you and he's basically a YouTube personality
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.240]   He has a couple of YouTube channels. He's a strength trainer and his approach is is very much about
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.800]   He runs a business
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.880]   And a gym and teaches people to become the strongest versions of themselves as he puts it
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.280]   And basically what it is is a whole kind of philosophy of life built around his strength training, which is not just
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.800]   In terms of exercise, but also in terms of what it means to be the strongest version of yourself
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.840]   And the reason I think he's interesting from the unjobbing perspective is that he's talked a lot
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:21.280]   About how important it is to him to not be constrained by some unfulfilling job and to find a way to make it work
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.560]   In doing what is fulfilling to him and that's actually what he's done
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:30.920]   He's actually very successful in his business and he he's also got a page called the non-job
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.920]   Manifesto, which he talks about this idea of finding a way to work outside the job paradigm
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.320]   So whereas Michael Fogler who wrote the book?
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:45.120]   Unjobbing is an example of someone who lives very very frugally because that allows him to do the things that he wants to
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.640]   Elliot Hulse is an example of someone who's built a business around what he's truly passionate about
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.520]   And so it's not really work to him because he really enjoys doing it, but it's also a very successful business
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.560]   I'm not extensively familiar with Elliot Hulse's work
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:03.760]   but I do know that I saw a presentation from him at one point that that dramatically affected me and
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.800]   He was talking about simply
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:14.360]   Not accepting any other alternative and just being willing to do whatever it takes and to utilize the resources that many people ignore
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.440]   And his point and I think this may have been reality in his story
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.480]   Correct me after I share the story, please
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.160]   but his point was that in today's world if you got to go down and live in the homeless shelter and
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   get food stamps to get your groceries and get handouts in the homeless shelter and then go and
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:41.200]   Build your business using the free computer at the local library and get a you know, so that you can you know in his case
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.320]   you you
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.840]   You live in the you live like a homeless person or wherever you can get so that you can have the two hundred dollars
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.640]   You need to go buy a camera and again edit the videos of the local library and publish them online
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.360]   That just be determined and don't settle for nothing
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:03.560]   Don't don't settle for it and in hearing somebody present that it made me think to myself and it was a real encouragement to me
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.520]   To realize that that was simply a mental shift that I was willing if I were willing to do that
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.600]   I could make the mental shift that I'm gonna make this work
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.060]   Even if it means I wind up totally broke even if it means I wind up living on food stamps
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.060]   Even if it means I wind up
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.500]   You know again using the library
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.560]   Why not use those resources and get rid of my excuses and it was scary
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.820]   Because I realized that the major things that were holding me back are just were excuses
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.360]   But it was also really inspiring because I just realized yes in today's modern world
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.720]   use the
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.080]   use the the the social safety net that our
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.720]   Societies have evidently decided is important use that to get what you want out of life
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.080]   Yeah, and I think there are some similarities between
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.040]   some of this kind of philosophical ideas behind the extreme saving movement and
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.680]   undropping and what a lot of people who are interested in undropping talk about is how the
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:09.400]   Consumer culture that we're in can really prevent you from doing what you want with your life
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:17.100]   if you just take as a default assumption that you need to have a nice house with a big mortgage and you know,
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.480]   all of the
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.200]   Consumer goods that make you feel like you fit in to these surroundings
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.880]   you know both the extreme savers and the unjobbers have really emphasized that
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.020]   These things come at an enormous cost to your freedom if you want to save for financial independence
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.300]   And if that's what's really meaningful for you
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.160]   Then you can take a look at what you're spending your money on and realize a lot of that stuff is not
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.100]   Getting you to where you want to go in terms of one day achieving financial independence
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.060]   So the way the extreme savers go is say right I'm gonna live super frugally and I'm gonna put away
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.360]   75% of my income so that I one day I will be just living off my
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.320]   Investments and then I will do whatever I want and the unjobbers say right
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.180]   I'm not gonna take on this massive mortgage and you know
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.680]   All of these other things that are more about keeping up with my neighbors
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.280]   What I'm gonna do is say the thing that really matters to me is to work on what I'm passionate about
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.220]   And if that means I'm gonna live super frugally for a while or even with longer term
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:22.100]   That doesn't matter because what's important to me is what's gonna what I'm gonna find fulfilling and yes Elliot Holson in the in the book
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:27.520]   I talk about the interview I did with him where he describes how he talked to his wife about this when he started his business
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.580]   He was saying, you know, if this doesn't work out we might be living in the car
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.440]   But this is something that he they talked through and they they wanted to work out
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.020]   How important was it and what did they what were they willing to sacrifice?
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:44.500]   I think a lot of times it's so easy to just take the default
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:51.740]   Symbols of success, which is the big house the nice car and all of these other things and think right
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.540]   Well, of course, I need those because otherwise I'd be a loser
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:00.620]   And so what I want is I want those and I also want a business that's really exciting and fulfilling to me
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.500]   Or I want to be able to travel and so on and so forth and the key there is to say well really
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:11.660]   You know, how fulfilling is it to you to have that luxury car or that nice house?
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:18.780]   Is it really fulfilling or is it something that you're giving yourself in order to make up for the dreariness?
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.100]   Of the job that you have in order to pay for that stuff
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.520]   Seems like so many of the chains that keep people
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:31.420]   And not everybody who's working a job living in a mainstream lifestyle many people and I get emails from listeners
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.780]   Sometimes I try to remind me and it's important reminders
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.480]   Not everybody who's living in a house with a white picket fence with a three-year-old car working a corporate job
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.260]   They're not living in chains. Okay, so but there are but there are some people who are
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.460]   Just want to recognize that not everyone needs to pursue
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:52.980]   These paths but so many of the chains that keep some people stuck in a place. They don't want to be are mental
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:01.160]   They're not actual they don't actually exist. They're mental chains and it comes down to a scale of
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:08.800]   Priority a ranking of priorities. I have a I have a $5,000 car and have a $500 car and I like to drive my little
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.000]   $500 car there are times when I recognize it's not socially appropriate
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.160]   I like to drive it because it gets me down the road and I often my wife and I were with some friends recently and
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   there's a young couple and
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   We were in there. They had a beautiful house two brand new cars in the in the driveway and
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.920]   We don't talk about money. It's not that kind of relationship
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.200]   I know enough about their financial situation to know that they are not wealthy
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:39.680]   They are enjoying their they're spending their income and I just looked at and I said it's it's not at all
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Attractive to me anymore and my self-worth is now
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:48.280]   sufficient that I can happily pull up in their driveway in my $500 car and
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:55.360]   Happily enjoy the beauty of this nice house and go away with I don't have any envy. I don't have any jealousy
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.720]   I have if anything a sense of
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.920]   Compassion because they're stuck and I'm not it's a mental chain though. It's not a it's not a physical thing
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.020]   It's a mental ability to cross over that hurdle to be okay with
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.840]   with your life choices
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.100]   Yeah, I think I really resonate with everything that you've said there and I think it's really important to you just pick up on the
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:24.280]   first thing you said to make the point that I don't consider jobs to be inherently bad or
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:31.280]   Deloitative or like a bad way to live and in fact jobs are incredibly important and helpful
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:38.240]   especially in the early stages of your career for gaining experience gaining contacts, whatever your plans are whether it's to
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.800]   start your own business or
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.080]   Work towards financial independence through extreme saving or whatever
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.680]   So I think it's really important because sometimes when people want to break out
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.080]   they they can really get a bit polarized between seeing that sort of
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.760]   typical if you like job lifestyle as being
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:02.120]   Inherently bad and then their way as being the only true path and my book is not about that
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.200]   It's about really just challenging the default assumptions
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.380]   You if you if you are happy in your job and you're having a great time and you enjoy spending your money in the way
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.840]   That you're spending it great. The problem is if you have taken on those assumptions
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.480]   typically through schooling especially because we're all
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.360]   Trained to be employees all of our teachers are lifelong employees and they never teach
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.800]   Anything else except how to get a job and keep a job
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.560]   So if you just brought up with those assumptions
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.320]   Then it can get you to the point where without knowing it
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.840]   You have lost the opportunities for freedom that you really could take simply because you've not been you know
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.160]   Able to break out of that paradigm
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.840]   So that's what I'm hoping that this can help do is to give people as you said
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.160]   Especially in the beginning stages a real overview of the different options that are open
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.400]   outside the realm of getting and keeping a good job the
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:06.000]   entrepreneurial options and other options that are about living job free which you're not going to get taught in school and
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.680]   Which you're not going to get taught by university lecturers
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.280]   That so that those type of options are open to all of us and we live in such an amazing
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.880]   Time of opportunity to pursue those options and the sad thing is a lot of people just by default
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:26.360]   Take on these assumptions and get into that lifestyle where before they know it. They've got huge debts
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.960]   they've got a massive mortgage to pay off and they're living on, you know, consumer debt and
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.580]   Paying for things with credit cards and then once you've taken on all of those responsibilities
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.360]   It's it's much harder to really break out of it
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.840]   Which of these four paths to financial freedom is the easiest?
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:52.980]   Well, I think it depends a lot on your character on what you want and on what's gonna make you happy
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:59.860]   I mean for example, I think in some ways if you're really stuck and you don't know what to do
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:06.320]   Then the default option I would suggest is to go for the extreme saving route, you know save
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   Money if you don't yet know what what kind of business you could start or if you don't have the skills
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.560]   or you don't have the contacts then
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:23.120]   Saving is great because first of all, you can just continue along that path and continue until you gradually build up
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.360]   more and more levels of financial freedom, but also
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:34.380]   It gives you the capital to then start your own business or do other things when you do have that in mind and when you do
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.240]   Have that approach so, you know, I think if you're really stuck I would suggest that the saving route is
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:44.660]   The one to go for but then again, it depends on your on your character. I was always
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:50.520]   Really excited by the idea of entrepreneurship that to me was not just a goal
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:59.020]   Finally to achieve financial independence, but that seemed like an amazing awesome opportunity a great adventure that I wanted to do
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.800]   and so the doing of it was a very fulfilling thing for me, too and
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:04.720]   You know
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.280]   in fact
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.200]   the the mentor that I met very early in my teen years who I
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:16.280]   Sort of looked up to was an entrepreneur and I wanted to I saw what he was doing and he had a very clear plan
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.520]   To achieve financial independence through entrepreneurship. So that was a path to me. That was very
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.580]   Tangible I could see that it's possible
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.880]   I could see other people doing it and I wanted to follow it other people just
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.320]   Don't like the idea of being an entrepreneur and for them it wouldn't be the right path
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   So I think that you know as I say, I think in terms of like a default choice
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.400]   I would say the savings if you you know, if you can't think of anything that you want to do
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.960]   otherwise, that's the easiest one to do because
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.560]   even though it's quite hard to live the lifestyle of
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.920]   Extreme frugality. It's relatively straightforward what you actually have to do. You know, it's it's not it's not very complicated
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.880]   You've just you've got to make the savings and that's it
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.920]   Which of the four paths is the most certain?
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.160]   Well again, I would say that the savings route is the one that's most certain because it has the least
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.680]   entrepreneurial
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.400]   risk involved
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:18.820]   Having said that the issue with the savings route and you and I have talked about this before is that it's got a limited upside
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:24.640]   Because there are just limits to how much you're going to be able to save
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.160]   from a job and
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.960]   There are constraints that when you get into entrepreneurship and you build a business the potential upside
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.280]   You know, it's it's bigger and that reflects the fact that it's riskier, too
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:44.480]   so it the the the safest route because it's most under your control is to go for
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.320]   extreme saving in a job where you are
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:54.240]   Able to you know have a fairly steady career and you're just really focused on the things that you control which is getting your own
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.520]   Spending really really under control and and putting away as much as you can if you do that
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.940]   Then you can gradually slowly work your way towards financial independence, but you're not going to be
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:11.280]   Getting nearly as much potential upside for example as if you would do if you become a successful entrepreneur
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:18.040]   Yeah, I feel like I love having the four discrete categories because it's useful to
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.000]   It's useful for people to look at and see
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.080]   Oh there are multiple ways and the reason I ask you about the most certain and the easiest to start with is I think the hardest
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.840]   one to start with and I agree with you it's hard to say and in the string the hardest one to start is with is
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:39.000]   The idea of launching a startup because if you have the idea of launching a startup at least this is my personal experience
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.080]   Goal is I'm gonna launch a startup. I'm gonna build a big business and I'm gonna sell it out for five million bucks
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.700]   Well, you're often looking at ideas and they've got to be big
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.280]   And so it's very frustrating when you're looking around saying what's that idea? What's that idea? What's the idea and
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.440]   Sometimes you don't have the idea. Sometimes the idea comes later
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:05.960]   And so what I spent time doing and I wasted several years by not having the clarity of starting with extreme savings
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.320]   I wasted time constantly looking. What's that big idea and
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.800]   Now in retrospect what I think about your four
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.420]   Categories I almost see them as for as a numbered path to starting
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.560]   So the number one thing is extreme savings because if you have an income
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:28.580]   Then focus on saving as much of that income as is practical for your circumstance
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:35.460]   Now there will be people who will not pursue this because they say I'm just not willing to live that frugal lifestyle
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:41.140]   But many people are and especially many younger people so extreme savings gives you
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:48.580]   Multiple things most especially gives you cash which allows you to more easily make a transition to unjobbing if you would like
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.680]   It's a lot easier to go and move into transient employment
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.720]   If you've got you know, some several thousand dollars at the minimum in the bank
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:00.080]   So you can be a little bit more comfortable with the fact that okay sometime over the next few months
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.220]   I've got a I've got to get a job or I've got to get a temporary gig of some kind
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.140]   So extreme savings leads naturally into unjobbing
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.820]   unjobbing might lead naturally into your discovering and building a lifestyle business and
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:21.220]   Also extreme savings is the foundation for your lifestyle business gives you the ability to take the risk on starting a new business and then
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:27.820]   What might happen is your lifestyle business might have to transition into a startup something that could grow now
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.820]   Not all lifestyle businesses can scale
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.860]   but what I think can happen and
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.580]   I'll use you used right in the first of your paragraph on
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:46.660]   Lifestyle business use the example of Pat Flynn founder of smart passive income. Yeah, so I think Pat started with this and his story
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:52.060]   I'm finding that the path that he's taking is kind of similar to where I'm at
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.820]   His story was he started smart passive income. He started to build a lifestyle business
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.600]   But at this point he could shut the whole thing down and live on live on savings
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:06.000]   But the lifestyle business has become a much bigger business and that's what I'm finding with radical personal finance at this time
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.600]   I could with my family sell all our stuff
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:14.160]   Take my cell phone and a little microphone and create my podcast all around the world and I could make enough for us to move
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.280]   Down and live with you in Panama City, but what I'm finding is I don't really want to do that anymore now
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.880]   I want to build something that's bigger that has a bigger impact and it's not so much the financial motivation
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.040]   It's more of about well, I guess I didn't want to actually quit
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.920]   Yeah, absolutely
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.000]   and I think I mean this is
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.200]   That's Pat is a great example and I used him as one of the examples for lifestyle business because that transition is very clear
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.560]   He was working for an architectural firm and he had a blog and he started to monetize that
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.880]   Well, actually he was made redundant from his architectural firm and he needed a job
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.560]   So cute how you Brit say that he was made redundant. He was fired
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.600]   Very cute and politically correct
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.800]   I always I like that turn of phrase you guys use
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:08.920]   Yeah, so he say he had to get income and he was able to monetize this blog and that was able that's
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:14.320]   Really was something that a lot of people found helpful because it was a blog that was about
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.720]   Passing an exam that a lot of other people were working towards and so this blog was very helpful
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.600]   He was able to monetize it and then he had products spinning off it and as you say that
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:30.600]   Created this passive income lifestyle this lifestyle business and now he's clearly making a lot more
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:36.160]   Than he would need to to pick to carry on and in a way he's doing it because he just loves doing it
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.840]   And I think it's true
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.200]   Also that if you want to do a startup
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:46.600]   Then you have to think about the startup in terms of not this is going to be my ticket to financial independence
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.600]   But am I gonna find this a filling as something to do?
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:55.440]   I mean the same goes for any lifestyle business really because you don't know whether or not you ever will have a business that
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.960]   Does successfully get to the point of being?
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:04.240]   Valuable enough to sell and even then whether or not you'll be able to successfully negotiate a sale and find find a buyer
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.360]   But it so it depends on what you're gonna find for filling in doing it as well
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.920]   And in the same with a lifestyle business
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.880]   You know it might be that it's much harder to make money in one particular
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:20.560]   Industry that you want to start your lifestyle business in and you don't necessarily know that it's gonna be a four-hour workweek
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.680]   You know most lifestyle businesses are not four-hour workweeks
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.320]   They are much more than that and it in a way that that has become a little bit of a myth sometimes
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:35.040]   It's not easy to to get a lifestyle to get a business providing you with that regular income on
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.280]   So little work per week so the question you have got to ask yourself is are you gonna?
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.560]   Enjoy it anyway are you gonna find it fulfilling to have this business?
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.840]   Even if you're working a lot more than four hours a week
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.480]   And if you are then that's fine because you know you're not gonna
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.320]   You're not gonna lose doing the business because it's gonna be interesting to you anyway
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:00.480]   Pretend that I am reading your book, and I'm a 40 year old man or woman and I'm
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:08.440]   Middle income middle America, or I guess it could be middle Europe whatever middle middle class, and I'm sitting there saying well
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.000]   I got you know
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   $20,000 in my 401k
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.040]   But beyond that I don't really have that much
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.280]   How do I sit down and analyze my situation to fit, but I really want to be financially independent
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.760]   How do I sit down and analyze my financial my my sit my?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:28.080]   My path to figure out which of these approaches is best for me
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:35.720]   Well, that's a really good question, and it's interesting that you start with a 40 year old because I think you know the easier case
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.920]   Is and the people who are gain gonna gain most from my book are people who are the 20 year olds?
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.040]   Right because they have a lot more
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.840]   Ahead of them to choose freely as to which path they're going to take in different
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.000]   parts of their life
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.520]   And they may well find that there are some periods in your 20s where extreme saving makes a lot of sense because you don't have
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:01.240]   A lot of experience and then later on you can branch into other things with the 40 year old
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.200]   I think you have to look at where you're at and what you already have in terms of you know
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:12.840]   Your own human capital really I'll give you an example that I mentioned before the the friend of mine
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:19.720]   Who was a management consultant, and he was in his mid-30s when it got to the point where he had such good
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.320]   industry connections that he was able to go freelance and
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:31.200]   He was able to make good money and be there for the birth of his son and for the first couple of years of his
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:31.840]   son's life
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:38.080]   And you know be be much basically be like a stay-at-home dad and yet do a bit of work here and there
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.760]   So for that period of his life undropping was great. You know it's a really good opportunity
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.720]   he was able to build on all of the
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:52.040]   Experience and industry contacts that he'd already gained by that time in his career
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:57.200]   It would have been totally different if he had zero contacts and no you know no chance
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.880]   So I think for that 40 year old you've got to ask yourself
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.960]   Well, what have you got and where you know?
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   What's realistic from where you can go from here because you can start extreme saving at any point in your life
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:14.480]   You know it's just it's actually down to you to decide to make the lifestyle changes to start doing the extreme saving if you do
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.760]   It really intensively then in 10 years you can get to the point of financial independence
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:25.040]   So that 40 year old you know even even though it's actually starting out later within 10 years
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.120]   They could potentially replicate the kind of pattern that people like Jacob Lung Fisker and Mr.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.040]   Money moustache and other people have done there are lots of people that age pursuing that approach
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.400]   But you could also say well as a 40 year old what have you got in terms of your?
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:46.240]   Insights into this industry that you work in what business could you start you know what what could be the opportunities?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:53.920]   And it depends where you're at in terms of things like your kids what other financial responsibilities you have you know you once you get?
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.640]   To that age you've got a lot you're a lot more locked in to the previous decisions that you've made
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.360]   So I hope that my book can be most helpful to people who have
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:08.680]   Two younger people who are thinking about their approaches, but I think at any age you can it's still possible
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.120]   To change your direction, and you can still make incredible changes within you know
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.680]   What is within a lifetime of relatively short amount of time?
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.000]   so pretend you're counseling me again same scenario continuing on and
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.000]   I'm saying Jake I'm 40 years old and I was meeting with my financial advisor
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And I just doing a review of my 401k
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.600]   And I need to be saving more money in my 401k for retirement
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:40.520]   Because I'm gonna be 65 soon and my fear Jake is if I leave this job. I'm gonna lose my 401k and
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.480]   Things are very very uncertain. What do I do about my retirement?
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.160]   Well, I mean this is again a really
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:57.400]   important question that each person has to decide their own approach to risk and to
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.880]   Rewards you know it for me. I started
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:07.160]   Entrepreneurship when I had nothing to lose I had no money
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.680]   Well actually I had some savings that I put into the business that I'd
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.720]   Accumulated through my work, but I didn't have any kids
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.540]   I didn't have a wife and I was able to just go for it
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:23.240]   And I knew that after five or five years or so if it hadn't worked out well
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.160]   Then I would just go and get a job and it wouldn't be such a big deal
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.400]   And I would have still have all of that runway ahead of me
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:35.640]   I think it really depends for the person who's 14 who's really worried about their retirement and
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:42.380]   If they're very risk averse then you know the least risky route is always going to be the extreme savings route
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:49.940]   Because that route is always going to be the route that you you you stay and take advantage of whatever career position that you have
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.440]   But it depends how important it is to you to be job free
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:00.220]   That's what my book is about is about being job free and about living outside of a job and having the freedom
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:05.020]   To to be your own boss to not have somebody else to answer to to decide for yourself
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.080]   How you want to live for some people that's really important
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:14.140]   And it's worth taking some risks for and so you have to you have to decide for yourself
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:19.940]   How risk averse you are and whether or not you've left things to a point where you really need to focus first on saving
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:25.420]   For a while before you do anything else. So I would always say it's got to be an individual decision
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:32.300]   I was very focused on entrepreneurship and I was really willing to just go for it on the understanding that well
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.700]   I could just lose five years of my life on something that doesn't ultimately work out
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.780]   But I'll learn a huge amount in the process and that's that's fine. I'm fine with that
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:45.220]   I didn't mind the risk of failure and I didn't mind the fact that you know
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.780]   That would then be I the end of five years a project that was just done
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:56.460]   Other people find that really really challenging and in some ways that fear of failure is actually what stops a lot of other people
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   from from really trying I
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:04.660]   Have a show title on my list of shows to create haven't done it yet. But the the title is
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.380]   Don't ask yourself the question of what will you do when you retire?
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:13.580]   ask yourself the question, what would you do if you could never retire and
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:20.420]   The idea is why don't we focus first on instead of talking about retiring comfortably?
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.420]   Why don't we talk about working comfortably?
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.020]   Because the constant theme that I see is people who are financially independent
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.700]   Very few of them stop working
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:36.140]   and so this idea that you must be financially independent in order to make the transition is
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.420]   I think it's false and
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.300]   by having these different paths
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:47.860]   You can I guess feel more confident about some of the decisions and then that was where I was kind of bringing in another aspect
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.700]   is
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.460]   retirement
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:56.060]   There are multiple paths to financial freedom and then even in and of itself retirement is it doesn't have to be done
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.340]   even if you don't actually have to be financially free to
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:04.340]   Build a little more of a lifestyle of freedom and and sometimes you might even go backward
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.780]   I had a client of mine who taught me this lesson and I've got a
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:13.420]   The way he taught it to me was I came to do financial planning and I was working on his portfolio
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.860]   But his portfolio wasn't very big
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.420]   but what he was doing is he had shut down a fairly successful business and
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:24.580]   Transitioned into an employee role in the same industry and then he was planning
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.180]   and
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:30.460]   When I first met him and he later did it he was planning to transition from
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.540]   Working as the employee in this business to going back to college as a guy in his mid-40s
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.260]   Going back to college and then getting a job working as a teacher
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:44.420]   because he loved history and he wanted to teach he wanted to teach high school history and
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.700]   he wanted to
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.900]   choose choose teaching so that he would have time to travel and
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.740]   Because teaching was something that he wanted to do and he could do it for a very long period of time
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.820]   and so he was making this transition from
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:03.740]   Kind of the the ends the ideal the big business back to employee and then back to totally different job
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.380]   because the job would would create more of a lifestyle for him and
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.980]   When you see all the different paths
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:18.540]   It blows so many holes in the standard US American approach of work a job 40 years and retire at 65
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.740]   That it's I wonder why anybody but once that path anymore
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.220]   Yeah, absolutely
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.220]   and that's why I
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:34.620]   Chose to focus on the concept of being job free rather than the concept of being financially independent because although financial independence is great
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.300]   It's not the only path to being job free and you can live a fulfilling wonderful life
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:44.260]   You know not being financially independent if you find ways of making ends meet
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.420]   That you know make you happy and that give you fulfillment because that ultimately that's the goal
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:54.100]   Financial freedom for me really is about not having to work in a job that you don't enjoy
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.500]   And if you don't have to work in a job that you that you don't like
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:02.100]   Then you have the freedom to do what you want with your time whether that is more
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:08.620]   Work that earns a lot of money or work that is fulfilling and doesn't earn so much money and in many ways
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.860]   you know it that's the key is that get breaking out of the paradigm of success being essentially
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.940]   Continually earning more and more until you get to the point where you're playing golf as a retiree because ultimately
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.420]   By that time first of all, you know, I don't like golf
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.780]   But by that time, you know
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.180]   You don't have the chance to really enjoy it because you've been stressed out
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.860]   All the way through your career trying to ultimately earn more and more money and I have seen that happen
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:43.740]   I've seen people get into that mindset where success is defined by how many toys you have and how much money you have and
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.660]   For me, you know when I sold my business
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:51.860]   I became a director in the international company that bought my business and I could have continued working there and earning a lot of
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:56.380]   Money and I could have built from that and gone on within the corporate world to you know
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.180]   a higher level corporate job and so forth, but I just didn't want to and I
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:07.620]   When I stopped working when I actually then at the end of the earn out period after I'd helped integrate my company
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:13.740]   you know, I stopped working to do things like travel and write books and do podcasts and
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.940]   These all of these things
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:22.060]   Involved me taking a massive cut in income that I could have had if I'd stayed in that corporate world
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.100]   But I didn't need it because that that money
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:30.660]   Wasn't ultimately gonna be nearly as fulfilling to me as the lifestyle of traveling the world with my wife
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.540]   Seeing all of the amazing beautiful things that there are to see, you know
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.740]   expressing my
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:41.900]   thoughts and hopefully being able to help other people through my books find freedom in their own way and these are the things that
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:49.100]   Bring meaning to my life. So why should I continue earning more? You know when I I have enough to do whatever I want
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:55.940]   Tell us the story of your friend Peter and what you learned by interacting with him and observing his life
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:01.060]   well Peter's story is one that I tell it in the book and
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.340]   and I found that a lot of people have really connected to it because
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:09.820]   Probably because I wanted to explain that I I did have a mentor when I was growing up
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.820]   I I met someone when I was a teenager. I was really trying to understand politics
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.300]   I was asking my parents lots of questions that they weren't able to understand
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:23.540]   They weren't able to answer and my mother suggested that I speak to this guy called Peter who'd previously been active in
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.820]   the same political group as her and
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:31.620]   I went to talk to him and and he would had become totally disillusioned with politics and he was
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.940]   Building a business. He was an entrepreneur and we became good friends
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.820]   And I asked him what his goals in life were
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:46.620]   After after knowing him for a bit and he was very clear and explicit with me that he planned to
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.180]   build a business get to the point of being a millionaire and
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.980]   then retire and
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:59.380]   Just do whatever he wanted which probably wouldn't be very much more than just reading interesting books and and you know having philosophical
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.700]   Conversations these are the kinds of things that he ultimately wanted to do
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.340]   I found that such an incredible thing to hear
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.980]   at that age because
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:13.300]   This was somebody who clearly planned to be a success in his chosen field
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.780]   and then he was just gonna quit and be a successful dropout and
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:22.180]   I'd not heard anyone talk about that and and the other thing that really impressed me was that
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:25.300]   This wasn't just a dream that you wanted to be a millionaire
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:29.780]   he was seriously planning it and he was absolutely going for it and
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:36.140]   Everything that he was doing with building his own business was leaning towards this goal and he was serious about implementing it
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:41.300]   you know, this wasn't just idle talk and that also made a huge impression on me because I I
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:48.260]   From took from that that you know, it's okay to take this seriously and to believe in doing it
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.540]   And not just to treat it like oh, wouldn't it be nice one day, you know
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.940]   And so that made a huge impression on me and in many ways
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:00.940]   Slowly it took time for it all to sort of sink in and I spent a lot of time in university
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.780]   I did postgraduate studies and eventually I did it even did a PhD
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:11.340]   But when I left university, I started my own business and I very much was following in his path
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.340]   he was an inspiration to me and
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:18.740]   I was following in this idea to that I could live a life free of jobs
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:23.140]   I could build my own business work for myself and then I could also at some point just
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.900]   Retire early or do whatever I want with my time
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:32.740]   What was interesting to me? So that was my mentor and in many ways by writing this book
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.140]   I'm hoping that other people can can see
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:41.580]   Lots of stories of people who've done this and this is one of the things about the book is to present not just Peter's story
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.940]   But different stories from other people who have interviewed of who've done this in their own way
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:50.420]   But an interesting thing happened with Peter which is that later on?
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:56.860]   After I'd been working very hard and building my own business. I finally managed to meet up with Peter again
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:02.820]   I hadn't seen him for a long time because I'd borrowed money from him to start my business. He'd been incredibly supportive and
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:09.420]   What I found when I met up with him again is that he was now a multi-millionaire
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:14.700]   He'd blown way past his original dream of becoming a millionaire. He was still making more and more money
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:19.620]   he was incredibly successful living in a mansion and he was incredibly unhappy and
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:27.100]   You know what happens that he had his goals had changed and he became more and more interested in
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.900]   the sort of more like
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.460]   outward shows of success
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   Having the luxury car having the mansion
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:41.140]   Having lots and lots of women that he was seeing and lots of lots of women who were interested in him
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.660]   He gave up on love and he just wanted to you know, basically
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.260]   sleep with lots of beautiful women
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.740]   Which he was able to do because there were always lots of people who are interested in someone who's obviously very rich and successful
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   like that, but what I saw was that he was unhappy and that his life, you know was not fulfilling to him and
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:04.940]   That made a huge impression on me too because I never gave up on his original dream
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:10.100]   Which it was always a big inspiration to me and I think it's really important to ask yourself
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.700]   How much is enough and what you really want? Do you want money or do you want freedom?
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:21.740]   And for me, it was always freedom and money is just a means to achieve more freedom in life
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.740]   and so, you know, I
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:30.940]   Had a mentor who was a great inspiration to me and who also was an inspiration again in a way because he changed course and our
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   Lives went in the end went in different parts, but I still learned a huge amount from it
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.540]   I'd like to ask you a philosophical question
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.300]   you
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.020]   You're writing these this book and and
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:52.660]   Exploring these concepts which are expressing the fact that money as a goal in and of itself is rarely fulfilling
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:57.620]   Rather it's a tool and then you've described the story of you walking away from it
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.180]   but philosophically
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.780]   I believe that
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:06.460]   Although you write in the book that at 13 years old you were trying to become a Marxist at this point
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:11.460]   I would say that philosophically you see the value of a capitalist economy
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:13.380]   and
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:17.060]   I'm curious. How do you integrate this these seemingly?
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.380]   opposing
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:25.260]   Philosophies the one idea being in capitalism by pursuing our own economic self-interest and by building our fortunes
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:32.540]   We are we're motivated by that. That's commonly how it's perceived with the other being well if we build our happiness and
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.660]   Do that than that then we've got enough. How do you integrate these two seemingly opposing philosophies?
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:46.660]   Well, you know, I think so yeah, you're right just just to explain I the reason I originally wanted to
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:51.420]   Ask Peter lots of questions was that I was trying to understand socialism
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:57.300]   My parents were socialist and I wanted to be one too and I was reading Karl Marx's Das Kapital and trying to make sense of it
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:03.260]   and Peter was actually someone who was incredibly well read and and so and had previously been
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:10.620]   Interested a Marxist and been interested in all this stuff and it was through our conversations that I realized that none of that stuff made
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:16.860]   Any sense not only was it logically flawed but also incredibly destructive ideology and Peter recognized that too
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.580]   Which is something that I really admired
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.260]   But see he had the integrity
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:25.940]   When we talked about it under questioning to to acknowledge the faults in the arguments and to acknowledge how destructive they were
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.180]   But I also think that that does not mean that
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.940]   You know
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.940]   Entrepreneurship is all about
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.380]   Grabbing as much as you can and that you know, the one with the most toys wins
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:43.420]   So to speak what I see it as is it's the opportunity to live freely
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:50.980]   Which it means that you choose for yourself what is important in terms of what you consume, you know, if you want to consume
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:57.540]   Luxury goods if that's what makes you happy do it. I don't think there's anything evil or wrong with that
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:03.460]   Personally, I just don't think it's a very wise choice given it the cost benefits for myself
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.740]   It doesn't make any sense. You know, I I have
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.660]   never owned a car and I don't miss it and
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:16.900]   Up until the time when I was financially independent. I never owned any property
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:23.860]   I only stayed in a small rented apartment and I eventually bought a place once I once I'd sold my business
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:29.980]   But I didn't miss it. It wasn't important to me. And so what I see is as really what's so
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.460]   exciting about
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:35.260]   entrepreneurship and about the ability to
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:43.900]   Be an entrepreneur on the market and provide value to others is you can choose at what level you find
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.500]   Fulfillment if you find fulfillment having a tiny
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:56.460]   Lifestyle business that brings you just enough income to live in a low-cost place like Mexico or somewhere else
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.460]   And you know and you're having a great time
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:03.780]   Good for you. I think that's a wonderful way to live if you want to build
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:09.140]   You know the next billion dollar business and that's what you think is gonna be super exciting
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.460]   Then fine good for you, too
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:17.060]   I think it's it's a question of your choice and your freedom and nobody
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.260]   It's not a question of you know on the one hand
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.340]   everyone has to
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:26.620]   We have to collectivize everything and and and you know
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:31.540]   Nobody should have anything more than anyone else on the other hand somehow a free market approach is more that oh
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:36.180]   You just everyone's got to grab as much as they possibly can I think in in the in the?
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:42.420]   the freedom that matters to me is the freedom to choose for yourself and for everyone to have the choice of the
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:47.060]   Lifestyle that makes most sense to them and I think money is an incredibly valuable tool
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:53.640]   But not the end in itself. And so that that's sort of how I see that philosophical difference
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.640]   yeah, I think that's a good point and and
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.620]   That's where the distinction
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.740]   Where when you get into political philosophy and political ideology?
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:11.540]   Many times I've seen that the wealthiest people tend to be extremely generous and what is frustrating to people who especially who are wealthy is
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:17.980]   That it's it's it's when it's their choice to be generous taxation is not charity
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.980]   taxation is
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:26.180]   Staffed at the end of a gun and so regardless of whether it's taxation to support
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:29.660]   the president's White House in the United States or
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:37.340]   Whatever the equivalent is in the UK or whether it's taxation to support the global war machine or whether it's taxation to give to the poor
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.020]   person down the street
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:44.460]   The reason doesn't matter. It wasn't a voluntary choice. So that's very different than
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.700]   generosity and charity
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:54.260]   Which many many people find at least many people wealth people who I've worked with they find a deep sense of meaning and purpose
[00:59:54.260 --> 01:00:00.380]   behind that so often people just see those political ideologies or those philosophies as
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:05.180]   The whole idea of capitalism is to get as much money as you can. Well, that's that's not true
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:11.500]   It's it's the freedom of choice as you describe go ahead. Yeah, not only that but also the thing that's really exciting to me
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:17.980]   Is that being an entrepreneur and you know, most of these job free lifestyles have some element of entrepreneurship in them
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:24.660]   You know that is about providing value. That's how the world gets better that these are positive
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.700]   Non-political things that you can do to make a real impact on the world
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:36.220]   Not only is it great to achieve as much freedom as you can in your own life to find fulfillment
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:40.780]   But I see true entrepreneurship the kind where you you know
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.020]   You're a genuine entrepreneur providing value to others as how the world gets better
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:50.180]   That is how we have all of the great benefits of all of the innovation and you know
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:54.260]   Amazing things that the power our lifestyle today is through entrepreneurs
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.380]   it's entrepreneurs that brought those things to the world because
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:03.220]   Everything through entrepreneurship is voluntary and one of the great benefits to me of living a job-free lifestyle
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:07.660]   Is that you get to choose according to your own ethics?
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.780]   How you make money and what you think is the right way to live?
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:17.140]   Derek Sivers makes this point in his book about his business that when you start your own business
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.540]   You're creating your own little utopia. It's up to you to decide how people should be treated
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:28.260]   You know what you consider to be decent and the right way to live and you you can do it
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.980]   You can choose to do good in your own way by providing value voluntarily
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:40.300]   And you don't have to you know put up with any nonsense from an employer who may have a vision
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:46.060]   That's different to yours who you may think they don't have as much integrity as you if you have any
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.940]   If there's any question of the integrity of the business
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:56.780]   It's down to you and it's your responsibility to do that and that's both a challenge and a wonderful opportunity. Yeah, that's
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:06.340]   You've said it well and that's what's so frustrating to me about most modern political conversation is
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.180]   What has happened in our modern era is we've come to the point where?
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:18.140]   People often say well the way that we make change is I force my desired change on everyone else and then everything will be fine
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:23.620]   Instead of people saying I'm just gonna go make change. That's why I one of the reasons why I love entrepreneurship
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.780]   There's a famous story forget the guy's name in this business, but there was the guy who?
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.620]   CEO of a company up in the Northwest Pacific Northwest in the United States who?
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:38.140]   Cut his salary his his very high salary and cut his salary down to seventy five thousand dollars
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:42.500]   Increased all of us employees wages massively and he had all the all the news
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.320]   Great, you know all the these laudatory news
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:52.300]   Stories about how wonderful the CEO was for this decision and I fully supported his actions
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.940]   but what made me so frustrated and watching the scenarios like that was that
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:01.740]   Everyone automatically wanted to use that as a
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:10.220]   Reason to employ violence against everyone else or the threat of violence and say well, that's why you should do that
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.180]   So instead of saying hey, let this guy lead by example and good for him. It's his money. He made the choice
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.740]   It's automatically well, we've got a cap all the other CEOs pays. We got a cap everyone else
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:25.220]   We've got to automatically take our perspective and up and and force it on to everyone else and it's a major
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.100]   It's a major problem in the modern society that we automatically
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:34.620]   Think of using force and saying I'm gonna force everyone else to do what I think is right instead of simply saying
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.460]   I'm just gonna go do it. I'm gonna show you how I do it
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.460]   I'm gonna run my business the way that I want to run it
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.100]   And if you want to see change you go run your business the way that you want to run it
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.020]   Yeah, I think anytime you see a problem in the world
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:53.980]   The the most productive question you can ask is how could I?
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.860]   create a venture that would voluntarily
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:04.820]   Help this problem be solved and you know, if if you're if you're right, then you've seen entrepreneurial
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:11.140]   Opportunity if you see that there's a pain point in the way that people live and that it could be made better
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.700]   You know, you could save people time. You could save people
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:22.460]   Heartache you could save people whatever it is. Then there's an entrepreneurial opportunity there and the really the the way with real
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:29.780]   Integrity to try and help is to actually do it voluntarily which which ultimately means start your own business and and help people
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.220]   And if you do help people they'll pay for it and it will fund the business and it will you know
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.380]   Fund the whole venture forward in terms of making an impact on the world. This is in fact
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:44.220]   For me the most fulfilling aspect of entrepreneurship, you know, the financial independence is wonderful
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.500]   But I suggest that whether it's a lifestyle business or a startup
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.420]   I think if you do it because you are excited about making a difference
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.620]   You know and in your case Joshua
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:01.420]   You are obviously excited about helping people achieve a better control of their finances and more financial freedom
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:07.740]   Then the money is great. But every day that you do this you're really living your purpose
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:15.060]   Which is a wonderful way to live. Yeah, Jake as you were writing and researching and now finishing the publication of this book
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.580]   What was probably the biggest?
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.860]   Change in your mindset
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.580]   What was the thing that stood out to you as you were going through and editing and editing and editing where you said wow
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:31.180]   I didn't quite see that before I started this project, but now I really I really see this point. I
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.740]   think what changed for me is that I
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.820]   Through doing this research, you know
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:45.020]   I I started from a position of being an entrepreneur and I very much was in the start up route and I saw
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.100]   Or that as I mentioned before my mentor
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:54.060]   The person I looked up to had taken this route I saw that as
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:06:00.300]   freedom and what I realized the more people I interviewed on my podcast of voluntary life and
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:06.660]   Found that the more I found that there were other people who would achieve their own sense of freedom and their own job-free lifestyle
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.940]   In different ways the more I realized that you know, this is not it's not just my way
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:17.380]   There are other ways to do this and the more I realized also how often there isn't that much overlap between these different
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.860]   communities of people who have found ways to live job free
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:26.580]   I think your podcast is an interesting one because you speak about all of these different approaches with different people
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:33.540]   But often you know, there's there is not that much overlap for example between start-up entrepreneurs and extreme savers
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:39.740]   I think in many ways those two communities don't really know each other and they don't I don't think that the extreme savers have much
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.620]   Of an insight as to what it is like to be a start-up entrepreneur
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.460]   And I don't think the start-up entrepreneurs have much of an insight as to what it is like to be an extreme saver
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:48.980]   And yet in many ways
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:54.500]   I think they share many similar values and many opportunities to learn from each other and I certainly found
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.260]   that I learned a huge amount by looking at these other approaches and
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:01.860]   Seeing you know the the the ways that you can find freedom
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:08.420]   and so now I like to to pick and choose and take from all of these approaches the things that are meaningful to me and
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.300]   Philosophically I can learn a huge amount from all of them
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.260]   But that's what happened to me through doing the research for the book
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.620]   Was it really opened my mind to the different options that are out there? I
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:21.620]   Love the book. I'll just as a
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.780]   Absolute endorsement here. Oh Jake sent me an advance review copy and I sent him back a little blurb for his publicity
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:35.940]   And i'll just read my blurb. Here's what I sent him. I said this book is a required introductory text for anyone who is interested in achieving
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.860]   financial independence
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.860]   You will save years of misdirected work
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:46.580]   If you begin with a clear plan and jake's book provides the outlined plan that you need the book is really really good
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.740]   It's very concise
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.380]   The estimated length on amazon is 96 pages
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:59.860]   The price is great right now on amazon. I'll put a direct link to the book through it radical personal finance.com slash job free
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:05.780]   So radical personal finance.com slash job free or i'll put that link in the the notes and blog post for today's post
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:11.780]   But it's it's 3.99 on kindle right now, and it's also part of the kindle unlimited package
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:17.300]   So if you are a subscriber to kindle unlimited, uh, get over to job free and check the book out. I'd love to see
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:22.980]   The book, uh really grow and rise in popularity because I think you've written something that's incredibly useful
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:27.240]   Uh, jake and again, it's it's for anyone who's interested in financial independence
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.900]   Take a I don't know. What do you think it takes an hour to read hour and a half?
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.980]   I mean, it's not it's 100 pages. So
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.940]   um
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:37.860]   Take yeah, you can read it. You can read it in in an afternoon if you if you want if you're interested
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:42.100]   I've had people who've told me that actually that they just read it in one sitting because they were really interested
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.340]   Yeah, you can and it's it's just so
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.980]   clear to provide those outlines
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.380]   because it provides
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.660]   The choice that that people need
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:59.460]   And exactly the point that that you've said throughout this interview many times people say well this path is the right one and and and
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.780]   and they don't recognize that
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:07.540]   There are many paths and so for some people extreme savings. That's all they need some people unjobbing is all they need
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:12.180]   I've gone through the transition. I started with the goal of creating lifestyle business
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.500]   um now i'm
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   Moving on to kind of the startup world
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:22.580]   And and you can pursue all of them, but but the key is by having them identified in your mind. You will be empowered
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.140]   uh with
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:30.900]   The ability to look at your own situation and judge what's best for you. So jake I thank you for writing the book
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:36.900]   Uh, thank you for coming on the show. Uh also mentioned. Let's see. You've got the podcast. Is it the voluntary life.com?
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.620]   I think you would the yes. Okay. So the voluntary life.com
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.020]   podcast the voluntary life podcast
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.420]   Um, and if you're interested in in a really great

[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.540]   Thank you so much. Joshua. It's been really fun talking to you
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:59.720]   Your homework now is to take the information in today's show and to think about your different options
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:05.060]   Expect those options to change
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:12.100]   When I started I had done a little bit of savings but not extreme savings and I was primarily focusing on building the lifestyle business
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:16.740]   Now that i've built the lifestyle business and that's starting to to function now
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:21.380]   I'm looking at saying well, am I really creating a startup or am I just building a bigger business? I don't know
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.060]   But if you think about these different options
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:28.100]   I believe you can use all of them at different points in your life depending on where you are and having them
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.140]   Firmly in mind will help you
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.860]   You know unjobbing you want to go travel the world don't have a lot of money figure out an unjobbing gig that you can do
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.940]   so
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.720]   I hope you can gain inspiration from the different stories and the different strategies
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:45.140]   And then you can design whichever one of these strategies is the best for you
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:49.540]   I strongly urge you to go and check out jake's book. It's well worth the money
