[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Today on the show, I've got a special guest.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.360]   We bring back the most popular interview in radical personal finance history.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.080]   We bring back Curtis Stone, the urban farmer extraordinaire.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.560]   He's the guy who, remember, profits 80,000 bucks farming a third of an acre.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.680]   Pretty cool.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.120]   But even more cool is he claims he can actually teach anybody to do it.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.240]   If my memory is correct, he claims he can teach anybody
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.760]   how to take a $5,000 investment and turn it into $50,000 in about a year or so.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:18.160]   ♪
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.880]   I guess I probably should have said, though, "for clarity," with a lot of hard work involved.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.960]   Good morning. This is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.120]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.720]   Today is Tuesday, January 27, 2015.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.160]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.240]   Curtis Stone is back.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.720]   And this one's fun.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.520]   Perhaps not quite as much grit as we wanted to, but a lot of interesting conversation.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.480]   ♪
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.640]   I think you're really going to enjoy this conversation.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.400]   When we started off, we intended to kick it off and really present to you a blueprint of basically
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.720]   how you can follow in his footsteps and build your own urban farm with some practical steps.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.320]   And that's where the interview started.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.840]   It wound up being much more business-minded, much more philosophy-minded, much more of
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.640]   basically just a conversation between two people we've never met, but we seem to have a lot in
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.160]   common, and it's pretty fun.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.400]   I think you're really going to enjoy this.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.360]   It's not ranting, but it is a lot of philosophy, and I thought it was just really interesting
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.760]   what came out in the conversation.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.960]   If you've not heard, as I say in just a moment, if you've not heard the previous episode with
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.760]   Curtis, make sure to go back and listen to that first.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.080]   In short, his story is that he set off and was a fairly idealistic man in his youth,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   and then he went out and decided he was going to start farming.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.440]   He looked at different ways.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.680]   He thought about getting involved in agriculture and various methods.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   But ultimately, he hit on the idea of becoming an urban farmer, and he started with spin
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.360]   farming, and he's since developed his own approach, I guess.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.200]   And he started to transition.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.840]   He's learned a lot over the last five years, but runs a very small, very efficient, debt-free
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.280]   farm, farming right in the middle of the city on borrowed backyards, basically, selling
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.480]   to his neighbors.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.680]   And he runs a very efficient, very productive business.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.360]   Go back and listen to the previous episode if you haven't.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.040]   That would be a good step.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.280]   It would be episode 40.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.720]   And then, welcome to the interview.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.400]   Curtis, welcome back to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.560]   I appreciate your coming back.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.600]   Really happy to be here.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.800]   So I don't know whether you're surprised or I'm surprised, but here I am, Mr. Fancy Pants
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.600]   Financial Planner.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.520]   I figure my most popular show is going to be one of my brilliant financial strategies
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.600]   and one of my in-depth teachings on the intricacies of how to exploit all the little loopholes
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.160]   in the law to improve.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.800]   And your episode, our interview, by far is the most popular show I've ever done.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.080]   It's been downloaded almost 19,000 times and just the most response of any of the shows
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.680]   that I've done by a wide margin.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.640]   So congratulations.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.040]   You're officially the most popular guest on the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.440]   Wow.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.880]   That's amazing.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.480]   Well, that and $4.58 might get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.640]   But I know the interview, and if anyone hasn't heard it, I would recommend prior to this
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.120]   interview, because we're going to kind of build on the last one, go back and listen
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.760]   to it.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.360]   And episode 40, so you can find it at radicalpersonalfinance.com/40.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.280]   The title was "Making $80,000 on a third of an acre with an urban farm without owning
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   land."
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.240]   And that's kind of your story.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.480]   So I don't want to spend a lot of time going back through that.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.760]   I'm just going to ask anyone who hasn't heard it, go back and listen to how Curtis
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.760]   starts his, how he borrows and rents all of his backyards in the middle of the city on
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.600]   which he farms and has a small and profitable operation.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.440]   It's well worth listening to.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.320]   It's episode 40.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.920]   Listen to that before this show.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.040]   But I want to build on that and just simply say I have heard from several aspects of several
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   listeners who your show just really was a transformative eye-opening experience for
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.400]   them.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.960]   And several of them are following in your footsteps.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.880]   And so what I'd love to do today is kind of build on that and give some ideas for how
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.080]   people can grow.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   Yeah, that sounds great.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.640]   I'll give you one example just that I pulled up.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.080]   I received this a couple weeks ago from a listener.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   And the listener is in Kansas City.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.960]   And he says, you know, I was asking about their goals.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.400]   I've been doing some listener polling a little bit recently.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.440]   And he said, you know, that my goals have changed since I was introduced to Curtis Stone
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.880]   through your podcast.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.120]   So while we're focused on keeping and growing our current incomes, we're only going to be
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.680]   investing in our 401ks up to the match.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   And then we are going to be investing excess funds and time into a farming or gardening
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.240]   business.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.600]   We won't be taking on any debt or dipping into our emergency funds as long as we're
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.120]   both fully employed, no matter how good or bad the farming is going.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.360]   And I'm going to sell at least $3,000 of food in 2015.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.920]   I'm not worrying about 401ks.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.120]   I'm focusing on building up this new business.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.160]   So you got at least one.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.280]   I've received other emails from listeners that I didn't pull up that it's making an
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.680]   impact, which must make your heart feel good.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   Oh, totally.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.520]   And I, to be honest, I've been hearing a lot of that stuff lately.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.800]   I've gone out, done a lot of press, especially over the last year.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.120]   And it's been incredible, the response.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.280]   And I mean, nothing tells you more than you know you're on the right path when you're
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.600]   having success in your own personal life, but you're also helping people improve their
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.480]   lives.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.040]   And that's what it's all about.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:58.000]   I mean, I wish more people could tune into that and do the same thing themselves.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.680]   Yeah, it's been, I mean, since I released the show, and I know one of the things we'll
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.800]   make sure to give details on at the end, but I wanted to get you on before your Florida
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.320]   tour, you're coming to Florida and you're doing a tour of, well, let's start with that
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.600]   and then we'll get into the meat.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.680]   So you're coming to Florida and you're doing a tour in Orlando and Gainesville?
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.560]   Yeah, so I'm actually leaving for Florida tomorrow.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.400]   So Tuesday, I'll be there tomorrow night.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.960]   Right.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.560]   We have an evening lecture that's free in Gainesville on January 28th.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.760]   It's about two hours and there'll be some question and answer stuff.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:37.040]   And then we've got the next day, on the 29th, we've got a full day workshop in Gainesville.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.120]   And then the 31st until February 1st, we've got a two day workshop in Orlando.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.120]   And then right after that, I head over to Long Beach, California, and I've got a couple
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   more US dates in there as well.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.280]   Awesome.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.560]   And this is going to be cool.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.280]   And I know if people, I probably shouldn't have put it up here at the front, but if listeners
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.040]   haven't heard the previous, it's not going to be relevant for them.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.640]   But I know I've got a friend, we're going to at some point get you here to West Palm.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.920]   I've got a friend that I've been working with locally, who we're trying to build out some
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.640]   of the local food infrastructure in West Palm.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.280]   I've got more ideas than ability, than bandwidth to do it right now.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.120]   But I'm at least going to try to do that.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.160]   If I can, I'm going to get up.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.680]   I'm not sure if I will, but if I can, I'm going to get up to Orlando to see you if I can.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.800]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.120]   We'll see.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.320]   So let's get started.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.200]   So let's use this example listener of mine from Kansas City, 31 years old, husband, father
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.360]   of a beautiful 13-month-old girl.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   And he's trying to get started with urban farming.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.520]   And let's use him as an avatar, as a proxy for our listener.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.440]   If somebody is interested in following in your footsteps and building out an urban farm,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.080]   you've got the experience now and you've made a lot of mistakes.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.560]   Where do we start and how do we go about building that type of enterprise?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.320]   Well, there's a lot of things that I teach people, obviously.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:13.840]   But some things that I've realized recently, even in my own personal life, is to kind of
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.320]   start with a little bit of the personal motivation on people's end.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   And there's five pieces of advice I usually give all of my people that
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   attend my lectures and workshops.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.600]   Before you start looking at all the details, to go step by step through the process.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.280]   Because it can seem daunting.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.440]   And then people will hear me on this show or they'll come to my lectures and people
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.320]   will often say to me, "Wow, this is so cool.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.160]   I've never been so excited about something.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.440]   But man, you must just be really talented at this.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.960]   And what about the average person?
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.200]   How can this work for the average person?"
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.720]   And usually I just say, "Stop right there immediately.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.200]   Don't put me on a pedestal.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.280]   Don't put yourself beneath me.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.360]   Don't put yourself beneath anybody."
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.440]   Number one, you got to believe in yourself.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.000]   Because unless you're ready to-- unless you can do that, all of these things will seem
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   daunting.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.320]   And I got to tell you, Josh, when I started this, I was totally daunted.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.840]   And I was totally burnt out.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:18.240]   And I made so many ridiculous mistakes that I felt embarrassed when I would tell other
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.600]   farmers about things that I was doing.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.920]   It was a joke.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.360]   But the thing that I learned over time is you got to fake it till you make it.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.000]   You got to just put one foot in front of the other and just give her all you got.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.640]   And when you do that, when you start going in motion and you start having little small
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.280]   successes here and there, people will really start to push you along because they'll see
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.160]   what you're doing and they'll get inspired and then they'll want to help you.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.800]   And if you make it easy for people to help you, then you'll have people in your neighborhood
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.640]   and community helping you all the time.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.880]   And so that was-- one thing that was huge for me was just like believe in yourself.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.280]   There's some other things, too, that I think are really important for people getting started
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.680]   is follow the path of least resistance.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.600]   And so what I mean by that is that if you keep running into roadblocks with certain
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.960]   things, then be more like water and flow like water.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.640]   Water doesn't push its way through things.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.680]   It works around.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.560]   And so a lot of people in my sector come in with big ideological plans like, "I want
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.040]   to-- it's the whole save the world mentality," which is good.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.880]   And I have that myself.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   But you got to put your ideology in your back pocket a little bit for a while and just get
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.000]   some small successes.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.800]   Because if you say, "Okay, I want to go to living off the grid, growing on my own food,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.880]   producing on my own energy, all this kind of stuff.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.520]   I want to make my own biofuel," or whatever it is, start with something simple and get
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.960]   some successes and move forward.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   Don't just shoot for these big ideas and then be discouraged because it just seems so daunting.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   So just start small.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.400]   You know?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.920]   - That one is my disease.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.400]   And it's so convicting for me.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.080]   I'm very much a big picture.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.440]   So I love-- I've got my little property here in West Palm.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.640]   It's about a half acre.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.480]   And I just think, "Oh, I can transform this thing into a tropical paradise.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.560]   And I could do this and that."
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.120]   And I've got everything worked out in my mind.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.840]   But in the meantime, as I sit here, I look out my window and my garden bed, my little
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   four-foot by eight-foot, poor little garden bed, is chock full of weeds.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.560]   It's completely neglected this entire-- winter is our growing season.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:39.040]   And every single day, I sit here just hustling like crazy, trying to build this new business,
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   trying to build the show, trying to get all the things that keep all my balls in the air
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.920]   that I'm trying to do.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.840]   In the meantime, I look out there and I see this puny little four-by-eight-foot garden
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.800]   bed full of weeds, not planted, missing my entire growing season because I'm working
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.080]   from sunup till sundown.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.240]   - Well, and that's it, right?
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.120]   And that's where people often fail.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.520]   And that's where I failed is when I started, I took on way too much.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   And it was just like trying to balance 100 things at once.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.480]   And then I just had a hard time getting ahead.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.000]   Because one thing I've learned is, at least for myself, is multitasking is a joke.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.240]   Like multitasking is this thing that everybody thinks that they should do because we live
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.840]   in this culture of, you know, be busy, have lots of stuff going on.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.760]   But it's like you just have so many things, you're balancing so many things at once, you
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.880]   just can't get any particular thing done and done really well.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.200]   - Right.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   - So I think it's like important to set these goals and achieve a goal and then move on
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.560]   to the next one.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.360]   But don't move on to the next one until you get one done.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.840]   And so it's, you know, kind of working through these things.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.800]   And maybe in your case, it's like, you know, have a small garden and just make that happen.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:46.960]   - Right.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.920]   - And forget everything else, but just make that one happen.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.120]   Get some successes there, learn some knowledge, get that feedback loop with the natural environment
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.520]   that you're in.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.960]   And just go from there, then go on to the next thing.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.680]   - Right.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   Yeah, I pretty much decided that the only way it's going to get done is, A, if I have simply
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   chosen that I can't do it all and I've got to get some other stuff squared away.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.440]   But I've just, the big one that gets me is the daylight.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.960]   And, you know, I get to the end of the day around five, six o'clock and I'm ready to
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.080]   quit and it's dark.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.720]   And so I've just got to readjust my schedule and go out at noon.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.600]   - Yeah.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   - Work in the garden at noon for 30 minutes or something.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.640]   Just do 30 minutes, get away from the computer, get away from the work and plant and harvest
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.520]   some vegetables.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.160]   - Yeah, I think it's, you know, I've been trying to just change my morning routine as
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.480]   well.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.160]   And I listen to, you know, Pat Flynn, Smart Passive Income, and, you know, some of these
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.240]   other guys that talk about how important a morning routine is, you know.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.400]   And so one thing I've been trying to get into is I get up and for the first four hours,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.040]   I don't read emails, I don't get distracted by things, I just get into what I'm doing.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.320]   And I try to involve exercise into that.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.400]   So, I mean, right now I've got a foot of snow on the ground.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.320]   It's starting to melt now, finally.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.800]   But, you know, I set my bike trainer up in my living room and I get on my bike for a
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.040]   while.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.120]   And one thing that's the best though is if the weather's kind of nice, is to go outside
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.000]   and just be outside for a bit and just get your hands in the dirt or just feel connected
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.800]   and then come back.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.640]   And for me, I mean, I'm working on a bunch of different stuff right now.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.560]   I've got a book coming out on a major publishing house this fall and I've got an online course
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.760]   called Profitable Urban Farming coming out next month.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.560]   And I've been working on a computer for like ever since the fall.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.800]   And I'm sure, you know, similar case to you, but I find I've got to break my day up.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.520]   And when I'm on a computer for, you know, 12 hours of the day, I've got to like every
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.120]   couple hours, I've got to get up and do something.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.880]   I built myself a stand-up desk.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.480]   So that's helped.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.560]   But, you know, just get outside and just do something with my hands.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.960]   And I often find that my creativity really comes out when I'm doing something with my
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.840]   hands.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.440]   And sometimes I'll just sit at the computer screen and stare at it for an hour and not
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.320]   write a word.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.720]   And then some days I'll write 7,000 words in a day.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.920]   But it's like I got to break it up and get outside and active.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.640]   - So what would be the type of goal that you would encourage someone to set?
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.160]   Would it be like my listener said, I want to make $3,000 in 2015?
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.760]   Would you start with a monetary goal?
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.680]   Would you start with a goal crafted differently?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   How would you apply that to your business?
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.520]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.880]   I think really, before you make goals, you got to figure out, you know, what's your outcome?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   Like what are you looking to do with this?
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.800]   Are you looking to be a farmer so you can kind of take control of your family's, you
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.640]   know, nutritional intake?
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.080]   Are you somebody who wants to start transitioning to making a living as a farmer?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.920]   You know, first paint out what that is.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.480]   Set those targets to be like, yeah, what does this look for me?
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.600]   And so let's just say, for example, if it is I want to make a living at this, then,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.160]   you know, depending on your situation, I mean, when I started farming, I went, I jumped right
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.200]   in with both feet.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.320]   I took a huge risk.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.720]   But some people aren't willing to do that.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.840]   So I think if, and if they're not, maybe they're in a better situation where they don't have
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.000]   to.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.960]   If you can hold your day job for a while and transition into something, set a monetary
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.200]   goal.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.280]   Like say, you know, you've got a quarter acre in production or that you can set up
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.400]   into production.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.520]   That's a good place to start.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   I think a quarter acre is the most amount of land that anybody who's going to start
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.080]   doing farming should start with if you don't have any previous experience.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.800]   And just say, OK, the main goal here is let's, we'll keep our day jobs.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.600]   We'll work on this on the weekends and maybe two or three hours a day.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.120]   We'll do a farmer's market once a month or something like that.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.760]   And then set a goal like let's try to make $5,000 from the farm this year.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.520]   And, you know, that can subsidize our income a little bit.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.280]   And then we'll scale it up the next year.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.800]   And then maybe you can start scaling your hours back at your previous job or maybe just
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.680]   go for it.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.360]   I think there's a lot of benefit in just jumping in and taking the risk because humans are
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.480]   incredibly adaptable.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.720]   Right.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   I mean, we are resilient creatures.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.080]   We've survived on this planet for a long time now.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.600]   And we've gone through all kinds of atrocities, natural disasters.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.520]   When we have to make things happen, we make it happen.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.600]   And I think everybody has that ability in them.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.400]   And I don't believe anybody when they say they don't.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.280]   Because when it comes to survival, you're going to survive.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.640]   And I'm not suggesting you go and throw everything on the line or do it the way I
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:42.880]   did.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.800]   But, you know, take some risks.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.520]   Put yourself in a little bit of a position where it's like, yeah, OK, we're taking this
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.000]   seriously.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.880]   This isn't just Mickey Mouse and around.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.960]   This is serious business.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.720]   Even if it's like, OK, a modest goal.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.880]   Let's make a few thousand dollars from the garden this year.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.480]   And let's do a farmer's market once a month.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.680]   Let's talk to a couple, a restaurant or two and just see what kind of stuff we can sell
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.120]   and get things going that way.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.960]   Well, the reality is also much of the challenge is in making the decision to do
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.440]   something.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.040]   Oh, huge.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.520]   If you think about I like to interview people that that go off on big trips and go off on
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.400]   a sailing adventure.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.160]   And I don't remember where this came from.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.800]   I think it was a book.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.640]   And the guy was saying the biggest decision is the one that's done two years before.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.120]   Two years before when you decide I'm going to go sail around the world.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.960]   And that's made two years before you leave.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.160]   After that, it's just a process of going through things.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.200]   And I think even in my own life, whether it's the decision to to get married or to leave
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.280]   a job and start a business or to leave a business and go to job, whatever it is, the hard thing
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.000]   is the decision.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.440]   That's where all the stress is.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.000]   Once the decision is made, it's just simply a matter of step one, step two, step three,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.840]   and then not quitting when things go wrong.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.480]   And making the decision, as long as you give yourself permission to basically screw it
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.920]   all up, it's OK.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.640]   You're going to get through it.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.200]   You're going to learn.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.280]   You can't have that fear hold you back.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.600]   So in some ways, just kind of jumping and holding your nose and going in overcomes the
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:15.840]   fear.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.400]   And then you're in it.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.320]   And then you'll figure it out as you go through.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.200]   That's exactly it.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.120]   I mean, the first step is the hardest, but every step after that gets easier.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.560]   And the fear thing, exactly.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.960]   I mean, one thing I've really learned over the last couple of years is that I make a
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.680]   decision.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.000]   It's most often a subconscious decision, but I make it every morning I wake up.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.360]   I decide, am I going to live in fear and scarcity, or am I going to live in joy and abundance,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   or like sort of fear versus love?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.040]   Which way am I going to go?
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.360]   And when you go the fear and scarcity road, that attracts fear and scarcity.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   It's like misery loves company.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   You dwell on negative things, you'll attract negative things.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   But then you go the other way, and you focus on positive things, eliminate negative thoughts
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.640]   from your mind, at least for the long term.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.280]   Negative thoughts will pop up from time to time, but be aware of them and think positive
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.600]   and be kind, smile to people.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.840]   And it's amazing how your life will change.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.200]   People will smile at you.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.120]   People want to help you if you help them.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:22.560]   And it's just incredible how just your outlook will change most of the things in your life.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.880]   Then your actions will really start to have a snowballing effect.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.000]   And that's what it's been for me.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.760]   It's so cool to be providing for people's basic needs in a community.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.800]   That's what I love about being a farmer, is that when it really comes down to it,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.240]   I'm just growing food for people.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's simple.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.160]   People can relate to it.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.840]   It crosses cultural barriers.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.240]   It crosses socioeconomic barriers.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.040]   I'm a guy who's supplying food in my community.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.960]   And I think we probably talked a little bit about this in the previous show, but we don't
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.760]   have that anymore.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.920]   80 years ago, 25% of the people in the US and Canada were farmers, 25%.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.320]   And we don't have that anymore.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.880]   When my grandfather was a kid, they were a mixed farm.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.320]   And things that they needed, they got from the people around them, for the most part.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.680]   Nowadays, everything's centralized.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:24.080]   It's either I can get pretty much everything I want at Walmart, or it's like if I can't
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.720]   get it, well, then I got a welfare check come in or something like that.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:35.360]   So when a society is completely dependent on the state, nobody really has an incentive
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.880]   to get to know one another.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.520]   And I think there's a calling for that.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.480]   I don't know if most people would articulate it.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.360]   Maybe in your audience, they would, because I actually had a lot of lovely emails from
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:55.120]   people who were more along the anarcho-capitalist or libertarian mindset, which is really nice
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.000]   for me, because I live in a country that is so damn socialist.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.800]   Everything that's talked about solutions is just, oh, the government's going to do
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.640]   this, the government's going to do that.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.800]   But that's the thing that I find is perpetuating this disconnection to one another.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.080]   And I definitely would not be so arrogant to blame that on solely the government.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.840]   I think there's many other factors there.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.400]   But I think people, if not consciously and subconsciously, are yearning for a connection
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.240]   with the people around them.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.680]   And I think agriculture is a great place to start from that, because if you've got
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.560]   a good, strong food system in a community, then that local economy can build from there.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.960]   And then you could just go on to skilled labor.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.560]   And then once you have a system with food and basic needs, then all kinds of other people
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   can participate in it as well.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.520]   And so I think farming is a beautiful vehicle to get those things in motion.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:55.360]   I want to build on that, give you a little intro, but I want to ask how you can control
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.520]   the risk, because I love everything you just said.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.120]   And what's funny about my audience, I've got the coolest audience in the world.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.840]   I get emails from people that say, "Joshua, I'm a liberal Democrat.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.240]   Joshua, I'm an anarcho-capitalist."
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.920]   I got a cool cross-section of people, and I love that, to have a healthy, vigorous debate
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.800]   and discussion, and just simply have the ability to have an adult conversation and part as
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.160]   friends no matter where we wind up.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.960]   Exactly.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.200]   I think I'm building one of the coolest audiences I've ever heard from, and I get
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.840]   to get the emails.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.800]   It's super, super fun.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.440]   So I love everything you just said, and yet there's also a corollary.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.080]   I'm all for jumping in with both feet, but if you're going to jump in with both feet,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.640]   don't start off with a 100-foot high dive.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   Start off with one that's two feet above.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:48.720]   And so what I love is if there's a way where you can minimize the potential risk of failure
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.080]   while maximizing the return.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.600]   I think this can be applied in every business.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.960]   I'm super thrilled.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.320]   Just this last weekend, I think I figured out a way, as I kind of grope about and learn
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.560]   how to build the business side of my show to where it can make a living, I think I've
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:08.320]   found actually a massively potential kind of side business that will be supported by
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.840]   the show that will actually make me some money.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.640]   And the risk, basically I calculate my risk.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.840]   Maximum risk, I'm out anywhere from 500 bucks to 2,000 bucks.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.160]   And maximum upside is hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.600]   That's a risk I'll take every time.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:33.440]   So how can we do that in farming, and how can we figure out a way to minimize the risk
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.360]   and yet maximize the reward?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.960]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.400]   And that's actually one of my-- this is one of my top pieces of advice that I tell
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.520]   people that kind of goes a little outside of the technical side but speaks more to the
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.480]   personal side, is source high-grade information.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.000]   So that means-- I do a lot of consulting for--
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.720]   That means buy your course that you're writing is what that means.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.400]   Oh, it literally does.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.600]   That's awesome.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.560]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   It's a way to just promote my own stuff.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.680]   But the thing is, I suffered for five years on your behalf.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.240]   Right?
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.760]   I've learned the hard way because I felt that I had to rewrite the book, which is a
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.960]   huge mistake.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.520]   I mean, I did learn a lot of things from other farmers.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.040]   But it's like people have suffered on your behalf.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:29.360]   So why would you go and start from point A when you can go-- don't go to university
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:29.920]   for this stuff.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.640]   Don't go get a master's degree in urban agriculture.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.080]   I know there's people that are providing it.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.760]   Don't go waste $20,000.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.640]   I'm talking about spend-- if you spend $1,000 on a little bit of consulting and going to
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.000]   some workshops and doing some online research and reading some books, you will save yourself
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   years of trial and error and thousands of dollars of wasted money.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.320]   And one example is-- I didn't really learn this right away.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.160]   I did in my last couple years.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:03.280]   And I actually would pay people for consulting and actually, hey, I'm willing to bring value
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.560]   to the table for you because I really value your information.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.200]   Things like irrigation.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.760]   I heard from all kinds of different farmers on certain ways to do irrigation.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.320]   I had some bad advice as well.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.200]   Often, I find the advice that's the most free and abundant can be sometimes the worst advice.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.040]   Sometimes it's worth it to find the person who's doing this, pay for the time, and learn
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.080]   it the right way.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.920]   I've got thousands of dollars of irrigation stuff that I don't even use anymore.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.520]   Because if I would have just gone to somebody in the field, an expert, paid for their time,
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.880]   I could have saved all that messing around.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.760]   And I was screwing around for hours a week on irrigation and buying all these things
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.560]   I didn't need.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.800]   So there's things like that.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.520]   And then there's also things on the production side of whether you're-- how to grow certain
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.520]   things or even in the marketing side.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.120]   I mean, the marketing side is huge.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.480]   But it's like if I would have just swallowed my pride a little bit and said, hey, there's
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.920]   got to be a better way to do this.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.320]   Maybe I can have a value exchange with somebody to save that time.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.520]   That's got to be the biggest thing.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.680]   Because I think most people-- it might be a little different from your audience.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:17.920]   The emails that I got from some of your listeners after doing your show was a lot of real practical
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:25.040]   minded people, the kind of people I really identify with, that were like, OK, what's
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.480]   the step A for me?
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.280]   Are they coming from a previous career and want to start something new?
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.600]   And it's just go the path of least resistance.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   Go learn what you can from other people and start from there.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.040]   And then you don't have to suffer.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.000]   I mean, the whole reason I've put together this online course, this Profitable Urban
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.920]   Farming course-- people, if they're interested, can just go to profitableurbanfarming.com
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.440]   and sign up for the newsletter when we release it.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.200]   Is that my goal is sort of-- I don't want to say altruistic.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:06.400]   But I would like to see millions of small farmers across the US and Canada start farming.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.760]   Because I think decentralization is sort of a way that we're going.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.320]   I mean, I look at some of the cool technology today, and it's this trend of decentralization.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:14.800]   It's awesome.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.160]   It is awesome.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   And I think there's going to be some technological solutions for urban farmers.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.440]   I'm working on some myself.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.760]   But I would like to see these millions of small farmers across the US and Canada-- so
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.560]   build this local resilient system.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.720]   And it can start with farmers, and then it can go into other things.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.840]   But everybody needs to eat.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.040]   That's the beauty of it, right?
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.520]   It's simple.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.320]   Everybody needs to eat.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.600]   You can't argue that.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.840]   So there's going to be a need for farmers.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.640]   And California is in this massive drought right now, and they feed-- well, California
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.280]   and Florida, in fact, feed a lot of North America.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.640]   So the California thing can't last forever.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.720]   And so there's going to be a need pretty soon.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.840]   And there already is in demand.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.320]   Right.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.560]   But I'm talking serious need.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.800]   I think there's a demand, and there's not much perceived need right now.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.280]   In my area, I have looked for local sources, and I can't find it.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.640]   And I know-- I just poll my friends, and I know the demand that is there.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.960]   But it's hard to find the supply.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.080]   And so I think it's changing.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.160]   I want to jump on-- it's so funny.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.040]   You and I, we got to actually meet.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.840]   I got to make a point.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.040]   If I can get up to Orlando, I will.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.440]   But you and I, we seem to jump on all these things that are consistent.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.240]   So this weekend, my business idea is-- and I'm not going to give the subject out.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.880]   But I finally figured out, I think, the course that the market is screaming for from me.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.320]   And I was blind to it until Friday.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.760]   And all of a sudden, I figured out.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.200]   And I can't get past them.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.040]   This is what the market is screaming there's a demand for.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.840]   And in order to meet the demand, I need to create a course.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   And so I've been thinking about this, this course idea.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.240]   And I'm thinking, OK, how do I structure it?
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.840]   I am so convinced beyond measure of the benefit of the course I'm going to create
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.080]   that when I think about the dollar amount, the highest dollar amount that I can put on it,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.360]   I cannot conceive of how it could be anything less than a 10 or 20 times or 30 or more rate
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.680]   of return for the person, if they're in the right demographic that I'm going to target,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.520]   with this course that I'm going to create.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:26.240]   And I can't see how it's not-- I mean, just so much more valuable.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.960]   But what's funny is I'm thinking through, OK, how am I going to position it?
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:36.320]   I was thinking about what I need to learn to prepare what I need to do.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.160]   So the first thing I did, once I figured out the idea, I said, oh, OK, I need to go.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.000]   And I need to get some information.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.520]   And so I was researching.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.120]   And I've got three courses, two of which I already have access to,
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.000]   and one of which I probably need to buy, that are all focused
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.040]   on how to launch a successful online course.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.800]   This is the information that I need specifically at this point in time.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.480]   And this information, for me, is so valuable because it solves a need.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.240]   And I was thinking about compare that to how we usually seem to handle life.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.920]   Usually what we do is we say, well, I'm going to go out.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.040]   And I'm going to spend thousands of dollars on a general primary and secondary school education.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.640]   And I'm going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on this general knowledge
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.160]   of this college degree that's not applicable to what I need.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.120]   And that's not how an adult approaches information.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:31.920]   So most of us, I've spent $80,000 on my undergraduate college degree.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.240]   And that was so foolish as far as the payoff of investment versus potential reward.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.280]   But now for me to go and spend $1,000 bucks or $2,000 bucks or whatever I spent on the course
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.840]   for specific knowledge to a specific need, that's intelligent education.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.640]   - Oh, yeah. That's just getting to the goods, right?
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.040]   I mean, just think about all the time, like how many years did I waste in public school?
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.360]   - Right.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:02.000]   - It's like all the garbage that the state shoves down my throat in public school.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.800]   And probably the only things that I use that I learned in public school are basic addition,
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.400]   maybe a little bit of geometry and geography,
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.040]   and maybe some people skills that I learned in school.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   I probably could have learned those in four years.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.560]   You know, I find that stuff ironic because now Obama's talking about,
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.400]   we're going to give two years of education.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.840]   It's like, okay, so it didn't work for the first 12 years because everybody in the US
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.440]   and Canada has these garbage useless degrees and worthlessness.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.880]   And now we're going to give you two years of more free crap that's not going to do anything for you.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.520]   I love the irony of all this stuff, you know.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.280]   But that's it, you know, and that goes back to the source high-grade information stuff.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.640]   Forget the crap, get to the guts of the stuff.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:44.880]   - Right.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.040]   - Give the hard details.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.560]   And that's what I'm all about, man.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.400]   That's what I teach in my workshops is like, I'm going to save all the fluff.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.480]   You know, I talk a little bit of personal stuff because I think that's relevant to
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.600]   people's learning experience.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.200]   But, you know, get to the nitty-gritty, the real goods.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.360]   - Right.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   - And, you know, you go study agriculture in university and you'll get years of theory
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.280]   and all kinds of stuff that is just like where you could just go to a farmer who's in the business
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.080]   and spend a little bit of time with them and get miles ahead of all the people that are wasting
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.640]   $20,000 a year and just get some piece of paper that just becomes wallpaper, you know.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.040]   - Right.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.120]   - Right.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.680]   - And here's what's so cool though, part of the decentralization thing.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:33.120]   I've been thinking about this and here's the opportunity that we have today in 2015 that
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.000]   did not exist in 2000, well, did not exist in 1995.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:48.240]   The major, so if people can go, there is never a downside to buying specific expertise applied
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.960]   to a specific situation if you can have trust and confidence in the source.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.840]   But if you can't have trust and confidence in the source, then there is tremendous risk
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.720]   of, oh, maybe the source is not good.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:07.840]   And this is the problem that has existed in buying transactions throughout much of human
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.440]   history is how do you know the source on a mass market basis?
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.120]   But today, when you can find the world's expert and that world's expert can establish their
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.720]   credentials, not necessarily with some external credential granting institution, although that's
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:28.320]   fine, but actually can establish it with free and open information to establish who they are.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.360]   Like anybody who listens to my show knows who I am.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.320]   Anybody who's listened to three or four of your interviews is going to know who you are.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.360]   And now, then you can trust a person.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:48.480]   And so we've lowered that disconnect, that fear of counterparty trust out of transactions,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.760]   financial trades.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.800]   So now, if I know who you are and if I'm interested in starting an urban farm, I can come to you,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.960]   I can feel confident that you know what you're doing.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.160]   I can spend enough time with your material, with your content, with your talks.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.120]   I can go on YouTube.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:07.680]   I can find your talks at what's Diego Garcia's Permaculture Voices.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.080]   I can go and hear you on 10 different interviews.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.360]   I can hear you develop over time.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.720]   I can read your stuff.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.400]   I can be confident that you are who you say you are and that you're the person I need.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.000]   And if that's the right fit, boom, whatever.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.840]   I don't know what you're going to charge for your course, but it's worth it because I've
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.720]   solved that.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.880]   It's a low risk transaction at that point.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.840]   - Exactly.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.520]   We've taken out the middleman, right?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.880]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:35.040]   - Through a university to learn something, you can go on my YouTube channel and I'll
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.720]   show you stuff that I'm doing in the field and you can see that I know what I'm talking
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.360]   about.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.720]   And that's the beauty of it.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.440]   I mean, there's all kinds of cool, there's a great tech app that's actually come out
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.080]   of Kelowna, my hometown here.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:56.000]   It's a website called Soilmate.com and it's basically a way of connecting anybody in a
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.040]   local geographical area to farmers who grow their stuff.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.400]   So you go on this website, you can search, I'm looking for beets.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.800]   Who in my, this zone that I pick has beets and it'll list these farmers.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.280]   You can prepay the transactions there and then you just go and pick it up from the farmer.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:18.080]   It's stuff like this that is more decentralized software applications.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.760]   I love, I'm a huge tech fan.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.640]   - What's that called?
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.200]   - It's called Soilmate.com.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.080]   - Okay, cool.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.640]   - And I think it'll be big.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.760]   I think they're onto something that is yet to really take off yet but the concept is
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.840]   there because it removes a lot of the barriers.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.920]   Like even sometimes picking up at the farmer's market isn't always convenient for people.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.480]   You know, they don't wanna, maybe they're a little bit more adverse to the crowds and
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.120]   they don't wanna go and park or all these.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.320]   But you now connect directly to the farmer and find farmers in your local area anywhere.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.200]   So I mean, yeah, farmers should go and sign up on that too because there's the potential
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:55.360]   of it.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:55.840]   It's huge.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.040]   And that's not the only one.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.800]   There's all kinds of other ones.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.600]   This guy I met in New Zealand started this one called Ubi, like four O's, B-Y.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.040]   It's like out of our own backyards.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:11.200]   It's another software solution to connect people to food producers in their area.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   Like the potential of this is great.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.680]   I mean, but at the same time, I don't think the grocery store in that whole system is
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.640]   gonna go away overnight.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.200]   - Definitely not.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.640]   - But it's cool to know, and I mean, I shop at the grocery store too, right?
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.560]   Like I'm not completely self-sufficient.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.800]   But it's cool to know that we're transitioning now.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.960]   And so I think like right now, there's never been a better time to get into agriculture.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.440]   - Sure.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.080]   - Just looking at, you know, I don't know about you, Josh, but I believe personally,
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.280]   everything is supply and demand.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:48.160]   Whether it's relationships, information, or money, or skills, whatever it is, everything's
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.960]   supply and demand.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:55.440]   And if you look at the supply and demand of farmers right now, that says a lot.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.400]   We have gone, in the last 80 years, we have gone from having 25% of our population directly
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.920]   involved in agriculture to 2%.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.200]   And now we see a massive interest in nutritional, wholesome, local food.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.880]   And people wanna know their farmers because they don't trust what the labels tell them.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.000]   You know, issues of genetically modified stuff.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.480]   We've got all the kinds of adverse health and environmental effects that the industrial
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.160]   food system has caused.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.560]   People are saying, "Hey, I don't want that garbage.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   I wanna know who grows my food."
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.640]   And so this is a trend that's going to continue no matter what happens in the economy.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.400]   In fact, I think if the economy gets worse, it'll probably grow faster.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:43.440]   So, you know, to get into farming right now is kind of like--I personally, and just even
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.560]   in my own personal experience, I see it sort of like the dot-com thing where it's like,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.720]   "Hey, this internet thing is starting to happen.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.160]   Okay, let's do it."
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:58.880]   I think millionaires will be made in farming in the next 10 or so years because there's
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.320]   going to be a massive need.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.160]   I mean, farmers are aging, right?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.800]   The average age of a farmer in North America is around 60 years old, and there's not enough
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.480]   people moving in to fill those jobs.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:14.640]   So, you know, we talk about the economics, whether it's inflation, and rising food prices
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.080]   because of rising energy prices.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   Right now, this is just a little anomaly, I think.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.440]   I mean, it can't last as far as energy prices.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.120]   Food prices will continue to go up.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.400]   They have been for, like, steadily since I was a child.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.440]   That's not gonna change.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.760]   But the real fact of the matter is that there's just not enough farmers.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.240]   And so, if more people aren't going in to fill those shoes of those farmers, you won't
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.920]   have any food at any price.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.200]   Right.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.880]   So, you know, the time is now.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.640]   It's interesting.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:49.120]   This last couple weeks, I've been personally researching a few things and trying to figure
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.400]   out if there's any way that I can actually start a personal experiment of exclusively
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.280]   isolating the GMO food variable in my diet.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.360]   And I'm overweight, and I've been overweight for a long time, and it doesn't make sense
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:10.320]   to me why I'm as overweight as I am with regard to knowing what I know about nutrition, physical
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.640]   activity, recognizing how much I eat.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.560]   Like, it's never made sense to me.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.480]   And so, I've had some experience with some family members who finally kind of figured
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.280]   out some external factors about basically toxins and the impact of toxins on their body.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.760]   And I've been trying to figure out, one of my projects for 2015 is to try to figure out,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.440]   like, do I just lack discipline?
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.440]   You know, that's what I always have told myself for years.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.720]   Well, Joshua, there's something wrong with you.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.760]   You lack discipline.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.440]   Or is there something going on?
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.680]   Because I shouldn't be as fat as I am.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.040]   I really don't think I should be.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.480]   So, I was reading some discussion and listening to the guy who wrote, what's the documentary?
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.080]   I haven't watched it yet, but I was listening to a talk by the guy who gave the documentary
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.920]   Genetic Roulette, I think.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.200]   And he was presenting information and-
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.320]   Michael Pollan?
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.360]   No, it wasn't Michael Pollan.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.120]   I know Michael Pollan.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.000]   I've read some of his work.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.440]   I'll find it in a second.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.840]   I'll Google it once we switch the conversation back to you.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.240]   But I'll duck, duck, go.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:10.640]   Excuse me.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.520]   I don't Google anymore.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.480]   So, I was reading about it.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:20.160]   I was wondering, like, huh, I wonder, could some of my health issues be a result of GMOs?
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.280]   But the problem is to isolate that variable.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   Because a lot of times, if you go to GMO-free, then you go to organic.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.600]   Or if you go to- I mean, there are other things.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.960]   And organic, I'm not trying to isolate necessarily organic, inorganic.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.560]   Although I prefer to eat organic.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.280]   I'm interested in isolating that GMO variable.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.640]   And so, I've been researching, is there any way that I could do it?
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:48.240]   It's tough, if not impossible, for me to do, because the supply doesn't exist locally.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.640]   And so, I would do it if I could.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   And I might still be able to.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.520]   I'm still trying to figure out if there's a way I can do it.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.520]   But it's a very difficult problem to face.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.720]   And what I've learned is that there are other people who have exactly the same problem.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   And I can't even run the experiment, because the supply is not there.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.560]   - Right, right.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.200]   But that tells you that the demand is there, then, right?
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.360]   There's a huge market opportunity in all this for anybody who-
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.520]   You know, the cool thing about our roots as North Americans, we're pioneers.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.280]   We are, in our blood, most of us have farmers in there.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.320]   So, I don't think any of this is anything new.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:34.000]   And I don't think it's anything that anybody wouldn't be capable of themselves.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.600]   But, I mean, as far as the GMOs, I totally agree with you.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.280]   When you go to a whole food diet, and I'm by no means a nutritional expert,
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.920]   but I've got a pretty damn good quality of life.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.760]   I mean, I go, even in the winter here, two feet on the snow,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.840]   I go up my greenhouse and pick fresh kale and spinach and juice it in the morning,
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.800]   and make myself smoothies with frozen berries and things that I get from other farmers around me.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.520]   I mean, it's a pretty cool quality of life.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:05.120]   But, you know, I also eat a lot of good bacon and stuff.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.920]   I eat stuff that's fatty as well, but I eat good quality.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.680]   I know the farmers that I get my stuff from.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.440]   And man, I have bacon every…
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.160]   I've got like sort of the hippie redneck breakfast going on,
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.160]   where I have like a green smoothie with kale and spinach with bacon in the morning.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.320]   But, it's all about the quality.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:22.880]   - I'm with you.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.480]   I can't… I don't know.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.120]   Here I am.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.280]   I can't find…
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.080]   I love bacon, and I can't find a decent source.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:36.640]   And when you understand, as I think is true, you know,
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.200]   toxins are generally locked up in fat.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.520]   And you think, I don't have any problem with the fat,
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.040]   but I don't want the Johnson and whatever, the Johnsonville or whatever.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.240]   I don't want that pig that has just stood there and hasn't been able to move for six months.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.360]   Anyway, we'll get off of this.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.720]   I wanted to come back to one thing on the course,
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.120]   and I want to continue with some practical education for people who are interested.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.640]   But one other thing on the course.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   I used to think that the primary benefit that somebody could bring was information.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.400]   And I realized that I learned this, and I don't think I fully grasped it until recently,
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.240]   is I thought that as a financial planner,
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.120]   that what I was doing was bringing information to bear.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.000]   And I've since learned that information is free.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.240]   All the information that somebody needs about urban farming,
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.680]   everything you know, already exists out there.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.800]   Because somebody else is…
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.120]   You got it from somebody else who synthesized something,
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.360]   and there may be one idea that you actually discovered on your own,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.840]   but it was with the application of two ideas that someone else had.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.440]   So if you spend enough time on YouTube, or if you spend enough time reading,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.520]   whether it's current urban farming things,
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.200]   or go back to 1638 and read about what they said to do then,
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.680]   the information is out there.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.800]   But the problem is we're drowning in information, and we're bereft of wisdom.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.320]   And what we get paid for, and what is so valuable,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.600]   is when I finally figured out what I get paid for as a financial planner,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.720]   is the application of broad-ranging knowledge to a specific situation.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.040]   And that is worth big money, because it saves time.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.200]   And as information multiplies and multiplies and multiplies and multiplies,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.720]   we don't need information.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.880]   We need application of wisdom to a scenario.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.440]   I think of, you mentioned earlier, Tim Ferriss' podcast.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.760]   I listened to an interview he did with Kevin Kelly.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.320]   And I didn't really know anything about Kevin Kelly.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.960]   And I was just fascinated by this interview he did though,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.000]   because he made the statement.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.080]   He said, "I predict that in the future, books will be free,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.400]   and what we will pay Amazon for is not the book,
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.000]   is for the suggestion of the next book to read."
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.080]   Because that's what's overwhelming.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.040]   And it blew my mind.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.800]   And since then, I haven't gotten away from it.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.920]   That's what we need, is we need the application of expert information
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.520]   in a specific situation.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.600]   And that's what experts bring to the table.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.040]   Well, and that's just it, because going on what you said there too,
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.520]   is that, yes, you're right, all the information is free.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.240]   It's all there.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.520]   But how much time do you have?
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.000]   And the more information, we are in an information age,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.920]   where information is in an abundance, but expertise is in scarcity.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:14.160]   So what can I do to save time to sift through all the crap?
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.920]   Spend a thousand bucks.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.680]   And go straight to the heart of the matter, get what I need,
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.160]   and get in production and get on with my life,
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.120]   instead of sitting in a classroom for a year or two or three or four.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.680]   Get to it and start your life today.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.120]   I mean, it's interesting, because when I started,
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.560]   I was at sort of, I had a few different things I wanted to do
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.160]   to learn how to do this.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.000]   And one of the things that I was really looking at,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.760]   was going to this farming school.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.120]   And it's a cool program.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.680]   It's out here on the west coast of BC.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.920]   And cool program.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.320]   But really, when I looked at what I had to do,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.080]   is I had to go into this program for a year.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.920]   It's going to cost me about $20,000, a little bit more with living expenses.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.680]   And when I came out of it, I would have to,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.640]   if ultimately I wanted to do is be a farmer,
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.720]   well, then I'd have to raise the capital to start the farm.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.880]   Basically, I said, you know what, I did this bike tour down the west coast.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.960]   I don't know if I mentioned this to you in the last show,
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.240]   but a real big turning point in my life was,
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.440]   I rode my bike from Kelowna to Tijuana, basically.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.400]   I went down the west coast.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.600]   I visited, not urban farms, but eco villages and homesteads,
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.800]   and all kinds of things like this.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.200]   Got really inspired about what people were doing.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.960]   More or less, got inspired about myself,
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.480]   because I realized that when I wear my values on my sleeve,
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.920]   this is who I am, take me or leave me,
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.480]   I'm not afraid to show some vulnerability in my imperfections.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.200]   People really gravitated towards that.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.880]   But I also felt like I could do anything.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.080]   And so that's where I was like,
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.680]   I started to think about going to take this course.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.280]   And I said, you know what, why don't I just go all out, take the risk,
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.600]   take that money I would have spent at that school,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.960]   and just put it into my own business.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.040]   And even if worst case scenario, it failed,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.080]   well, at least I'd have a hell of a lot better idea how to do it the next year.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.440]   Or if I didn't even want to do it,
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.680]   it would have been the same as spending the money in the school.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.480]   But I was willing to take that risk in the sense that if I do okay,
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.600]   then I can do it again the next year and maybe make some more money at it.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.720]   And so that was a far better thing to do, is to just, let's go for it.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.120]   - Right.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.440]   That resonates with me, because same thing.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.600]   I mean, I try very hard not to regret the past.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.000]   We all are, in many ways, our lives simply reflect a series of decisions we've made,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.080]   and you can't go back and predict anything.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.200]   But I've had the same thought.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.960]   Man, if I would have taken that 80 grand that I spent on college,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.160]   and I would have just simply said,
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.280]   I am going to blow every last dime of this.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.680]   I'm going to blow 10,000 bucks on books, and I'm going to read them.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:47.200]   And I'm going to blow 70,000 bucks on just wasted business things.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.120]   I don't think there's any possibility that I could finish blowing the $70,000
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.000]   without having a few million dollars in the bank.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.720]   If you give yourself the permission to fail,
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.800]   and you give yourself a little bit of capital,
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.320]   not even necessarily a lot, but a little bit.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.680]   Let's say I put myself on a budget.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.000]   I'm going to waste $20,000 a year over the next four years
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.440]   until I get a business that works.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.560]   A, I'd either have a business that went,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.400]   or I would have 80,000 bucks worth of hard lessons learned,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.760]   and I would be on the cusp of the business that was going to work.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.520]   A lot different than having the diploma.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.040]   - Well, and that's the thing too, is that, like you said,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.200]   give yourself the permission to fail, but then take that and fail better.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.680]   Learn from your failures and channel those.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:39.520]   Because if you don't learn from your failures, then you're wasting time.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:39.840]   - Right.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.760]   - So failures, that's good.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.240]   That's good.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.840]   And again, it goes back into this choosing fear or love in your day-to-day life.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.520]   And when you choose love, you look at things positively.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.120]   And so every time I screw something up, I go, "Hey, there's an opportunity."
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.560]   And the cool thing about it too is, I mean, I'm of the thinking,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.280]   and I'm sure you can relate to this, and probably a lot of your listeners too,
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   is that when you really boil everything down,
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.680]   everything just comes back to human relationships.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.200]   That's really all that's important.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.760]   I could lose everything in the stock market.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.640]   I could have my house burned to the ground.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.080]   People could steal all my crops.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.800]   But at the end of the day, all that matters is the relationships
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.840]   that I've built in my life.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:25.200]   And so this comes back into failing, is that in the sense,
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.440]   sometimes we fail with each other.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.920]   Sometimes a customer of mine might complain about something, right?
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:37.600]   And so every time there's a failure, there's an opportunity to turn a negative into a positive
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.160]   by saying, "Okay, this person has given me an opportunity to make it right."
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.120]   And so this is something my dad really hammered into my head.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.200]   My dad is a real, like a small businessman,
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.880]   did many different entrepreneurial things in his life.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.360]   But he always said, "You don't just make it right, you make it better."
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.320]   So there's an opportunity.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.520]   So for example, somebody would come to my farmer's market stand and say,
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.320]   "Oh, I bought a bag of salad mix from you last week,
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.240]   and it's spoiled by the time I go home."
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.400]   So it's like right there is an opportunity.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.080]   So what does a bag of salad mix really cost me in the day?
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.280]   So to give them another one, it doesn't cost me anything.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:19.040]   But to make it better now turns this situation that started off negative into something better.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.640]   So, okay, here's a bag of salad mix.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.400]   Here's a few other things as well.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.320]   And then they leave with a smile on their face saying, "Wow, I wasn't expecting that."
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.480]   Because most people, when people take criticism,
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.760]   the most of the time that just a guard goes up in front of them,
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   and they say, "Oh, that's defensive.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.200]   Oh, what? No, what are you talking about?
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:37.920]   I never have this."
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.320]   And this sort of pride mechanism kicks in.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.400]   But it's like, "Hey, humble yourself."
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:48.000]   You know, here's an opportunity for now to make this person make their day better.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.640]   And you know what?
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.480]   In the end, they're probably going to come back the next week and bring their friends.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:52.720]   Right.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.760]   So that's what I mean by taking an opportunity that was bad,
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.320]   not just making it right, but making it better.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.120]   That's how we can make-- with our failures,
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.520]   we can always fail better and improve ourselves through that process.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.760]   And you really only do that through experience.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.800]   You don't really get that when you go to university for something, right?
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.320]   I mean, let's face it, too.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.560]   I mean, we're-- like we said earlier, we're in an-- information is in abundance.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.520]   And like universities, since they've been subsidized by the government, have gone rampant.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.360]   I mean, everybody's got a degree now, right?
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.320]   I mean, people working as a bouncer at a bar probably have a degree in like social science
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:30.640]   or something.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.840]   You know, who knows?
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.360]   But everybody's got a degree.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.640]   So it all goes back to the supply and demand thing.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.840]   If everybody has the same stuff, its value goes down.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:46.720]   And so a degree today, eh, I'd say you're better off putting your money into a business
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:51.760]   and starting to make something happen, get into production, provide-- it's so simple
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.320]   in business, right?
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.680]   Provide stuff that people need.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:53.920]   - Right.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.240]   - Right?
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.280]   - And keep a habit.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.440]   - Yeah, that's really all it is.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.880]   And it can be so fun along the way, too, because when you go into that love-based mindset,
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.360]   I mean, every day is fun.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.960]   Human relationships are incredible.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.520]   I mean, I love-- even just with farming.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.640]   I mean, I love going on the road, coming to places like Florida and meeting awesome people,
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.120]   too.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   But I mean, just with farming, I mean, you get to talk to great people all day.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.760]   People who shop at farmers markets want to talk to the farmer.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.440]   I mean, it's a dream, man.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:21.840]   - Right.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.760]   I want to share one concept.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.720]   I love everything you said.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.360]   And it just shocks me when big businesses don't seem to recognize, if I just keep a
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:34.000]   customer, it's like their entire goal is to tick off their customer sometimes.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.880]   And little businesses know that.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:42.400]   Hey, what if-- here, it was spoiled here, three bags of salad mix and a bunch of other
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.360]   stuff with it.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.640]   And it's so cheap compared to future customers.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   But I want to go back to something you said on failure.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.680]   And this is turning into swap business stories, I guess, instead of how to start an urban
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.000]   farm.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.040]   But you and I, we seem to have a synergy of some kind.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:04.800]   One concept I thought that just-- excuse me, one concept I learned that has completely
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:12.000]   transformed my willingness to fail is to stop thinking in terms of success or failure and
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.520]   to think in terms of feedback.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:20.720]   And what I realized, I believe if I were to cite the source, I believe this was part of--
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.640]   years ago, I thought I wanted to become a copywriter and write advertising literature.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.200]   And it seemed to be kind of an ideal business for me.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.400]   I was OK at writing.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.800]   I figured I could do it from anywhere in the world.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.160]   I could make a lot of money.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.120]   So I pursued it.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:35.920]   I bought a course.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.640]   And I was working my way through this copywriting course.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.120]   And I think they were talking about the failure rates.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:46.160]   And the thing about copywriting, when you're writing, let's say, a traditional direct mail,
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.960]   an advertisement in the mail-- now you see it online.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.200]   But there's still plenty in the mail.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.880]   Because you're always just testing.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.080]   And you're always testing.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.360]   And you send out one letter.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.880]   And you see what the response is.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.240]   And then you send out another letter.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.960]   And you see if the response is better or worse.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.080]   And you're just getting feedback.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.520]   And if the response is better, then that letter becomes your standard.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.360]   And that's the one that everything's measured against.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.840]   And you're always, always testing, testing new things, trying this, trying that, trying
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.880]   this, trying that.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.080]   And a copywriter, a salesperson, never thinks in terms of success or failure.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.240]   They just think in terms of feedback.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.600]   Wow, this one flopped.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.440]   This one had a bad response rate.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.120]   We'll trash that and go on to the next thing.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.400]   It's no big deal.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.320]   So they test in small batches.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.440]   And then they continue on.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:35.760]   And they don't worry about and assign this whole emotional weight to, oh, this letter
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.800]   just failed.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.080]   I am a terrible person.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.000]   My business is a disaster.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.800]   I should just quit.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.600]   I hate my life.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.760]   No, that letter didn't work.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.320]   Feedback.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.840]   Marketplace gave us feedback.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.400]   Move on.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.160]   And that's what capitalism is supposed to be.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.400]   Money is just a form of feedback.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.880]   But what happens is we often assign this great emotional weight to certain things.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.120]   And we say, oh, if I do this, and this business doesn't work, it's going to fail.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.200]   Ignore failure.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.320]   It's just feedback.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.840]   Market says this isn't valued.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.440]   Market says this is valued.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:10.080]   And if we disconnect this emotional weight and just listen to what the market is saying--
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.600]   Exactly.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.560]   And that's the cool thing about-- I always look at these correlations.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:21.280]   And I love the correlation between-- I consider myself like a true free market capitalist
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.320]   in the traditional sense.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.800]   I don't believe what is represented in the US or Canada or most of the world today is
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.480]   what true free market capitalism is.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.120]   But there still is a little bit of it left.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:36.080]   And I love the correlation to what you're saying to the feedback that exists with your
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.680]   customers or products or whatever.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.480]   I like to-- I'll pull that back from being a farmer and say, you know, there's also this
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.960]   feedback loop in nature that is so cool.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.360]   And when you're a farmer, you see it right away.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:52.480]   And I think being a farmer has made me so much of a better person because of being aware
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.600]   of these feedback loops.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.200]   For example, things you do when you're growing plants, there's this pretty immediate feedback
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.320]   loop that if you're doing something that doesn't work, you notice it.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.160]   You can notice it the next day with the health of your plants or your crops.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   And we've become so-- everything that comes to us through the power of the state, through
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.720]   the barrel of a gun, comes in one way.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.400]   It's one way direction.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.840]   There is no feedback loop.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.680]   If the government-- if something doesn't work for a government program, there's no feedback
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.000]   loop.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.560]   They just pump more money into it, right?
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.000]   There's no feedback loop.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.480]   And that's the thing is that when we really assess ourselves as human beings, as like
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:40.320]   emotional human beings that care for one another, these feedback loops exist in the free market,
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.280]   in the real free market.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.480]   It exists a little bit today, but all these things exist in nature.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.200]   They exist in economics across the board.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.040]   These feedback loops exist.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.880]   And if we don't pay attention to them, that's when things go wrong.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.720]   And this is like for me-- I open a can of worms at this, but this is like the ultimate
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:02.800]   failure of the state, the ultimate failure of the American dream originally, or what
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.520]   the forefathers wanted was an incredible thing.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.840]   But we've gone so far from that.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.960]   And these feedback loops just don't exist.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:20.400]   But if you are aware of the feedback and you start a business or you start a farm or no
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:24.800]   matter what your mission is in life, if you become aware of these feedback loops in everything
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:31.520]   that you do, you can make tremendous strides in your personal and business life, like very
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:31.920]   easily.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.920]   But it's just opening your ears and eyes.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.600]   And I love how you talked about it.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.640]   It's just like forget about whether it's failure or not, because if you say failure, then there's
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.440]   sort of this sense to feel sort of defeated or feel like you made a mistake.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.840]   But it's just like that's just a market response.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:54.000]   And the beauty of a real free market is that a free market exists in everything, not just
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.880]   economics.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.960]   There's a free market-- we are voluntarily discussing ideas here.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.440]   This is a free market of ideas, too, right?
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.280]   And as soon as we say, let's stop the free market, well, that's when I started to get
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.000]   a little freaked out.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.320]   But I just try to live my life the best I can and lead by example instead of trying
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.840]   to force people into the way I want to see the world.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.920]   I'm with you.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.320]   So I want to ask you one question.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.880]   And so I thought when we started, we were going to talk about how to get into farming.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.120]   And we've done very little of that.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.760]   Yeah, we've done that.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.560]   But it's been good.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.040]   You said you are in the future going to be running a course and you're coming out with
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.400]   a book in the future.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:42.160]   OK, let's do another interview another time when you're closer to that.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.640]   And let's actually go through that how to get started in farming.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.720]   And you can give some snippets away.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.360]   And that'll help you publicize whenever you-- let me know after the interview, whenever
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:53.840]   that's coming out.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.600]   And that'll help you publicize your course.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.200]   But I want to ask you a question now before we wrap up.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.880]   I want to ask about investment.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.480]   And here's the question.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   I've had a number of people contact me.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:12.560]   And they're interested in investing in things like you describe-- local economy, sustainable
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.600]   agriculture.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.160]   They're interested in supporting ideas like you have.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.840]   And frankly, this is probably where I am.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.200]   I would love-- I'm working hard on some business pursuits.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.880]   And although one of my backup plans is to start an urban farm in my backyard and the
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.760]   backyard of all the neighbors, that's one of my backup plans.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.800]   But right now, I don't think it's-- it's not my primary plan.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.600]   But I still really would love to invest in it.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.560]   I'd love to invest.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.800]   And I'd love to own or be a partner in a local free-range cattle operation.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.840]   We've got one of the most amazing places in the world for beef production is here in Florida.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.600]   And I just drive through central Florida.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.560]   And I think, look at the squandered opportunities here.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.800]   And obviously, there are-- anyway, how could I as an investor, how could an audience, listener
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.200]   as an investor who has a similar philosophical bent to what you're describing, how could
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:12.000]   they actually invest their money profitably into an organization, operation like yours
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.080]   or with similar ethics?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:14.580]   Yeah, OK.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:20.080]   Well, first of all, I'm in no way an investment advisor.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.320]   I don't want to tell people what to do with their money and then have something go wrong.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.080]   And then they say, hey, that was a bad investment.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.320]   So I'm not the best in that regard.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:35.760]   But I've got some ideas on some things that I think in time in the future will prove lucrative
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.440]   for people in a couple ways.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.560]   And so I don't-- it's interesting.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.440]   Your show is about finance for the most part.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.680]   And I definitely agree with you on most things regarding finance.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.360]   But I like to think about investment in a more holistic way.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:58.320]   I like to think about the sort of the triple bottom line return that you can get on investment.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.880]   And what I mean by triple bottom line is the economic, the social, and the environmental
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.760]   benefit.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:09.520]   And I think this is where new capitalism or new free marketism will go, because it just
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.160]   makes sense.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.720]   So there's some cool things.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.920]   I met a young rancher in rural Alberta.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.120]   I was teaching a workshop there.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.160]   And he had a really cool way of getting investment for his farm.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:30.560]   And so when you're starting a ranch, a pasture-raised pork or cattle, there's some capital you need
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:30.880]   up front.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.440]   I mean, in my business system, you can start an annual vegetable urban farm on $5,000 to
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.240]   $10,000 and turn that into $50,000 your first year if you follow my steps.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.280]   But for cattle ranching and things like that, it's a bit more.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.360]   And so this young man had a really cool system where he got people.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.960]   He found, I think it was five investors to put in $5,000.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.160]   And they basically made a bond.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.560]   And so the legalities of this, I'm not exactly sure.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.080]   It might fall into some gray area.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.520]   But what they did was they got everybody to put in $5,000.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.160]   And then he took that money.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:11.200]   And for three years, he gave them a 5% return on that investment, paid in a dividend, either
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.520]   in the form of cash or product.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.840]   And then at the end of the three years, he gave them their money back.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:22.320]   So in a world where governments print money and we live in a low interest rate world,
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.920]   5% return, yeah, sure, it's not a lot on investment if you only think about the financial
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.640]   return.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.360]   But if you think about the social and environmental returns, they're of a way higher magnitude.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.680]   And this is why investing in your local area is so important.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:44.240]   Because not only do you benefit from this young man starting a ranching operation that's
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.760]   going to feed you and your family, potentially for generations, but you are also improving
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.120]   soil, top soil.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.640]   That's a resource capital, right?
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.000]   That's an investment in resource.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.200]   And you invest in a young man or woman who is going to start farming and then teach other
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.000]   people to farm.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.560]   And then there's a social ripple effect there, too.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:11.040]   So I think as far as investment, I don't have a silver bullet to say, hey, this is
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.560]   going to make you millions of dollars.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.040]   But what I will say is you might make a few bucks from it, but look at the other things
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.000]   that you benefit from and how they affect your community.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.880]   Because really, it all comes down to relationships, right?
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.360]   And without that, you can lose all your money in the stock market.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.880]   And if the mood of Europe or America is bad one day, you can lose everything.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:36.000]   But when you really talk about the real forms of capital that are most important, that's
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.400]   what it is.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.560]   And so I think investing in young farmers, so because they're the future, right?
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.480]   There's an aging farming population right now, but there's a new group of farmers that
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.400]   are looking at more holistic ways to do it.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.240]   And I think that's important.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.480]   But I think there are ways that people who have some money could come together, start
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.160]   maybe in some kind of investment fund that invests in young farmers and puts money into
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:58.800]   infrastructure.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.960]   And you have to be a little careful with these things, because I've seen some negative
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:11.280]   effects where people offer too much money available to farmers, and it might attract
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.120]   people that aren't necessarily maybe the best farmers.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.120]   Because it's all the easy come, easy go, right?
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:23.120]   Like, I think it's important that people work hard for those kind of things.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.320]   And I don't see any problem in charging some interest either, because I think if it's
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   too easy come, it's too easy go.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.640]   So have some interest in there, but it's got to be realistic.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.720]   So here would be a question.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.000]   This is actually a selfish question.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:49.520]   I had some correspondence with a listener, and this listener was interested in sustainable
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.280]   agriculture, was interested in building the local economy.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:59.200]   And the listener had enough money to where they were able to fund everything in life
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.080]   that they needed.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.120]   And there are some kind of stages of wealth.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.040]   And one of those stages of wealth, I think, is you have enough financial capital, or at
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.360]   least enough assets that are going to support anything that you can possibly personally
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:11.840]   consume.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:20.480]   And if you reach that point in time, then you start thinking less, and maybe you want
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.960]   to set aside some consumption for your kids, maybe, or other people that are close to you.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.320]   But once you reach that point, there's a limit to what you can consume.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.840]   And then you start looking at advancing your agenda for how you think the world should
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:31.920]   be.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.360]   And this is what the wealthy do.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:39.200]   So you see it primarily, I mean, probably the clearest example is if I've got $3 billion,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.480]   then there's not a chance in the world that, A, any of my kids are going to spend $3 billion.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.960]   And there's not a chance that I'm going to let the government spend my $3 billion.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.360]   So I'm going to give a couple hundred million to the kids, and I'm going to put the rest
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.280]   of it into my nonprofit foundation.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:00.480]   And that allows me to change society from beyond the grave and never pay taxes on it.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.760]   That's the whole point of many so-called philanthropic nonprofit organizations, is to
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.520]   change society over time.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:14.480]   And it allows wealthy people to extend past money into power, which is ultimately one
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.480]   of the things that money is often tied to.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.080]   So I recommended to this listener, I said, listen, if you've got things stabilized, then
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:20.880]   just go invest.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.000]   Do what the rich people do.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.680]   Maybe you don't have a billion dollars to set up the Carnegie Corporation or the Rockefeller
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.720]   Corporation or the Gates Foundation that should change the world and make it into my image,
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.920]   how I think it should be.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.560]   But at least deploy a few million bucks into what you care about.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.760]   So if you had a few million bucks sitting aside, for round numbers, let's say five.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.440]   And let's say I've got five million bucks tucked aside, and I really care about supporting
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.760]   some of the issues that Curtis Stone is into.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.040]   Then how would you deploy that today in 2015?
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.960]   What ideas would you have for that listener?
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.460]   >> Hmm.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.480]   >> Didn't expect that one, did you?
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:09.200]   >> No, but I think there's going to be -- the key is, is we need to have more farmers because
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.560]   we need to have more teachers.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.840]   And the more young farmers we have out there doing stuff and having successes, the more
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.840]   opportunities there will be to pass on those successes and learn from their experience.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.640]   I see huge potential in setting up agricultural schools in a practical sense.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.360]   I mean, one of your friends I've talked to about coming down to West Palm Beach and doing
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.760]   something like this, setting up a hub where we can bring in new farmers, put them through
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.040]   a couple-month program, get them the things they need, and get them out in the field and
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:41.760]   starting those.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.160]   I see potential there.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.240]   >> Would you follow the permaculture model, basically an internship?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.400]   For example, one of the farms I liked -- because they have beautiful photography -- I look
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.720]   at Milkwood Farm in Australia.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.440]   I just watch what they're doing on their farm, and they seem to be having a real impact there
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.080]   in their area.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.040]   They bring people in, they run their market garden for them.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.160]   Would you pursue that type of approach, or how would you design it?
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:08.880]   >> Well, a little bit.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.520]   But I've done that a little bit in the past.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:18.560]   To be honest with you, I find that if the perceived value is too low, it actually affects
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.160]   the quality of education you get.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.160]   In the past, I've actually taken interns -- because I get people that email me from literally
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.080]   all over the world -- that say, "Hey, I want to come down and work on your farm for a week
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.960]   if you teach me stuff."
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:37.840]   The perceived value is that, "Hey, they can get a free education if they come to my farm,
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.240]   and then they'll walk away with all this stuff."
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.040]   But the problem is, if I have to take time away from my production to teach you something,
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.240]   it's hard to do it in a week.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.280]   You need to have time.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:55.600]   So I actually think that there's better potential in paid apprenticeships, where people come
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.000]   and pay to be part of a program.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.840]   That money commitment on their end not only helps the farmer so he can take time away
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.160]   from his operation to teach them, but it also shows level of commitment.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.680]   I often see this in the permaculture community, is there's a lot of idealism, a lot of videos
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.480]   out there.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.920]   There's a lot of great stuff in that community.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.360]   I definitely wouldn't say anything bad about it.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.560]   There's a lot of stuff that's like these big promises.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:31.280]   A lot of it's just based on a lot of altruism, opposed to practicality of, "Okay, altruism's
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.560]   great, but you've got to feed yourself first, and you've got to make sure you build resilience
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.280]   in your own personal life and business life before you can start getting other people
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.240]   to do the same thing."
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:49.600]   So I see more potential in a paid internship, where people pay the farmer, come on the farm
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.960]   for two months, and maybe even they get the money back at the end.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.400]   You put in $2,000, and if you stick around the entire season, you'll get that $2,000
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.120]   after.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.200]   But it shows a level of commitment, because a lot of people romanticize farming.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.720]   They watch a guy like Jeff Lawton, who I'm a huge fan of, but they'll watch his videos
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.400]   and say, "Oh, I want to green the desert.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.680]   I want to do all these things."
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:21.280]   And then they come on my farm, and they realize that reality is pretty far removed from ideology.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.000]   So farming isn't all that glamorous, really.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.480]   Sure, I make it look glamorous when I tell everybody how great it is, and it is great.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.880]   But there's a lot of other work that just needs to get done.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.040]   A lot of sore backs some days, right?
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:35.760]   Yeah, totally.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.120]   What I try to do in my systems is make things streamlined and as efficient as possible,
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.960]   so we avoid those kinds of problems.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:49.360]   But the reality sometimes isn't all that.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:59.520]   I think there's going to be investment opportunities in systems to create more farmers.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.960]   One person can only make so much from farming, right?
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.080]   Let's be honest.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.480]   My farm is very profitable for its size.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.240]   I can do $80,000 on a third of an acre, probably more next year.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.680]   But I work full days.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.040]   I work a full-time job.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.240]   I'm happy to say now I don't work much more than 40 hours a week.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.480]   But a person isn't going to gain that overnight.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.880]   But still, that's just $80,000.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.080]   I've got to pay an employee in there.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.440]   I've got some expenses as well.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.440]   Getting farming isn't a get-rich thing, especially on the small scale.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.800]   But I think the information…
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.560]   We have to train a lot of farmers, and I can't do it myself.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.240]   We need to get more farmers who can do what I can do and also get out there as well.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:46.720]   Because if we say that it's an aging population of farmers and less than 2% of people in North
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:52.080]   America know how to farm anymore, hey, there's 98% of people or whatever it is we want to get
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.880]   farmers back up to as far as percentage of the population.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.240]   There's a lot of people to train.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.920]   And there's a lot of people without jobs in the US right now.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.760]   And hey, there's a lot of opportunities there for people.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.360]   I like what you say, though, about the paid apprentice model.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.880]   I think that's going to…
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   That is probably coming over time.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.040]   And it's kind of a mixture.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:25.920]   Because if you actually look at some of the heroes, I mean, the reality of a paid apprentice
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.120]   is going to attract probably a different caliber of person.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.240]   And if I were serious about getting into farming, I bet you what I would do, how I would approach
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:41.360]   it, I would go and woof somewhere or volunteer somewhere for a few weeks and let the romanticism
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.160]   get out of my blood and just get into the hard work.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.640]   OK, I wouldn't pay money until I'd first dealt with the fact of, "Joshua, are you being
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.240]   romantic about this lifestyle?"
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:50.640]   Exactly.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.520]   That's a great point.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.080]   Or, "Are you actually serious about willing to do this?"
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.920]   And once I got that out of my blood, man, I would pay anything I had.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.080]   Assuming I had a little bit of savings, and if I didn't, I would get some.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   I want the best instruction in the world.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.160]   So I want to go.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.640]   And if I had to pay to go and work on Lawton's farm, or if I had to go and pay to work on
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.600]   Salatin's farm, or if I had to go to pay and work with, I don't know, Mark Shepard or Greg
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:21.760]   Judy or whoever the other kind of heroes of the faith, so to speak, I would pay.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.360]   Because, A, that's going to get me social access.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.000]   Salatin launches his interns, and they've got their business set because we're part
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.120]   of the Salatin brand.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.480]   Well, and there's a model there, too.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.200]   Right.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.640]   There is a pay model there, too.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.240]   And that's the thing where, that's what it really is.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.040]   From my end, anybody can come to my lectures, anybody can come to my workshops.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040]   That's a cheaper way to get my time.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:48.800]   But if you want my time on the farm, you're going to pay because I don't have time to
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.120]   waste on people that aren't going to be successful.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:51.680]   Right.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.080]   If you're going to come on my farm, you're going to pay that because I want to make sure
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.400]   that you, like just what you said, Josh, is a great point, is going through some wolfing.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.880]   It isn't just a romantic idea anymore.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.760]   They're committed.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.560]   They want to do this because I want to see a million more.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.000]   I want to see 30 million new farmers start in North America.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.440]   And I want to make sure that everybody that I spend time with personally is on that track
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.080]   because I want them to also do what I do.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.320]   Not everybody is going to be as much of an advocate as I am, and that's fine.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:33.040]   But the more successful farming models that we see out there will create those advocates.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:33.840]   That's what I want.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.840]   I want to have impact that way.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.080]   So, yeah, if you're coming to my farm, you're going to pay for it because you're going to
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.160]   get the highest quality value you can.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.840]   But I want to make sure that you're committed so that you are going to be one of those kind
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.720]   of people.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.120]   And some people just want to farm, and that's totally fine.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:56.000]   But I think we'll have a crazy ripple effect once we get more people out there talking
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.520]   about it and inspiring people where this becomes a mainstream thing.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.400]   I want it to become in the next few years.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.240]   I want to see it become mainstream where you know a farmer now.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.440]   I mean, I'm still within the thousands of people that I've met in my life, I'm still
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   probably one of five people that actually farm for a living.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.600]   It's rare.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:24.800]   I know more people that have studied public relations or political science or fine arts
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.160]   than I do farmers.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.040]   And I'm a farmer.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.920]   They're still in a huge minority.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.280]   So I want that to change.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:31.780]   Interesting.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.200]   Interesting.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.560]   I have to provide the counter argument for the stuff that we were talking about with
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.360]   college.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.720]   That's what college used to be and still is in some places.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:47.040]   The reason you pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a prestigious exclusive university
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.040]   is you're paying for social access.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.640]   And it's still worth the money for people who are getting social access.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.000]   And there always has been and there still is for those who didn't have the money.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.320]   In the same way that if there was somebody that came to you and got your attention through
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.960]   their hard work and through their dedication and through their whatever, just their character
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.120]   qualities, even if they didn't have the money, you would bring them under your wing.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   And that's what still you can still do that if you don't have the money to pay for access
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.760]   to that social circle, then it would still happen.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.920]   So that was the whole point of university originally is to allow the social circles
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.640]   to stay pure.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.280]   And that's the whole point of the boarding school system.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.480]   That's the whole point of Harvard.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.840]   That's the whole point of I mean, there's a reason why every I don't know how it is
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.120]   in Canada, but in the United States, you don't you don't get to be president unless you're
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:33.680]   part of the club.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.160]   You know, there's a Harvard or Yale somewhere in your in your somewhere in your history
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.560]   or a bunch of them somewhere in your family.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:40.960]   Totally.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.280]   And if you and the key is, is like, I mean, this sounds cliche, but the key is if you
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.680]   really want to make it happen, you'll make it happen.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:53.040]   And I just find as unfortunate as it is, is that sometimes a dollar value is just a better
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.480]   way of vetting the person.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:00.880]   Like, I don't want I'm not trying to say, oh, to get access to me or this kind of farming
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.400]   requires X amount of dollars.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.840]   I'm not saying that at all.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:10.240]   But what I am saying is that that dollar figure more often than not will represent a person's
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.000]   will to do it.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.240]   So like just like you said, at the university, if you really will work your ass off and make
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.960]   it happen, then you're going to have that be in that mindset of that more abundance
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.120]   mindset than the scarcity mindset.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.560]   And that's often I hear that a lot.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:31.200]   I mean, I get people that say, oh, well, you know, what about why don't you have like X
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.360]   amount of free tickets for people that are marginalized or whatever?
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.920]   And, you know, it's like and we do we always do in our workshops, there's always some
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:46.640]   kind of like scholarship or free stuff to some degree, but you can't help everybody.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.400]   But it's like if you're stuck in that scarcity mindset, well, then this might not be for
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   you.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:58.160]   You if you want to do this successfully, you got to get out of that mindset and start to
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.400]   see the abundance that actually exists in the world.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:06.160]   Because frankly, the guys that are really rich in the world, Warren Buffett, whatever,
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.400]   love him or hate him.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.080]   They're in that they're in that mindset.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:12.520]   They're in that abundance mindset and abundance attracts abundance.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.160]   And nature is abundance.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.320]   It's the law of nature.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.400]   It's the law of abundance.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.500]   One lettuce plant will produce a thousand seeds to reproduce itself.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500]   Nature itself is abundant.
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.800]   And people need to get out of the mindset of scarcity.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.720]   People you know, it's like climate change this or we're screwing the planet.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.760]   And I won't say we aren't, but there's still a lot of abundance.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:41.600]   There's still so many opportunities, but don't let the mainstream media convince you that
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.560]   it's all going to shit and there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.240]   You know, that you can do something about it.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.280]   You just got to believe in yourself and take action.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:55.920]   I will listen to anybody who wants to convince me that climate change is going to result
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.060]   in the death of all of us.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:02.200]   If they can illustrate to me what they're actually doing that actually makes a difference.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:08.920]   I listen to those people with ears wide open because I simply don't know.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.640]   I'm done listening to people who tell me that here's why the world is going to crazy.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.320]   So therefore that's why we got to control your life and tax you.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.320]   Exactly.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.320]   I'm done.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.320]   I refuse to.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.760]   When you show me that you're out greening the desert, I'll listen to you on climate
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   change.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.440]   When there are people who are greening the desert and you're not, sorry, like you don't
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.440]   have a ground to stand on.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.840]   I know people that can go out and green the desert and you take one half of one percent
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.520]   of what you're spending on all the rest of the stuff of controlling people and you give
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.920]   it to the people that are out greening the desert.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.520]   And man, you can change the climate.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   We can make rain.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.800]   We can make grain.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]   We can make green.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.360]   We can soak up all kinds of carbon dioxide.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.480]   It's tree food.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.200]   And when you show me you're actually putting your money where your mouth is and you're
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.400]   not just sitting around trying to control me, I'll believe it.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.400]   That's exactly it.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   I'm sold.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.680]   It's all the same mechanisms that are used over and over again in history and people
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.200]   don't really seem to learn.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.160]   The people that do will and they'll always be the change makers.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.480]   But it's just all this fear crap.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:15.760]   I mean, yeah, I'm not saying that climate change exists or not.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.840]   I actually personally see effects of it.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.800]   What is caused by that, I don't know.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800]   I'm not a scientist.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.560]   I listen to some scientists, but I also see different opinions on it.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.920]   So in the end, it doesn't matter to me because in the end, I'm still riding a bike every
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920]   day.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.040]   I'm still green in the urban areas that I live in.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.840]   I'm still doing the best I can all the time.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.960]   And that's all that matters.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.320]   I've gone down the rabbit hole, Josh, with probably every conspiracy theory that you
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.640]   can imagine.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640]   And I've gone through periods.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   It's endless.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.640]   Well, yeah.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:52.200]   And the thing is I often start, I'm starting to see that there's people that benefit from
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.960]   that fear.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.040]   And so I'm going, you know what?
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.480]   Hey, I believe a lot of stuff.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.960]   I'm sure it exists.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   But you know what?
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.480]   I'm not going to be afraid because that doesn't help me at the end of the day.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.400]   It doesn't help anybody at the end of the day to give up and say, oh, this 1% control
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.400]   everything and all that.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.440]   It's like, who cares?
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.020]   Maybe they've figured out something that we haven't.
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.600]   Maybe there's some things we can learn from them.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:26.560]   I'm just so tired of this race baiting and this class baiting of people saying it's us
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560]   against them.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.480]   I'm so tired of that crap because it doesn't get you.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.320]   It doesn't change your position.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.800]   It doesn't help you.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.320]   Whether it's true or not, whether there's some people have privileges and some don't.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   Yeah, they do.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   Get over it.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   Move on.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:45.320]   Everybody can say that somebody else has it better than they do.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.520]   Even in the 1%, my family only makes $100 million a year.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.440]   Well, this guy's family makes a billion dollars a year.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.400]   Somebody is always going to have it better and somebody is always going to have it worse.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   Get over it.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   Move on.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   Believe in yourself.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.600]   Put one foot in front of the other and just make it happen.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.840]   Stop complaining and just do it.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.200]   I'm just so tired of the people that are just – they're well-intended.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.520]   There's a lot of – there's a saying.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.200]   I don't know who says it but it's like the road to hell is paved by good intentions.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.760]   I see that so much in the mainstream media especially because the mainstream media has
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.320]   really gone to the left as far as Obama.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.200]   I grew up in a left family.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:35.760]   I mean I have a lot of left opinions in a way but when it comes to making people afraid
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.920]   of each other, especially when it comes to like, "Well, you're a black person and
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.120]   I'm a white person and you have this and you have that," it's like who cares?
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.120]   We're humans.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.120]   I'm a human being.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.360]   Why don't you just call me by my name instead of calling me about what I am.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.280]   Like I'm a farmer and I'm a human.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.920]   That's good enough for me.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.960]   Let's work together and make things happen.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.400]   There's a time of personal transformation.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.960]   Sometimes I think where people react, I know where I reacted and who knows, maybe I still
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.880]   do and who knows, maybe I still will.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.040]   Because you get disillusioned when you find out you were lied to.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.720]   That's tough to take.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:21.160]   No matter what it is, whether it's when I was a kid I thought my parents were perfect
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.800]   and then I realized they were people and you're like, "Wow, that's disillusioning.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.160]   Here I was, I thought my parents were perfect."
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.440]   Or when you think, "Wow, my political party is, wait a second, what's going on?
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   I've been lied to."
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.120]   It's kind of disillusioning and it takes a little time to get over it.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.080]   But the good news is that more people who can live and again, goes back to that open
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.640]   information and open discussion, that can be super valuable for people.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.240]   So Curtis, we're recording this on Monday the 26th.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.040]   When are you going to be in Florida again?
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.040]   Tomorrow.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.880]   I'll be in Florida tomorrow, leaving on the 27th.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.640]   I'll be in Gainesville January 28th for a free lecture.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.280]   So I think we've got room for a lot of people.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.440]   Come out, check it out.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.720]   That might inspire you to come to the workshop in Gainesville the next day, which is a one-day
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.720]   workshop.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.600]   But then I've got a two-day workshop in Orlando, which is, there's a lot of information
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.320]   in the one day you'll get.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:18.120]   Just with two days, of course, there's going to be a little bit more stuff.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.640]   Then I'm on my way to Long Beach, California.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.440]   After that, I'm going to be in Seattle on the 14th of February, back in BC on the 21st,
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.200]   doing a workshop in Puerto Vallarta, which I'm pretty stoked about.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.200]   Fun, awesome.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.040]   On February 28th, March 1st.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.040]   Anybody can just go on my website, greencityacres.com.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.760]   I've got all those dates there.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:39.040]   If people are interested in my online course that I have coming up, the basic premise of
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.280]   this course is I want to save you two or three years of the mistakes I made and get you ahead
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.600]   so you can start making money as a farmer right away.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.200]   It's profitableurbanfarming.com.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.440]   They can sign up to the newsletter and they'll get a notification when the course is released.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.440]   Do you have an estimate of when you think you're going to be publishing the course?
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.200]   We're hoping we're shooting for one month from today.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.640]   We're in post-production right now.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.280]   We're editing the last bits of video and the content is up.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.080]   It's a really cool site where you can navigate.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.160]   It views like a book with chapters and sub-chapters.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.040]   You can read content and then there's videos on how to do stuff.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.520]   I've been filming content for this thing for two and a half years now.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.060]   It's got tons of stuff in it.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:25.960]   If I would have seen this stuff, man, it would have saved me a lot of time.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.440]   Are you doing a big timed launch videos, the product launch formula?
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.680]   Are you just doing a simple launch?
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.400]   What kind of launch are you doing?
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.920]   We're kind of launching it.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.080]   I don't know exactly.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:44.480]   I have a partner in the US named Luke Callahan and he manages the production.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.000]   What we're doing is we're just going to launch it because we want to get this information
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.920]   out to people.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.720]   We're going to launch it for a lot cheaper than what it's worth, basically.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.080]   I don't know the price exactly, but we're going to launch it for probably half of what
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.680]   it will be over time.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.440]   We want to get the information out there and we want to get people using it.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.280]   We're committed to making it better and better constantly.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.760]   When you sign up for it, you get access to it forever.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.280]   We want to make it better over time.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280]   It's slick.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:20.540]   This thing is, like I said, the information is so valuable and it goes into so much detail.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.640]   You can watch it from the convenient of your own home.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.960]   You can view it on an iPad when you're out in the field.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.440]   How did Curtis do that thing?
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.480]   You can pull up the video and watch me do it.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   Awesome.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.160]   Tell you what, give me a week or two, but then let's see if we can get you back on.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.840]   You prepare some thoughts and let's go ahead and give some info to help you with your course
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.680]   launch.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.680]   Let's do another recording.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.680]   It was a fun conversation.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.960]   We kind of got off base.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.920]   Let's see if we can help you with your course launch.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.240]   I know for a number of my audience that'll be helpful.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.560]   Maybe you can put together some more of the outline that we're going to go with today
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.080]   on how to get into urban farming and that'll help you get some people in that course.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.080]   I'd like to do that if you're willing.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.760]   Great, yeah, absolutely Josh.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   Anytime.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   Awesome.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760]   Maybe I'll see you in a few days.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.280]   If I can make it to Orlando, I will be there.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280]   I'm not sure about it.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.160]   It's a busy week, but if I can make it to Orlando, I'll be there.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.080]   Anyway, thank you for coming on.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.040]   I'm sure this is going to be a hit with the audience.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.240]   If the first one is any indication, this one's also going to be quite well received.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.240]   Awesome, yeah.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.040]   I look forward to it.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.280]   I love that kind of interview because it can really be a solution for many people.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:31.360]   As I know from the emails that I've received and also the emails that Curtis has received,
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.480]   it's a solution for at least a few of you.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.800]   I hope some of the ideas, some of the information in today's show made a difference for you.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.720]   As far as I'm concerned, if it makes a difference for even one or two people, it's worth it.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.080]   I know that it's made a difference for more people than that.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   It's amazing to me.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.080]   We have over 18,000 downloads of that show.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:54.240]   Excuse me, just under 18,949 downloads of that show.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240]   It's a great one.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.240]   I hope this was inspirational to you.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.240]   I hope it was encouraging.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.560]   I hope you learned something.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.680]   I'll make sure to bring Curtis back on with some of the meat and potatoes.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:10.720]   We'll stay away from philosophy and try to give you some actionable strategies when he
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.040]   gets ready to launch his course.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.240]   I didn't know when he was getting ready to do that, but we'll make sure to do that in
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.400]   the next few weeks or next month or so whenever it happens.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.400]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.040]   I appreciate each and every one of you being here.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.840]   Thank you for the support for the show.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.160]   I really value it and I simply say that.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.160]   Thank you for listening.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.900]   If you'd like to support the show financially, please consider joining the membership program.
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:36.400]   You can find the details at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/membership.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:41.240]   But that is the way that I'm building to fund the show and fund my ability to bring this
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.880]   to you about five days a week.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:48.760]   I try to bring you straightforward, as unbiased as possible.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:53.160]   None of us can fully get away from our own bias, but I try to give you as much unbiased
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.920]   information as I can.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:58.160]   When I do have bias, I try to disclose it at least so then you can understand and you
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.320]   can factor that in when making your own decisions.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.160]   I'm not necessarily right in everything.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.200]   I'll just share what I've learned and why I think the way that I do.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:11.360]   Hopefully, as a thinking person, you can understand what's right for you.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.360]   So that's it.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360]   Thank you so much.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.360]   Talk to you tomorrow.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:14.360]   [music]
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:19.360]   [music]
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.360]   [music]
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:29.360]   [music]
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   [music]
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.360]   [music]
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   [music]
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.360]   [music]
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:56.960]   If you'd like to contact me personally, my email address is Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.

[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:11.240]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:17.200]   But your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.120]   anything about you.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:26.480]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:32.720]   trustworthy and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:39.800]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:44.960]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.720]   and I make mistakes.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:51.160]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please help me by coming to the show page
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.720]   and commenting so we can all learn together.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.720]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
