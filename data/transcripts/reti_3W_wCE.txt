[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   All right.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Let's see here.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   All right.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Next question we got from Mika, and he asked, "Does listening to a podcast count as reading?"
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   No, I don't count it the same.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I think these are two different classes of intellectual substance that you're ingesting.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Here's the quick way I discern between the two.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So when you're reading a book, you're ingesting a fully formed, carefully thought through
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   thought structure.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And we're talking nonfiction here.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   But you have a writer who has really thought something through.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It might be their lifelong expertise or something they researched deeply.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   They spent a long time trying to organize these thoughts into a structure that is internally
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   coherent and makes sense and has been validated.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   So when you're reading a good nonfiction book, you can basically take this well-crafted
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   thought structure and just graft it onto your cognitive framework.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Oh, now I understand, you know, the influence of cryptocurrency on whatever.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Yeah, currency markets.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Plug that in.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Podcast, it's more conversational.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I think of podcast as a source of the type of material with which you could build one
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   of these structured thoughts, right?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Or I might learn a bunch of interesting stuff from a podcast, but there's still a lot of
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   work to be done probably to take the various things I heard in this interview or got out
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   of this conversation and mix it with things I've learned elsewhere and build it together
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   into a coherent thought.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   To build it together into something I could write 10,000 words on or write a book about.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So you're getting raw thought stuff on podcast than in books.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   That's why I think about it differently.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It's also why it's less cognitively demanding to listen to a podcast.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You can zone in and out, be in conversational mode.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And when you hear something interesting, then pay attention and sort of collect that
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   for use later.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So I see it as being different things.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   The exception, of course, is this podcast.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Nothing about this is raw.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   This is all finely honed intellectual material.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   My proposal, and I think this is reasonable, is that listening to this podcast should legally
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   be equivalent to being awarded a doctorate from an accredited university.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And that's just one man's opinion.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   What's your view on podcasts versus music?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Different things.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Music's an aesthetic experience.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Especially if you have music appreciation, either it's an appreciation experience,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   like I just really enjoy this musician, or it's kind of like a neurotropic experience.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I'm working out and I want to whatever, just get fired up.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Or it's just want to get lost or listen to something funny, like mood alteration.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So it's like an aesthetic experience, mood alteration.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I think it's different than information ingestion.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So I count them differently.
