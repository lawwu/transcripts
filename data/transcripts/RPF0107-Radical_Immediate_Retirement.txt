[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Today on the show, we're going to talk about retirement.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.320]   I warn you right now, if you're an uptight, obsessive, compulsive planner like I am, today's
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.680]   show is probably going to make you a little bit uncomfortable, which probably means it's
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.800]   a show you should listen to.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.080]   We're talking today about radical immediate retirement.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   My guest was an attorney, middle of his career, kind of the height of his career, and then
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   just decided he was done.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:47.200]   Chucked it all and wandered off without a plan, going on walkabout.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.160]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340]   Thank you for being here.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.040]   Today is Friday, November 21, 2014.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.080]   Today I'm bringing you an interview with a man named David Downey.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.480]   He's from Australia.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.280]   He just decided to simply quit.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.840]   Didn't worry too much about the planning or the details, but he just quit.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.520]   Should be fun.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.560]   My guest today sent me an email and he says, "I wrote this book called Radical Immediate
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.560]   Retirement.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.600]   I like some of the stuff that you talk about.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   Check it out and enjoy it."
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.240]   So I take his book and I read it, read his book, and I did enjoy it.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480]   Basically, the title says it all.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   It just simply says, "What if we adjusted our mindset and didn't worry too much about
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.200]   all the technical stuff?
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.880]   We just adjusted our mindset.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.520]   If in doing so, could we achieve something different?"
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.120]   I've got an interview with him today.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.120]   He's a really interesting guy.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.840]   He was an attorney, a high-ranking, high-class attorney living a high-spending lifestyle
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.680]   and just decided, "You know what?
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.080]   This isn't working," and decided to change and worked through the process of making some
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   changes.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   Did it fairly quickly.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.800]   I think the Radical Immediate Retirement is probably a little bit of an overstatement.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.680]   It wasn't quite immediate, but it was pretty quick.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.720]   He basically just bailed on his job and in favor of another approach.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.400]   Since then, he's written children's books.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.520]   He's contributed to the book, "1,001 Best Beers That You Have to Taste Before You Die."
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   He kind of helps people with publishing projects and he travels.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.840]   He does all these interesting projects.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.520]   So give this show a listen.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.440]   It was definitely an interesting interview.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.840]   I think that I always need a little bit of that kind of loose and flexible approach in
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   my life.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.560]   It helps me to keep balance.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400]   Before we get to that, a couple of quick announcements.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.200]   I hope you guys enjoyed yesterday's show.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.920]   It was pretty hardcore and pretty in-depth.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.040]   I'm skipping the Friday Q&A today just because yesterday's show was so long and I thought
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.320]   that this would be a fun way to go into the interview.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.240]   But please keep sending me your questions and keep sending me those on the website with
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   the "Leave Me a Voicemail" function that's right on the website and also on your phone
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040]   via email.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   On note, however, if you want, you can just record a nice audio file for me on a phone.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   Keep it short.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.660]   Keep it a minute or two long and send me the audio file that you have for me on the phone
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.800]   and I can use that as well.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.400]   So that would be fine if you don't want to use the app on the website.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.420]   That doesn't matter to me.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.400]   Next week, I've got a great week of shows lined up.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.000]   Quick reminder for those of you who are subscribed in iTunes, make sure to, if you're not receiving
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.800]   updates on the show, just simply unsubscribe, search for the show and then subscribe.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.360]   And I'll fix that for you.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.440]   Real quick, request for help from you.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.720]   This is the major input that I wanted to say.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.080]   I would love you guys' input on show topics and guests.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   I've gotten several great ideas from many of you.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.600]   But I want you to know that every time you send me an email, which is joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.920]   every time you send me an email, I make a note of that.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.680]   And if you have an idea for a show topic or if you have an idea for a guest, what would
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.880]   be most helpful is if you think there's an interesting guest, have the guest respond
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.200]   to me with their story and just have them tell me that it was a listener and request
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.720]   the interview and then that can help me to set it up and save me from having to go and
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.920]   find them.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.100]   But that would help the most.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.120]   But I'm still willing if there's somebody that you think is great and you say, "Hey,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   check this person out.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120]   I'd love to interview them."
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.600]   And I'm very sensitive to the topics that you guys are suggesting.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   Real quick, how I think about the way that I approach the show.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   I just simply do shows about things that I'm interested in or that I think are helpful
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   and are valuable.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.760]   And I don't really know what other model I would apply to it at least at this time.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.160]   So when I do a show, it's a topic that I'm interested in.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.760]   It's often a book I've read or something I'm interested in talking about.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.860]   But what I'm learning is now that the audience is growing, I'm learning that there are subjects
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.160]   that are of interest to you, the audience.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.360]   And there are things I hadn't thought about.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360]   I'll give you some examples.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.520]   I had never thought about necessarily doing shows on international topics, shows on finance
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.360]   from a Canadian perspective or from a German perspective.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.760]   But I've had several listeners email me and say, "Hey, could you bring somebody on?"
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.660]   So this week I've been working on a reach out to several Canadian personal finance people
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.520]   that are active in that community and they were based upon your suggestions.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.560]   And I think a couple of them are going to be coming on the show.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.100]   I'm happy to do that about anything.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.960]   Another one that listeners have asked about is to have more women on the show.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.120]   Frankly, I never even thought about, I don't think about gender, what gender somebody is.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.720]   It doesn't even cross my mind.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.280]   I just think, am I interested in this person's topic?
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.200]   But I got some comments and people saying, "Hey, could you have some women on the show?"
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   I would love to.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.440]   So if you have something that you think would be a benefit for the show, if you're a listener,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.000]   I love to bring listeners on because I despise the idea that we're just going to get experts
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.700]   and I'm going to go and bring in all these experts.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.040]   Experts are great, but you know what?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.440]   Sometimes they're really unrelatable.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   So I'd be happy to talk with listeners.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.800]   I like talking with listeners.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.840]   I think that's really useful content.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.000]   It keeps the more humble approach to the show that I think is important.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.840]   I love talking to experts as well.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.320]   But if you would like to come on the show, feel free to send me an email.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.920]   Just share with me a little bit about what you think would be of interest to the show.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.080]   I take a lot of those emails and many people that I've had on have been because they've
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   reached out to me.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.240]   I'm happy to do that.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.120]   And then if you have somebody that you know has an interesting story, if you see a hole
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.440]   in some of the content that I've been bringing, if you see that I don't have enough Canadians
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.980]   on or I don't have enough women on or something like that, just let me know and suggest somebody
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.980]   for me.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.440]   It's the first time I've ever done this as far as designing programming and trying to
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   figure out how do I set this up.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.360]   So I'm winging it and I'm figuring it out as I go.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.760]   I don't sit down.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.380]   My brain doesn't work at saying, "Let me sit down and create a balanced approach to
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.380]   all these things."
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.680]   I do that, I guess, with the financial content.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   I jump around to these different areas, estate, insurance, investments.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   I try to keep that varied.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.920]   But with regard to maybe things like what country are you from or, "Josh, will you
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.360]   just have all these men on the show?"
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.800]   I don't even think about that stuff.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.560]   So if there's somebody that you would like to have on the show, let me know and I would
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   be glad to do that.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.960]   Because I do want to be sensitive to what you as the audience request.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   I read all the emails.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.960]   I have a notebook with all of the topics that you have suggested.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.320]   Some of them I'm able to do just right off the top of my head.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.200]   Some of them require a lot of research and they're on there on my research list.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.800]   Some of them I just think, "Well, I'll figure out how to do this when I can figure
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   it out."
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.880]   So I just wanted you to know if you would like to see some sort of content covered on
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.800]   the show, you can help.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.240]   I will ask for your help and I'm listening to you, the audience, as it grows.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.040]   So I hope you take me up on that.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.240]   I appreciate the help.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   I really do.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.320]   So here's the interview with David, a really great guy.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.360]   Enjoy.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.600]   So David, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.800]   I appreciate you being with me.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.600]   It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.320]   I am excited to talk to you because I think the concepts that we are going to talk about,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:27.480]   the concepts of your book, are going to provide a really radical departure from how financial
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.240]   advice is usually given.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.280]   But I think it's going to really enhance people's perspectives.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.520]   So let's start with your story.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.920]   Share with me a little bit about your story and your own personal retirement plan.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   Okay.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.480]   Well, I think the main observation on my story is that I didn't really have a retirement
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.440]   plan, which I think is pretty well the same as most other people out there in the workforce.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.160]   I was a young, keen student.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.080]   I guess I followed the same system that a lot of Western young achievers do.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.400]   I was in a framework that someone else invented.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.720]   I was told which ladder to climb.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.880]   I did really well at school, went to university here in Australia, focused on getting the
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.680]   marks, was at university for a long time, got a great job in a big law firm and worked
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.720]   in the law firm for over 10 years, probably 15 years, became partner at a law firm, was
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.680]   finally on the money.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.600]   And then I thought, you know what, I don't want to be spending my time this way.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   I want to radically and immediately stop this, really with no retirement plan.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.080]   I stopped it.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.100]   This is probably about a year and a half ago.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.160]   And I've gone through a period of enormous transformation, I guess, during that time
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.000]   of sort of seeing the light financially.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.800]   I've seen what's important and I've developed this sort of collection of concepts which
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.640]   has really helped me mentally, financially, in terms of enjoying my life, which is the
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   goal.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.040]   And I've just scratched them down in this little collection and I hope it's motivating
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.360]   for people and I guess demonstrates that there can be another way and inspires people in
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.400]   the way I've been inspired by the sort of writers out there who have shared their story.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:19.000]   It's interesting just simply because it seems like we all need a system and we usually just
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.440]   kind of take on the system that our society gives to us and then some people at some point
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.240]   stop and say, "Wait a minute, am I really in favor of this system or not?
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.380]   Or am I really going to continue following it or not?"
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.920]   And you have a quote in your book.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.400]   Go ahead.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.600]   Sorry, you just cut out there.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   Okay.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   You're back now.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   Yeah, we're back now.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.920]   So, saying like we need a system to follow.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.840]   You have a quote in your book, two of them really stood out to me and they're in your
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.720]   chapter on freedom.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.380]   And the first quote was by Voltaire and the quote is, "Man is free at the moment he wishes
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.800]   to be."
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.040]   And then the second quote was by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and he said, "None are more hopelessly
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.080]   enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free."
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   And to me that kind of sums up the paradox of the Western culture better than anything
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.240]   else that you read is that we all believe we're free but in reality the question is,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   are we?
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   Well, that's right.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.400]   I think we're free really to buy people's products and pay taxes.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.820]   That seems to be what the system's geared towards.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:41.240]   And if you want to spend your time differently, you have to behave differently and I guess
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.320]   turn off your mind to those messages and start thinking for yourself or following other messages
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.960]   which result in you leading a better life.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.800]   What were the series of events and what were the influences that led to your deciding to
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.240]   make such a radical change in your lifestyle?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:06.600]   Well, I guess I was increasingly unhappy with spending my time in an office and I think
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.760]   a lot of people have observed that humans are happiest, at least a lot of us are happiest,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.240]   when we're acquiring new skills and doing what we enjoy and exercising control over
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   how we spend our time.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.840]   And I was in a highly specialized area that took a long time to become competent in.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.560]   I was a partner in intellectual property and commercial contracts in a large law firm.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.400]   But to be honest, I became good at that some time ago.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.720]   And so I was spending day after day, month after month, year after year effectively solving
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   the same problems.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:43.600]   And by then I was an autopilot and I was just, I guess, going a bit crazy doing the same
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   job over and over.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.400]   I'm sure dentists and accountants and financial planners suffer the same fate.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   Absolutely.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Situations.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.560]   And I mean, a lot of us in law firms and in many occupations are quite creative, interested
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.200]   people, and this drudgery just sucks the life out of you over time.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.880]   So I knew I wasn't happy doing that.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.180]   But when you're in that system, and I think like a lot of people, I suffered from a bit
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.160]   of lifestyle creep.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.240]   You start off as a student and a lot of us are happiest when we're a student, but then
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.920]   we forget that we're happiest when we're a student and we're not sure why.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   But we acquire cars and houses or other investments or drinking fancy beers or wines or going
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.080]   out to expensive restaurants and all of a sudden the income that you're on, which seemed
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.240]   like a luxury when you first obtained it, is now a necessity.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.920]   And a lot of my coworkers, even those who have been on a lot of money for a long time,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.440]   are still in debt.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.040]   And so it seems impossible to live any sort of other life.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.400]   And you pity people who aren't earning as much cash.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.040]   But I knew something was missing and I wanted out.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.400]   In terms of the influences on me, Jacob, who I know you've interviewed from earlier time
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.040]   and extreme, I found him as a lot do and I think probably as a lot do.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:07.880]   I was angry and outraged by his assertions and I saw him as advocating homelessness and
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.920]   I saw him as a perpetual student.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.080]   And I'd worked so hard for so long to not be a student.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.800]   And I actually was so angry.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:28.880]   I think I left him a two star review on Amazon and an angry rant that all his followers jumped
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.160]   in and attacked me about and I attacked them.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.200]   And then he came in and I attacked him not knowing it was him.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.800]   Then I apologized knowing it was him and said, look, you're even back at work.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   You know, I've got a good job.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   You've got a good job.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   What's the point?
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   You can just say be a student forever.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   So that happened.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.040]   But then I just kept returning to the book, his book, Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   I recommend it.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   I recommend his blog.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.160]   He's an extremely influential character.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.720]   I kept returning to it and some of his concepts just really sort of spoke to me about how
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.160]   about the choices that you have and how do you want to spend your time.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.400]   And you've spoken at length about what he said, but he was an influence.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.600]   A second character who was a major influence, although I'm different to each of these people,
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.800]   obviously I've taken my own path and that's written about in the book, was Tim Ferriss.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.080]   He's a well-known name amongst our community with his four-hour work week.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.400]   You know, I think the guy just had insight that was incredible for such a young man.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.920]   He must have only 25 or 26 when he wrote the book and it's brilliantly written.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.640]   At the time, it was completely radical and he, I think, Ferriss at the end of the day,
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.520]   he can see trends slightly ahead of the curve.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.480]   He can translate it into language that people understand and he's a fabulous motivator.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.560]   And I found his book motivating.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.400]   I think my philosophy now is a bit different to his and I guess with Jacob's influence
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:57.280]   and my own thinking, Ferriss speaks about, it's a great line and it's an observation
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.320]   that you don't want to be a millionaire, you want to live like a millionaire.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:07.800]   And so where if you can use your brain to solve, I guess, your problems and if problems
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.040]   or outcomes you want to say be skiing and living, not going to work every day, you don't
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.200]   necessarily have to use millions of dollars to solve that problem.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.280]   You can solve that problem using geo-arbitrage, living in different countries, taking advantage
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   of exchange rates.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.440]   You can solve that problem by having cash flow rather than wealth.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.960]   And you can solve the problem by observing that if we are interested in active people,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.440]   then we're not really going to retire and sit around, are we?
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.920]   We're always going to be doing something.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.040]   And if you don't need to plan for retirement so much, knowing that you're going to be active
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.800]   and interested, then you don't need the cash.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.920]   And that's a pretty powerful observation.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:48.640]   Although in my case, I think, and this is where Jacob comes into it, it's not you don't
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.440]   want to be a millionaire, you want to live like a millionaire.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.120]   I don't want to live like a millionaire with all the fancy stuff.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.800]   I think Ferriss is a bit of an extrovert rock star.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.920]   He says in his book, I live like a rock star.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.680]   I don't want to live like a rock star.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.120]   And I don't think you have to live like a rock star.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.840]   I want to live efficiently.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.720]   And that's something I think is worth talking about as well.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.440]   I know there's a word going around in all of the old days, people used to talk about
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   voluntary simplicity.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.520]   And there's great books out there that talk about voluntarily living in a simple fashion
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.240]   and being quite frugal.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.920]   And I guess if you've read a lot of that stuff, frugality sounds fine.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.360]   But to most people, if you talk about frugality, it sounds like something your grandma's grandpa
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   would get up to.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.160]   And it sounds pretty horrible.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.120]   But one concept I got from Jacob, which I've really run with in my own mind, is that of
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.160]   being efficient rather than frugal.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.280]   And I think it's a much better word to use.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.760]   And mentally, who wouldn't want to be efficient?
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.320]   And I think of someone walking past a beer tap running out onto the ground.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.280]   I mean, it's not an outcome anyone would want.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.400]   And I think all of us would run over with the greatest urgency and turn that beer tap
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   off.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   Right.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:06.440]   And I think a lot of people's lives are like that running beer tap, just wasting money.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.360]   They're driving a car that uses 10 times the petrol of a normal car.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.680]   And it's crazy.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.800]   And when you look at it that way, in terms of waste and inefficiency, and you'd much
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.000]   prefer to be a well-oiled machine, you'd much prefer to be the beer tap that just turns
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.760]   on when someone wants a beer, then that empowers you, I think, to live a different lifestyle
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.400]   and one that doesn't involve waste.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.760]   And that's an extremely powerful concept, because the less wasteful you are, the more
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.920]   efficient you are, then the less of this stuff we call money you need to live your life.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.720]   And if the goal is to live the life of being free, doing what you want to do, then one
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.840]   way to get there is not to have millions and live like a rock star, but to live efficiently
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.680]   and just have as much cash as you need to live the way you want to live.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.400]   I think your story about being angry at Jacob is a valuable story, because I think many
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.200]   people have the same perspective, especially when they read him.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:11.400]   I mean, he's rather extreme in the way that we say it, in comparison to our modern culture.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:17.640]   But when you get down to it, you find that the concepts that he shares really just make
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   sense.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.280]   And you say, "Wait, why do I do that?"
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.080]   And I think we get a little frustrated, because, at least for me, when I read his book, I felt
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.800]   like I had been bamboozled prior to that.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.600]   I felt like I had been following somebody else's plan of, instead of thinking rationally
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.360]   and making my own plan, I felt like I had just wasted time following somebody else's
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   plan.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.880]   And frankly, I think I did.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   But yet, it's unusual that it would be a remarkable demonstration of character to be able to recognize
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.560]   that you've wasted days, months, weeks, years of your life, tens, hundreds, thousands, hundreds
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.960]   of thousands, perhaps millions of dollars on something that ultimately wasn't serving
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   you well.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.880]   That's a very difficult emotional transition to make.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:16.280]   Well, I must admit, it took me years to get the courage to walk away from the system,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.080]   because I was a very good player in the system.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.040]   And it turns out that, for me, I was climbing the wrong ladder or participating in the wrong
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   game.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.720]   And going back to Ferris's insight, I think a lot of his insight and his book outraged
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.080]   a lot of people at the time as well, I think, at least the older people, came from the fact
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.240]   that he had lived in Japan.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.480]   And he lived in other countries.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.200]   And there's no better way to obtain perspective.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.400]   And Jacob, no doubt, has done this as well, about your own culture than living in others.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.040]   And Ferris says reality is negotiable.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:59.400]   And he sees life as a series of culturally reinforced rules that aren't really based
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.800]   on object reality.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.440]   And yeah, I think a lot of our education-- Jacob talks about this a little bit as well.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.880]   And others have spoken about it.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.440]   Our education system, it's geared towards the Industrial Revolution, churning out people
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.760]   for a factory line.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.840]   And then as we become more sophisticated, more sophisticated specializations.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.280]   And yeah, as children, what do we do?
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.720]   We do what our parents tell us to do.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.120]   We do what our teachers tell us to do.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.520]   If I had my time over, and I don't have children-- and we probably should chat about that briefly,
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.040]   I think, kids, because I can change the equation a little bit.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.520]   I'd like-- I mean, imagine if we taught all our kids from age 12 how to be independent
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.520]   and entrepreneurial.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.400]   What would happen if you did that across the whole culture?
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.760]   And I think particularly for isolated economies, a good internet connection and a revolution
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   in schools, where everyone had to come up with three businesses every semester from
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.360]   age 12, wouldn't it just change the whole country?
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   It would.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   It wouldn't.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.640]   It won't happen with the permission of the forces that be.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.160]   Right before we're recording this, I've released two series on the history of schooling.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.800]   And it wasn't until I actually started studying the actual history of schooling and some of
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.760]   the academic documents on it.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.880]   Because you can look.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.680]   And the two things that always look to me as I said, look, you've got a system that's
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.800]   designed to create good, obedient little factory workers.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.480]   It's an industrial revolution system.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.880]   That's fairly apparent if you just simply look and say, well, the desks all point to
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.960]   the front of the room.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   The teacher stands in the front of the room.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.560]   And there's a bell that goes off to tell people to move to another room.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.000]   And then you go to some historical place.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And you see the picture of the black and white photo of the factory workers.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.140]   And the desks are all pointed the same way.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.680]   And they're working on an assembly line.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.480]   And there's a foreman or a forewoman or something there with the whip.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.080]   Probably not a physical whip, but basically in charge.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.800]   And there's a factory bell in a factory town.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   You say, oh, interesting.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.880]   I can draw that comparison.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.840]   But it's not until you actually go and you start studying some of the academic history
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.920]   and you get into some of the philosophy and you recognize that throughout time, and this
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.980]   is where it's so wacky, throughout time people have tried to figure out, great thinkers have
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.960]   tried to figure out, how do we control a population?
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:25.400]   How do we keep the population from actually, how do we control them together?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:31.280]   And then you go and you see, ah, school was designed as a system of control, a system
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.800]   especially with the heavy Prussian influence.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.720]   And you find out that the major factor here was controlling people and eliminating individual
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.860]   thought.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:47.800]   And so in our modern system, and it's very easy for people to block this out because
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:53.040]   it's really a dramatic, it takes time.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.240]   It took me a long time to come to terms with it.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.480]   Just like you said, it took you time to come to terms with it.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.240]   It's easy to cut this information out and say, oh, that can't be true.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:09.080]   But if you think about it, that we as the individuals who are the workers are indeed
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:15.520]   the, in a sense, we're what creates the money that funds the machine that keeps everything
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.880]   going.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.360]   When I had the war tax protester on the show, I forget his name right now, but he wrote
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.000]   the book on tax protesting.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.400]   Without your and my going to work and earning income, which is then taxed, then our respective
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.360]   governments cannot fund their activities.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.740]   And if they do not go and keep a constant war going, then that cannot fund the owners
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.440]   of the companies that create the war machines that are used to fight the war.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:50.640]   So whether it's designed that way or it just happens that way, that's the practical result.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   Doesn't really matter the cause.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.440]   I mean, maybe it matters a little bit, but it doesn't really matter the cause because
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.400]   you can look at it and say, oh, that's the system I'm involved in.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.160]   And if everybody, it's easy to go back, Thoreau is always the example.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.800]   And Thoreau, I think, is rightly lauded in some ways and wrongfully lauded in other ways
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.440]   because he makes excellent points, but then he's also, there's some major problems in
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.880]   his work, in my opinion.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.960]   But if you go back to it, if we went back to a self-sufficient lifestyle, we went back
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.480]   to less of a division of labor where each person is working in this very specialized
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.400]   business, then the economy would fundamentally transform and it would not be nearly as efficient
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.640]   as creating, at creating tax revenue.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.680]   So when you look at the effects of it and you say, ah, here's just simply how the system
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:42.660]   works, wait a second, I really am in many ways a battery pack that's providing energy
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.120]   that keeps everything just flowing forward.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.480]   And as long as I'm comfortable enough, as long as there's not too much dissatisfaction,
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.920]   too much discomfort, then I as a human being, it's pretty comfortable, change is uncomfortable,
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.080]   so I'll just continue doing it and it's good enough.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.440]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.160]   And I think there are parallels with other sectors of the economy as well, including
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.400]   food, food and diet.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:10.280]   I mean, you just follow the money and the money is what ultimately influences the system
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   and the culture.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.080]   And we've got a fight here in Australia at the moment between our head sort of dietitians
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.920]   association who of course are staunchly defending the ancient food pyramid, which many countries
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.520]   are looking at shifting.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   And who are they sponsored by?
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.120]   They're sponsored by the big multinationals who peddle the stuff that doesn't make you
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120]   so healthy.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   Right.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.960]   And so it's sort of following the money.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.640]   And I think the system's so big now that I mean, there's not one mastermind behind it.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.840]   It's just sort of companies acting rationally in the system in which that exists.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.120]   But I mean, I'm not trying to change society.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.240]   I'm just trying to make my life better.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   Exactly.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.160]   Which is, you know, I talk about freedom in the book.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.520]   It's a concept Americans have championed for centuries.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.000]   But for me personally, you know, freedom is just having the ability to choose how I spend
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   my time.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Right.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.240]   And and I think, you know, both Ferris and Jacob on your show spoke about the sort of
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.360]   myth of just following your passion for 40 years.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.720]   And the example there, I think, is of someone who loves preparing a nice meal.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.240]   I love preparing a nice meal for a few people.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.120]   And there's a big difference between that and going into a massive kitchen, preparing
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.560]   400 nice meals for 40 years.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   Massively.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.880]   And so that's why I talk about, I guess, going to the book that sort of slightly outrageous
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.680]   assertion that anyone can retire immediately and radically.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   And I guess that's to challenge in the way Jacob and Tim have challenged.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.800]   But for me, it's about assessing your situation.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.880]   And I was sort of approaching middle age.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.000]   I had some assets, but not an enormous amount of assets.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.240]   I had a great big brain, which a lot of us have.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.400]   And surely it could do more than just this.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.520]   And I think it's just about stopping work, taking a really hard, good look at yourself,
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.120]   including you might, for example, have a home with some equity in the home.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.720]   At the moment, it's not doing anything.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.800]   It's sitting there in the house.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.400]   The thought of not having a house or your house, it can drive people crazy.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   But I've got to say, I've moved out of mine and I'm now renting it out, which helps deal
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.600]   with that sort of debt, if there's any debt.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.440]   And it provides an income source that might let you kickstart yourself in this new, amazing
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   life.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.600]   Spending your time doing things that you find fun.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.320]   And I guess this is where I'm a little bit different to Tim.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.280]   Tim talks about creating a muse.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.360]   He says, I'm proceeding on the assumption that the best business is the one that takes
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.760]   the shortest amount of time.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.800]   And then so he proceeds on seeing a niche, minimizing it, outsourcing it, getting cash
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.280]   flow in from it.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.160]   That's his sort of model, which he doesn't talk a lot about, even though that's the hardest
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.840]   bit, I think, in what he discusses.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.120]   I sort of think if you become as efficient as possible, sort of radically, even if--
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   and it helps if you've got a partner.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.520]   You and your partner live in a tent somewhere by the beach.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520]   That's fantastic.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   It costs you almost nothing.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.720]   And so you become as efficient as possible.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   Maybe you're getting vegetables from somewhere, you've ticked all the boxes.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.120]   I mean, straight away, your happiness, particularly if you've stopped going into some sort of
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.240]   grudgery or hellhole, your happiness is about a million times more.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.680]   And that in itself is such a powerful thing.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.800]   Because when I was the partner of the firm doing this, doing that, the thought of living
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   in a tent, what?
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   It's crazy.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:35.320]   At the moment, we've just spent the last eight months sort of in a small RV type car traveling
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   around Australia.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.400]   And I've got to tell you, it's been the happiest time of my life.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:45.780]   And it's so far removed from the fancy alcohol and the fancy house and the big law business
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780]   and so on.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.320]   And yet, it's so much more pleasurable.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.080]   But going back to what I was saying, you become as efficient as you can cost-wise, which gives
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.160]   you options.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.320]   And then I think you look for-- you do what you want to do.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.120]   My sister's into llamas.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.440]   I've had interest in children's books.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.760]   I did some crazy children's books.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.440]   I just wanted to do those things.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.800]   They're fun.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.960]   And then I think commercialization opportunities in whatever fun activity you engage in will
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   present themselves.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.560]   And I guess you'd be an example of that.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.160]   You've obviously got a real passion for this radical personal finance.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.040]   And no doubt, every day you wake up and go, this is fun.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.400]   I'm talking to all these cool people.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   It's radical.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   No one else is doing it.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.320]   And so if you do what's fun, I think commercialization opportunities will present themselves.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.880]   You take advantage of those opportunities.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.680]   But I guess rather than following your passion forever, you don't leverage up, assuming that
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.360]   that's always going to be there.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.240]   But commercialization opportunities will present themselves, preferably in a way that provides
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.000]   you with an ongoing passive income.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.120]   And then I think from time to time-- and for a lot of us, it might be every couple of years--
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   you change focus.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.360]   And again, we saw that with Jacob.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.380]   He went through, I guess as I'm going through now, this awareness and awakening on the ability
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.880]   to retire effectively from your career and do fun things.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.920]   And so he focused on that.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.040]   And now he's focusing on something else that takes his interest.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.320]   He's a quant trader or some sort of advanced mathematics in the stock exchange, which caused
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.040]   some people to say, oh, no.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.000]   He dubbed them the retirement police.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.600]   Retirement police said, you're not retired anymore.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   You're a hypocrite.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   But the guy was only 33.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.920]   He's not going to sit like a vegetable for 50 years, is he?
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.000]   Of course he's going to do things that he finds interesting.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.760]   And some of those things might provide him with cash.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.960]   And I think that's true of take llamas.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.040]   I was just helping my sister with her llama magazine.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   She's volunteered to be an editor.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.440]   And there's one fellow in there.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   And she pointed to him.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.920]   See, that guy, he was an engineer fixing planes, only about late 30s, 40, perhaps.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   And he'd had enough.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.360]   He'd somehow acquired this small little farm with llamas on it.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.340]   And he now takes people on little llama tours.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.520]   And so he's reduced his costs down to very little.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   And he loves llamas.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.080]   And he's taking people on a llama tour.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.600]   And I think that's an example of how commercialization opportunities present themselves.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.800]   It's such a world apart from the heavy-hitting career and having to go into the kitchen all
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.200]   day for 40 years.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.080]   And I'm sure he could also have a llama blog.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.200]   He could write little llama books.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.640]   And he's not trying to exploit people.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.120]   He's just following his passion and almost helping people if they're interested in llamas.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.640]   And a few bucks comes his way.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   He's efficient.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   It's enough to get by.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   And he's got a huge smile on his face.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.760]   And in a few years' time, it might be something else he's interested in.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.160]   People talk and write about their travel.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.240]   I mean, that's harder.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.640]   But I think whatever you're interested in, whatever your passion is, without trying all
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.160]   that hard, these commercialization activities will present themselves.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   And in taking advantage of them, you're actually providing something fun and interesting to
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.440]   other people because you're not being cynical about it.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   It is your passion.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.480]   You're really interested in it.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   You want to help people.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.960]   You want to give them a ride on a llama.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.840]   You want to tell them a funny story in a book.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   And it all works.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.120]   And it works in a way that means that you spend-- I mean, what is life but a series
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   of moments?
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.520]   And sort of every moment when you're pursuing something you're really interested in, in
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.760]   that moment, it's fun.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.400]   And it sounds almost childish.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:08.400]   But I've gone from this very serious, intense, competitive life in which cash was the measure
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400]   of success.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.880]   He's earning x hundred thousand dollars.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Oh, that bastard.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   And so on.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:20.120]   And now my life, it consists of a series of beautiful moments, really.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.920]   And cash is just a tool.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   It's a tool.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:29.000]   And I think if you had to look at the most important things in your life, like cash is
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   it even in the top 10?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.920]   Like if you look at your health, your relationships, enjoying nature, experiences, really, what's
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   cash?
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.480]   And I think a lot of older people, I mean, they don't talk about being young and being
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:49.440]   able to run down a beach or seduce a man or a woman for pleasure and have a relationship
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   and all that sort of stuff.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.120]   Because all that stuff is diminishing for them.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.960]   And so, of course, they want to reinforce that they're kings of the castle.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.880]   And the fact they're worth $10 million makes them very important and successful people.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.920]   But I make this point in the book.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.880]   I'm sure any one of them would give every cent of it up if they could be 20 again.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.760]   And enjoying their time in the sun with a group of friends and for their parents to
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   be alive.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.840]   And that's what life is, I think.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.800]   And the focus just on money.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.600]   I mean, you become-- it's not just try it.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.920]   Your life really is extremely limited if you spend all day just pursuing cash in the highest
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.680]   paying specialized industry.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.120]   And you might do it-- people talk about deferred gratification.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.720]   And look, you've got a big brain.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.000]   It's all about solving problems.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.160]   And I mentioned that as well, I think.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.680]   And Jacob has made this point.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.720]   If you look at-- if your goal is having this wonderful life, or treat that as the biggest
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:55.160]   problem for you to solve, putting everything on the table, most people save their brains
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   for their job.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   And you get the most successful analysts with-- it's just lives.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   What's going on?
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.720]   And I saw a comic, the paper a day or so, that was just that.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.920]   Some sort of management consultant.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   And we all know them.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920]   They're all around the world.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.360]   They haven't slept in six months.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.240]   And they're the biggest brains and advise the biggest companies.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.880]   And yet their lives are shit.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:22.400]   And the bloke who works at the fish and chip shop three nights a week, living on the coast
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.000]   and surfing every day, his life's a million times better with a relaxed girlfriend.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.960]   So if you treat your life as a problem to be solved using the same brainpower that you
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.120]   apply to your work, and put everything on the table, including the country you live
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:42.560]   in, what you do with your time all day, where you live, you can really make a difference.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.280]   And if you enjoy being free-- and most people are scared by the idea of it-- if you enjoy
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.080]   it-- and for me, it's a million times better than the drudgery-- if you enjoy it, then
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.840]   once you cross over, you'll do anything to stay there.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.720]   I don't know if that was your experience.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   No, absolutely.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:06.280]   I tell you, a month after I left the firm I was with, I was sitting at the breakfast
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.240]   table with my wife one day.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.680]   And I was just saying-- and I was telling her-- I said, I just realized that for my
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:18.440]   entire life, I don't think I have ever been free.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.480]   I think I now am experiencing the sensation of being free more than I ever have in the
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.440]   history of my life.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.680]   And it didn't have to do with my time.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.520]   For me, it had to do with my freedom of speech.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:39.920]   And I realized that throughout my entire lifetime-- and this is not some-- what's the term?
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   It's not-- it wasn't some hardcore crime that was foisted on me.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.120]   But I realized that throughout my entire lifetime, I really had never had freedom of speech and
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.920]   freedom to live and do what I wanted to do in this way.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.720]   When I was in high school, if I said the wrong thing or did the wrong thing, I'd be expelled
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   from high school.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.640]   When I was in college, if I said the wrong thing and did the wrong thing, I'd be expelled
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   from college.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.120]   After college, I worked for a corporate marketing company.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.320]   Then I needed to represent the company well.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.700]   Then after that, I started my financial planning firm.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:20.040]   And I had both the industry regulations under which I agreed to-- I voluntarily chose to
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:27.480]   abide-- and then also the rules, the corporate image of the company, and the internal regulations
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.640]   and rules.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.880]   So all of those things, however, limit what you're able to say and what you're able to
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   do.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:39.960]   And then combined with those things, the general peer pressure of my reference group.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.520]   If my reference group is other financial advisors or my clients or something like that, I have
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.680]   to live in such a way that is acceptable to them.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.400]   I don't have to live in that way, but I am societally accustomed to living in a way that's
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.720]   acceptable to other people.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:00.120]   And then it was after being away-- and I had a wonderful group of coworkers.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.000]   But after being away for a month, I forgot about what they cared about and got in touch
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.640]   with what I cared about.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:12.560]   And then also just the ability to say what I wanted to say and do what I wanted to do.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.380]   I could, in a moment, I could destroy this show by saying the wrong thing.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.860]   But that's my choice to do it.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.900]   And I have that choice and that prerogative.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.080]   And it's just a really freeing sensation.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.280]   And once you come out of it, you look back.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.880]   I mean, I told my wife, I said, "There is no chance.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.320]   Let me not be quite so extreme."
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.080]   I tell her, I mean, I could do anything if I need to do it.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:44.640]   And so if my family were hungry, I would go and do whatever needs to be done in order
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.560]   to make sure that my family is not hungry.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.480]   I mean, I have chosen to take on to myself responsibility.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.640]   And that's extremely important to me.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:00.280]   But in an idealized world, I would simply say, I'm not going to go back and take a corporate
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.680]   job just simply to fit someone else's agenda for me.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.560]   I would rather start a hot dog cart.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:14.320]   I would rather rent our house out and go and be a farm worker and live-- I just don't want
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   to live it.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.720]   I don't want to sit in rush hour traffic.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.240]   And I don't want to have this expensive food that has made me fat.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.640]   And I don't want to live it.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.920]   I would rather farm my backyard.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.800]   There's so many things that I would rather do.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.600]   And now, I mean, I've got ideals left and right.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.760]   I've got lists of things that are backup plans to the backup plans to the backup plans.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.200]   And the cool thing is, is that I'm excited about all the different potential options.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.160]   I don't have time to do them.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.640]   And I want to do them because they seem fun to me.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.520]   And I don't have time to do them all.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.040]   And I might make an observation, I guess, about one family.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.960]   And that is extremely important.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.000]   And as providers, you've got to get that right.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.560]   And that trumps everything.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:07.840]   But you also said, if they're hungry, I'll do whatever I have to do.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.400]   And that's where I think it is a powerful observation in the book, which, of course,
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.480]   others have made, is that we're living in a time now in which the essentials of human
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.520]   life are such, I guess, are provided for in such a way that we're living better now than
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.760]   any king lived in the past.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:31.120]   And I mentioned a YouTube clip that I saw where John Lennon was being interviewed, I
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.240]   think, in the '60s.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:39.400]   And the olden day voice said, only a beetle could have a television in his car.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.200]   And there was John Lennon sitting in the back of his car with this big old black and white
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   TV.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   And he was looking pretty pleased with himself.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.760]   I thought, jeez, they're the biggest rock band that's ever been.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.560]   And this guy's a millionaire many times over.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.560]   And what's he got?
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.880]   A big, stinking black and white TV in the back of his car.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   And the penny sort of dropped.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.480]   I've got in my pocket something that's 20 million times better than that TV.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.800]   And yet, I'd say it as a 17-year-old kid.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   And yet, we're greedy for more.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.080]   We're sort of richer.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.320]   The poorest of us in the lucky countries that we both live in, almost the poorest of us,
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:24.800]   at least the poorest of us that are contemplating an exit, have more stuff than the richest
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.480]   human really for the last 100,000 years.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:35.840]   And so if you want more than that, you've really got to query your motivation.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.760]   How can you not be happy with the baseline stuff that's pretty well available to everyone
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:46.740]   if that baseline stuff through science and advancement is far more than the richest person
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.080]   had even 20 years ago?
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.440]   I mean, 20 years ago, the richest man in the world didn't have access to the stuff that
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.440]   we have access to.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   They didn't have the medicine.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.600]   They didn't have the technology, the cars.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.240]   It's all-- we are the richest people in the world at any time except the current time.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.520]   And you want more?
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.520]   You want more?
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.960]   It's really got to be quite special for you to trade your precious life to get more than
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.080]   the richest person in the world 10 years ago.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.160]   And I guess that's about being grateful for what we have and recognizing the cold, hard
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:25.960]   fact that we, through base technology, just catching up with the everyday man, we have
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   more, more, more, more than the richest person in the world not that long ago.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.440]   And so for you to be thinking, I need more again, I mean, what does that say about you
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.440]   once you realize it?
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440]   Right.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:42.080]   So it's all these things combined, I guess, that enabled me to be the happiest I've ever
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.240]   been and earning the least that I've ever earned.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.760]   But my life is so wonderful compared to how it was before.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.120]   And I mean, I can't compare the earnings from the past to the earnings now.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:01.680]   But I think I was confused about what money was because you talk about your peer group
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.320]   setting standards and they try hanging out with lawyers for 20 years.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.360]   They're the most conservative bunch out there.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   And if you look at the envy they had between themselves, it's extraordinary.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.280]   And their whole life might be turning to custard.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.920]   But if they have the cash, they sort of strut around.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:21.920]   What does it mean?
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.880]   I mean, they look 50 at 30.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.480]   And Ferris talks about that in his book as well.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.200]   He talks about people being a cross between, his 30-year-old friends look like a cross
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.000]   between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers, I think he said.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   It's horrendous.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.640]   And I mean, the same as me.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:42.880]   I hung out with people who really were quite-- by any normal standard, they weren't ordinary
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   human beings.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.360]   I mean, the greed was insatiable with some of them.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.360]   And I mean, why?
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360]   What are they going to do with it?
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.360]   I mean, are they just going to die with it?
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.840]   Are they going to drink $1,000 bottles of wine?
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.640]   I mean, it's got to serve a purpose.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.960]   And the most important for me, important things for me, as I said, are health.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.000]   And you mentioned eating the food that makes you fat.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Well, again, being a professional service provider in the legal industry is similar.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.640]   You're professionally drinking twice a week.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.200]   You're going out to fancy lunches.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.320]   And in your own mind, I think we can all fall trap to wanting to be special in some way.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.200]   And you've got all this cash flow coming through.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   And everyone else is doing it.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.280]   Why not go to the fancy restaurant?
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.080]   And it's this sort of spiral into madness and poor health over time.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.800]   But health, surely it's your number one priority.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.280]   And people don't talk about it, really.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.880]   They just talk about cash.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.480]   But for some of us, I think a lot of people-- if you are overweight, the best thing you
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.880]   could do is take a year off, if nothing else.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.880]   Take a year off.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   Fix that.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   You'll be 50 times happier.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   Go back to your career.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.200]   And that's something else that I first read in Ferris's book.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.720]   But it's something I think is very true.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:54.600]   And that's that fear-setting exercise where you imagine the absolute worst thing that
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.720]   could happen to you if you take the plunge you're considering.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.640]   And then look at how difficult it would be to restore the position you're in at the moment.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:09.840]   And for most people, if it all went pear-shaped, if-- whereas people less capable than you
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.480]   have made this work, that if for whatever reason you got unlucky, it was all a terrible
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.680]   tragedy, how hard would it be for you to restore your current position?
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.280]   And in many cases, you just get another job.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.600]   It's not that hard.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:27.000]   And so that fear-setting exercise makes it-- it gives you confidence to take the plunge.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.440]   And I knew that whilst I wouldn't be able to jump straight away in the same money that
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.920]   I was on, which was high because I'd been in the industry for so long, I could certainly
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.840]   get an extremely well-paying job anywhere in the world if I wanted to.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.480]   And so what did I have to lose?
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.760]   It just turned out I had an enormous amount to gain.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.960]   And I think many of the listeners would as well.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:53.320]   And what's funny is I'll bet you either have found or will find that just simply by being
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:58.120]   off of the beaten track, you'll get exposed to opportunities you never would have known
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.480]   existed.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.680]   I've gotten exposed-- even in the four months that I've been doing this show, I've gotten
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.720]   exposed to a bunch of opportunities.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.800]   And I've had the choice, you know, at any one of them I could have said, "Yeah, I'll
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   take it."
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   But I haven't been interested because I've still got this crazy idea about the thing
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.240]   that I want to build, my contribution to the world.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:25.400]   And it's funny because it seems so scary until you take the step.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.800]   And then once you take the step, you're like, "Huh, that was it?
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   Wow, interesting."
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   And every day is wonderful compared to the past.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:39.200]   One favorite story I have on people who escaped was a baker in Sydney.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.360]   And baking is a pretty hard job, and you've got to get up really early, and you're not
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.960]   really paid a whole lot.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   And he started baking cakes on YouTube.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.960]   That's his job.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.960]   Really?
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.960]   Wow.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   He's a photographer, he's the cake guy on YouTube.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.400]   And I remember him saying, "Yeah, I feel a bit guilty because all my mates are getting
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.320]   up at 3 o'clock and they're off to the bakery."
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.520]   And his big hit that got in the media at that time is that he'd made a Spider-Man cake to
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.760]   coincide with the release of the Spider-Man movie.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   And I guess kids are into Spider-Man, and parents go to YouTube, look for a Spider-Man
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   cake, and there he is.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.920]   And the revenue from the advertising freed him from the bakery.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:21.320]   And he probably serves half the time, makes cakes, and he does whatever he wants to do.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.080]   And I think in terms of a process, when people, particularly if you've been really working
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.120]   hard for over a decade, there's definitely an unwind period.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.640]   And you might get sick, you might be scared, "What do I do?"
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   But then you go crazy.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:40.520]   I think you go crazy with travel, you go crazy with freedom, doing pretty well nothing, I
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.520]   think.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.520]   And you might have to recover mentally and physically.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.440]   It's almost like a recovery from burnout for a lot of people.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.120]   But ultimately, and again, Ferris talks about this filling the void, I think it's like,
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.480]   "I do want to give back.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.480]   I want to do something.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.320]   I'm a young, capable, intelligent person.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Of course I'm going to do something.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.440]   What's in the next project?"
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.920]   And the difference is the project is your project, and any pressure is pressure imposed
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   by you.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.240]   There's not people really assessing your work unless you're trying to sell it.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.840]   And the project needn't be for cash.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.000]   I think the first priority is the fun or the passion at that moment.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.920]   You follow that, and then these commercialization opportunities present themselves.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.760]   But you do end up filling your time with something.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.360]   I think it's human nature.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:30.680]   A lot of people, including Jacob and Tim, talk about the acquisition of skills as being
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   a really rewarding thing.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.120]   I know Jacob was big into sailing and woodworking.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:39.720]   And Tim is famous for his rapid learning.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:45.400]   And I think he's learned a million skills, including most recently, he obviously got
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   into investing.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.880]   I think he started hanging around very rich people and thought, "Oh, why don't I learn
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.840]   how to do angel investing?"
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.600]   But I think it'd be unfair to say he's just chasing a coin because he's acquired many
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   other skills.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:02.640]   And I think your skills and your dreams atrophy when you're locked in the specialized business,
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   except in that area.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:09.760]   I'm highly expert at commercial contracts and risk allocation and intellectual property
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   aspects of that as well.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:17.640]   But, geez, I'd much prefer to be able to make a bowl out of wood.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.320]   Doesn't mean I want to spend 40 years in a bowl factory, but I wouldn't mind spending
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.400]   a few months or a couple of years getting really good at that.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.760]   And then when you do get really good at something, you're into what they talk about as the flow,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.840]   being really immersed in the moment, enjoying your specialized skills, but only having the
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.680]   ability to learn another skill and another skill, particularly if you're living a long
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   life.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:44.360]   We're looking at a long life, hopefully, as part of lower stress and better health and
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   all the rest of it.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.960]   And so I think skill acquisition, pursuing projects, it's all there and you've got the
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.520]   time to do it.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.280]   And as I said, without being greedy or deliberate, commercialization opportunities will just
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   present themselves.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:03.440]   And the more efficient you are and the more skilled you are at living, the less you'll
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.640]   have to think about the commercialization opportunities.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:12.240]   And if you get really efficient at living, just doing fun things like making cakes or
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:19.080]   doing llama rides or writing crazy kids books, which is what I've done, the money coming
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.360]   in from that will see you through, particularly if, and again, if you don't have the kids,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.120]   the options are really open to almost like a camping lifestyle.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.360]   Sounds crazy, but it's really fun.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.240]   Traveling on a budget around the world, the geo-arbitrage, taking advantage of different
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   exchange rates.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.640]   I was recently in the north of Thailand and I know a lot of people talk about it, but
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.880]   I was up there sort of checking it out.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.480]   And it really is cheap up there.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:52.520]   Like for a couple of bucks a month, you can get not a bad unit or apartment to live in.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:55.720]   And the food is, street food's basically free.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.760]   And I'm sure there are many countries around the world where you can really take advantage
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   of cost of living.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   I know America, it's much cheaper to live in America than Australia.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:08.120]   Australia's got this mining boom going on and everyone thinks they're a millionaire
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:13.920]   now and we think we're getting rich by selling each other property, which I believe America
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.360]   played with in the mid 2000s.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.360]   And so for a lot of people from Brisbane, which is where I'm from, even though I've
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:28.440]   been traveling for a little while, Brisbane people, their societal sort of structure and
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:33.120]   commands is to get a government job almost, a government job or a mining job, and then
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:38.080]   buy a house that's worth half a million dollars or more, and then spend 30 years paying
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   it off.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   That's it.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.440]   And all their money goes into that and they have barbecues in their backyard.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.640]   That's the formula for those guys.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:55.760]   I know I'm looking at buying, my partner is looking at buying a house in Ireland because
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:02.840]   looking globally, and you can look globally, Irish houses there can be bought for under
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.840]   100,000.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.520]   So it makes sense, doesn't it?
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:10.600]   And I know there are lovely Irish cottages, they might be 50,000 euro, 60,000 euro.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:16.360]   Whereas here, the same lovely cottage would be half a million dollars or $600,000.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.680]   And so I think you're looking, like really thinking outside, so you don't have to just
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.520]   spend all your time in the little or big town that you've grown up in.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.240]   I mean, people live all over the world at salaries that are extremely small in some
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   cases.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:38.200]   And you just got to be aware, travel, look at opportunities, look at cost of living.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.040]   These Irish houses, Ireland suffered, they thought they got a bit too big for their boots
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:48.560]   and everyone was borrowing millions to buy property largely.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.440]   And then it all went bad, all their banks almost went broke, they had to be bailed out
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.840]   by the Europe.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.960]   No one's lending and now property is extremely cheap.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.920]   And so there's no reason why we can't buy there and live in Ireland for a while and
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.040]   have fun.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.800]   And then get an upswing, rent it out, I mean there are a million options.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:17.240]   And having the time and the mental freedom to think about it, gives you a solution other
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.400]   than just the 30 years of paying off that suburban home and having barbecues on the
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   weekend.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:30.680]   The ability to be efficient, as you call it, is such a massive game changer.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:35.600]   And that efficiency both in the amount of money that you need, and then the, maybe it's
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.120]   the same word, but I would say the ability to be flexible in your thinking allows you,
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:47.760]   if you're okay with a very potentially difficult situation, you may also have potentially a
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.920]   massively valuable situation, like a peak experience that you didn't get that you wouldn't
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.640]   have otherwise.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.480]   This flexibility of thought, I think is just one of the most valuable concepts that we
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.680]   don't often talk about.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:08.320]   I remember one time I went to, well two trips stand out, one time I went to Columbia and
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.600]   I didn't want to spend much money and I just kind of jumped on an airplane.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.320]   But I was totally cool with, I didn't have any reservations, I didn't know where I was
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.860]   going, I just decided I got a cheap plane ticket to go to Bogota and I flew into Bogota,
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:24.280]   but I was okay with just about anything, including sleeping on the airport floor.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.320]   Well I wound up finding an amazing hostel to stay in, then I asked the people at the
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.960]   hostel what I should do, they told me to go to another town, it's a town called Villa
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.080]   de Leyva, and I jumped on a bus and I went there, I didn't have any accommodations, I
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:41.480]   got there, I asked somebody, I wound up being shown to this amazing hostel and it's $11
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:48.040]   a night for a beautiful room in the mountains overlooking the hills and the mountains.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:54.280]   Now it was this amazing peak experience, but it was open to me because I was able to actually
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.720]   do it because I was okay with having a really disastrous experience.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.080]   I never had a disastrous experience, but I would have been completely fine with it.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:07.240]   But if I were requiring and said no matter what, I'm not willing to run the risk of not
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.160]   having a place to stay, so I've got to sit at home on the computer and I've got to sketch
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:16.280]   out like here I'm going to stay here, and that's $98 a night, I wouldn't have had the
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.200]   money to go at that point in time probably.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:25.280]   And that's the thing, I think a huge amount of pleasure can be obtained by having these
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.320]   adventures and by solving problems and you probably felt quite chuffed with yourself,
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   you still are.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.880]   Right, I still tell the stories, it was an awesome trip.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:41.760]   And that's how I've been living with my girlfriend for the last seven months, just driving around
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.660]   Australia like we didn't really have a plan and then just on a whim we flew to Thailand.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:50.480]   Every day we had no plan, it was what do we want to do, what do we want to do, and that's
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   freedom.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:58.720]   We almost were in the middle of a bushfire, a wildfire, one side of the road and the lights
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.680]   shine, it's a beautiful sunset, someone must be frying some food.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.240]   No, it was a bushfire coming to get us and driving off, but that's a wonderful story
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.240]   now.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   Right.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:14.880]   That's the thing, you can turn really just about any horrible experience, and I'm sure
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:21.640]   there are exceptions, but you can turn many really tough experiences into just kind of
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.160]   fun by just viewing it as an adventure.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.120]   And I'll give two simple examples.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.280]   When I was growing up, purely because he was an adventurous guy, Teddy Roosevelt in the
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.480]   United States was one of my favorite presidents.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.760]   Now, I didn't know anything about his politics at the time, now I'm not such a huge fan,
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.320]   but when I was a kid I just thought he was cool because he was a president who went to
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:48.000]   Africa and hunted lions, and he was leading the rough riders, he's kind of a folk hero
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.760]   in American history.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:56.000]   But the thing is, you think about him, sitting here, what was it, the 19th, 18th, a long
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.920]   time ago, I can't place the date off the top of my head, a long time ago he's sitting there
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:08.960]   in Africa, living in a tent, on a very basic cot, and eating food that's cooked over a
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.960]   fire somewhere.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:14.720]   Now, yes, he has a number of servants, he has a number of people that are serving him,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.320]   he's got plenty of money to do this, but what's he doing?
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   He's living in a tent, in a beautiful place, hunting lions every day.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:26.600]   Now question, that was what one of the richest, most powerful former presidents of the United
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.320]   States was able to do at that point in time.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.360]   If I wanted to go and have an adventure like that, A, I could go do it in Africa, and that
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.560]   wouldn't actually be that big of a deal, but I can also do that wherever I happen to be,
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.720]   whether that's in Australia or the United States or Brazil or wherever, I can go and
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:47.040]   I can buy a nice big fancy canvas wall tent, I can get a very comfortable cot, and even
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:53.320]   better, I can get a cooking stove that doesn't require me to start a fire from wood to cook
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.660]   on, for 10 or 15 bucks I can get a Coleman camp stove from the local Walmart, I can have
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:05.120]   an internet connection and stream Netflix while I'm lying in my comfortable, what's
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:12.600]   the foam stuff, tempur-pedic pad on my cot in a beautiful part of the world for free.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.840]   There's land all over the world that I can do it for free.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.640]   But in order to be able to do that, I would have to be able to cut the mental chains,
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.440]   and that's what's challenging.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   Yeah, and it's the very lifestyle I've been living the last seven or eight months,
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:32.240]   just that on the road thing, and it's never been easier, and with technology, you're able
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:40.280]   to continue to run your affairs back home and get access to entertainment and all that
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:47.240]   sort of stuff, it's never been easier, and indeed the radical immediate retirement book
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:53.160]   I wrote in the monkey mire, watching the dolphins swim up and down the beach.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:59:00.880]   You can get these little projects going even when living in that very simple way.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.480]   What's interesting psychologically, and I've thought a bit about this, is if you're thinking
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.640]   about taking the plunge, it's much easier to do it in a very different situation, and
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.040]   I think that goes to our conditioning, even if you're aware of it.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:18.480]   I'm perfectly happy living in a tent while I'm on this crazy adventure, but could I live
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.200]   in a tent in the suburb I grew up in under the bridge?
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.200]   Right.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.520]   That's a very different thing.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   It is.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:30.600]   It would do my head in, but if I was in a tent on the plains of Africa, it'd be amazing.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:36.720]   I think that's why travel frees you.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:43.440]   It changes those very strong restrictions that society places on you, and even from
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   your family, from your neighbors, from culture, from all your workmates.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:54.360]   My greatest fear, I must admit, would be me with a beard living in my car or in a tent
[00:59:54.360 --> 01:00:01.640]   or something, and then my old client or co-worker walks past and goes, "David, is that you?"
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   Right, exactly.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.000]   Isn't it amazing how deep those ties go?
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.120]   Or if I posted it on Facebook, "Here I am at the local bridge."
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   Right.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.120]   "Come on in, what's happened?"
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:20.640]   But if I posted the same picture from Africa or Sweden or Australia, I guess, for a minute,
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.400]   "Oh, look at that guy, I'm jealous."
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   Exactly.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400]   Here he is living his adventure.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   I've got to do the same thing.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:34.280]   I think at the start, anyway, it's much easier to travel, buy a ticket anywhere, go there,
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.800]   live a crazier life.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.920]   You might just find that some of it slips into your life back home.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.520]   It's been recommended by others before, but I think it's Ralph Potts and his Vagabonding
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.520]   Book.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   Yep, excellent book.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.360]   Beautiful expression on the joys of crazy adventures on the road.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.640]   I think he quotes a line from, is it Wall Street?
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.040]   And Martin Sheen or whoever the actor was, is saying, "Oh, I'm going to make my millions
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.800]   by the time I'm 30, and then I'm going to retire and ride across China with a bicycle."
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.320]   Or ride across China on a motorcycle.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.360]   And Potts says, "You could do that after working as a cleaner for two months."
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:23.480]   All this stuff's really open to anyone right now, and it can change the way you think because
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:32.000]   you are less at risk of being controlled by these societal and cultural norms that affect
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.600]   us all, even if we're aware of them.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.360]   I've been living in my car for seven and a half months, having the time of my life, absolutely.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.080]   But could I live in a car in my suburb that I grew up in?
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.560]   No, I wouldn't want to.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.400]   I wouldn't want to, even though I know it's silly.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.440]   But we're off to Ireland shortly.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.520]   I'd love to ride a bicycle across Europe in summer.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.280]   Can you imagine a more wonderful adventure?
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.080]   But I'm not going to live in my bike in Brisbane any time soon.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080]   Absolutely.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.640]   That's an excellent point.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.920]   Let's wind down with, I'd love for you to just simply, because we've talked a lot of
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.680]   philosophy and it's funny, this show, my bet is that this show will either strike someone
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:23.720]   as utterly ludicrous or it'll strike someone as an entirely radical concept that they love.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.320]   And I think it probably depends upon where they're at, because many people are perfectly
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.780]   content and I think legitimately so, perfectly content.
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.480]   They love their life, they love everything, they're thrilled with what they're doing.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.280]   And so a show like this would stand out to them saying like, "That's crazy.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.400]   How can you be that way?"
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:47.840]   But there are lots of people who are oftentimes stuck without, feelings trapped and don't
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.980]   have a lot of money, don't have $2 million sitting in the bank, haven't created a muse
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:03:03.320]   that pays them 8,000 a month so they can dance the tango in Buenos Aires and lease a Ferrari.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:09.400]   So this show can be a kind of a breath of fresh air to say, "Wow, I can do something."
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.320]   And it can meet people where they are.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.680]   What specifically over the last year and a half, what were the specific steps that you
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.520]   went through once you decided to do something?
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.120]   What did you do specifically and then how have you specifically filled, you mentioned
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.000]   traveling for the last eight months, but how have you paid, how much are you spending,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   things like that?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.920]   Yeah, well I think the first thing that I had to do was to clear my debt.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.680]   Like a lot of people, I had investments and you build wealth through property investment
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.080]   shares, that sort of thing.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:48.280]   And I cleared a lot of debt quite quickly and that was extremely liberating.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.480]   Did you sell stuff or did you sell investments or what did you do?
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:58.520]   I sold, well between my girlfriend and myself, we sold three houses.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.040]   And we just got rid of them.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.720]   And so it really was a massive change.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:09.000]   I think we're paying over $10,000 a month in interest.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.280]   And how can you do anything?
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.080]   What sort of crazy life could you lead if you need to come up with that cash plus the
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.080]   cost of living?
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.920]   You know, sort of let alone pay any of that debt down.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.040]   So yeah, we sold down and became debt free.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.820]   So that was a practical thing.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:33.520]   In terms of, I guess how I survived back when I was sort of transitioning, and this is,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.520]   if you don't want to sort of go feral from day one, there's no reason why you can't build
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.960]   up some of this stuff on the side.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:46.440]   And I, not for money because I had no intention of quitting, but for fun, I wrote children's
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.680]   books for, really for my nephews and nieces.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.760]   But I was also really fascinated by online contracting.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.800]   And I had read Tim Ferriss' book, I heard other people talk about elance.com, I know
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:06.300]   that you've used some contractors to set up your own activities.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.040]   And so I was just having complete fun.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.960]   I'd written these children's books and then through elance, I sourced a magnificent illustrator
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.600]   out of Indonesia, who was very cheap, and he did these wonderful illustrations.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.040]   I got an editor out of Canada, who, you know, a lot of people sort of get thrown on the
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.040]   scrap heap at around 50, particularly in the media.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.640]   And of course, they've got wonderful opportunities ahead of themselves.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.760]   And now through elance, they can sell their time in little niche spots.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:40.040]   And I got a very cheap editor, just to proofread my stuff.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:45.160]   And I got a layout expert from the Philippines, who spent all day working for a book company,
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.400]   laying out professionally, and then at night was freelancing, moonlighting.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.400]   And so I got this sort of crack team assembled extremely cheaply.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.960]   And I find the print on demand technology thing is completely mind blowing, along with
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   books.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.720]   And for those who aren't familiar with print on demand, I know in the 80s, I heard stories
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.440]   through my parents of people who had delusions of grandeur with self publishing and that
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.480]   go broke because they spent tens of thousands of dollars printing their books.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.360]   And of course, no one bought the books and they're sitting there in the garage, gathering
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360]   mold.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.000]   But now, with print on demand technology, someone orders the book, and then Amazon prints
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.480]   it and posts it.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.960]   So it's incredible.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:29.920]   And at the moment, at least once a day, a child around the world opens up a package
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   and has my book in it with all the pictures.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920]   How cool is that?
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.800]   They were extremely gratifying.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.960]   And I wasn't doing this for the cash.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.600]   I did it for nieces and nephews and to explore online contracting.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.000]   And I certainly didn't want commercial books.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.560]   I mean, they're sort of crazy, crazy books with the stuff I would have enjoyed when I
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.840]   was a kid, but probably would never have been published.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:54.680]   And then it occurred to me, I thought, what about all those kids out there who don't have
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.720]   books published in their language because they're not commercial?
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.040]   And we talk about the system, the system at the moment is making everyone speak English
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.880]   or French or one of the major languages.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:10.520]   But what about those kids who speak one of the Indonesian languages closer to us or any
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.520]   of these smaller languages that aren't commercial?
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:18.200]   I thought it was really sad that they'd never hear their mother reading to them a kid's
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200]   book.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.320]   And so I really went out to the internet and said, look, would anyone out there like to
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.520]   translate my book into your language?
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.680]   Even though it's not a commercial language, I'll get it up.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:34.600]   I'll pay for it to be up and I'll make it available if I can for free on YouTube with
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.880]   professional scrolling.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:42.080]   And I also put out a cry for professional voiceover people to read it.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.000]   With my thought was a little kid, assuming they had access to the internet, could sit
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.040]   there in Africa or wherever they are and listen to this story being read to them in their
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   own language.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.560]   And it may be the only book they've ever heard read to them in their own language for free.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.960]   And I was amazed by the response.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.240]   And this is just one of these projects you might do other than for cash.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.800]   And I ended up with about 130 people helping me.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.080]   I'm trying to be a partner at the same time, right?
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.480]   You know, pretty busy, busy practice and all the rest of it.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.280]   So I ended up hiring, you know, for not a lot of money, a fantastic project manager
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.480]   who was also an ex lawyer working out of Canada.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.240]   And so she managed these 130 effectively volunteers.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.840]   And there was this enormous project and there were voiceovers being read.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.760]   I had this Greek guy who was a celebrity doing it and many others.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:39.920]   And I ended up with over 150 books up on Amazon in all these different languages.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.720]   And every day, mainly in languages other than English, a child opens the book and they can
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.800]   buy it in the e-book.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.400]   And also in many cases where I've been able to get people to help with the reading, they're
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.680]   read for free on YouTube.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.800]   And so I do get a small income from those sales.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.480]   And I haven't recovered the money that I put in, but I spent that money when I had a job.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.720]   And so now I have a small bit of cash flow coming in and some losses to offset any tax
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.680]   problems for the next number of years.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.400]   I guess that's just an example.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:20.200]   One of my friends worked for a publisher and I said, you know, what would it take for you
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.960]   to publish someone's book in over 40 languages, which is where my book is.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.400]   And if you go to Wikipedia, the most translated books in the world are pretty well behind
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.560]   the list, which is crazy.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.560]   That's the internet.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.560]   Everything's changing.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.520]   And my books probably count all the languages would be in maybe 40, 45 languages.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.240]   I haven't really counted because I'm not keeping track, but it's an amazing feat.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.120]   And I said to him, how much would it cost?
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.400]   And could you do it?
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.680]   He said, mate, we just wouldn't even consider doing it.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   It would be impossible.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.560]   So here I am with I'm not really doing it.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   My project manager is handling it and all the rest of it.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:59.560]   I'm through the internet doing a project that a big publishing company couldn't do and wouldn't
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   do.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.040]   And that's just completely mind blowing.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:08.960]   And I deliberately went as uncommercial as possible, deliberately to get the outcome
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.360]   of children and be able to hear a book being read to them in their own language.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.600]   And yet I'm still getting an income from it, from, you know, not the YouTube stuff, but
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.280]   from people who want a hard copy and they buy it.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.360]   And geez, if I'd made it slightly more commercial, I'd be making more money, you know.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.960]   And so I think that just shows you can do anything.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   You really can do anything.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:35.120]   We're living in this amazing, incredible time where a person who's not even devoting much
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.200]   time to it can undertake projects that corporations can't undertake with traditional structures
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:45.720]   of employees and having to pay $5,000 for a translation or 10 and layout and printing
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   and distribution.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   It's all changed.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.000]   And the world's sort of 20 or 30 years behind, but you don't have to be.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.920]   So I get a little bit of money from that.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.160]   And also looking at commercialization opportunities.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.320]   I had all these fantastic and still do these fantastic people who can help me through eLance
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.520]   and I have long term relationships with them and we trust each other.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.840]   I thought, well, this is looking at the fairer side of things, the potential for a muse.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:16.240]   And so I set up an online publishing service really to let people take advantage of this
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.880]   amazing revolution in publishing.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.640]   Interalia publishing dot com is the name of that.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.400]   And you know, I with that again, I haven't really pushed me.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.400]   This is I haven't had to.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.040]   But I've got a few clients just from word of mouth really at work.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.520]   And that works still happening.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520]   I don't touch any of it.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.200]   I have incredibly gifted people doing it all.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.480]   And it's really is like a Tim Ferriss muse that one.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.680]   And so I you know, if I get involved at all, it might be to send an invoice.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.680]   But that that is often done by my helpers as well.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.440]   So I guess to answer it, I've got directing come in from from books, even though that
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.840]   was an on commercial project.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:03.280]   And you can read about that at David J. Downey dot com with the volunteering and all the
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.240]   books you can see a link to YouTube to.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.080]   And I've set up this muse, Interalia Publishing, and that brings in a small amount of income.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.940]   And I do have a small amount of income coming in from investments as well.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.400]   So that's where I am.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.720]   And I'm looking but I'm not rich by any means.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720]   But I think that's the point.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720]   You don't have to be.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.080]   And I see money as a very small part of my life.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.800]   And I'm not driven by money now.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.280]   I'm driven by experiences and just enjoying my relative youth.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.920]   I'm I'm 39, I was 38 when I pulled the pin.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.120]   You know, if I look at the next 12 months in a cash is the least of it.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.040]   I'm just going to have crazy adventures while I still can.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:52.160]   And with my with my partner and and why not spend this time doing fun, adventurous, outrageous
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   things.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   Now is the time.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   What a story.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   What an amazing world we live in.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   Absolutely.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   I mean, we're talking now by Skype.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:10.560]   You know, I found you through your tweets or Jacob got involved and we're talking free
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.560]   with for free.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.560]   Right.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560]   Incredible.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.640]   And I give an example in the book about an Australian prime minister, our most famous
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.720]   prime minister, Menzies, who's prime minister for 20 years or something like that.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:26.060]   And he was so intimidated by his first international phone call.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:30.040]   He planned it for weeks and then he didn't know what to say.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.760]   And it was because it was such an incredible thing.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.520]   You talk, he's talking to someone in England.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.520]   Imagine it.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.520]   You know, it used to take months by ship.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.080]   And this is just in the 60s, mind you.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.540]   And so, you know, we are more capable and more powerful and richer than Australia's
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.840]   most successful prime minister who who spent weeks planning for his extremely expensive
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.160]   call.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.320]   And that should blow your mind.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   It's amazing.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.980]   The world's full of this amazing technological advancement that if you're smart and we're
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.940]   all smart, everyone's smarter than they think, more capable than they think.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.220]   There's so many tools out there now.
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:08.420]   You just spend some time thinking about your options, you know, mimic other people just
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.260]   to have a crack, do something fun just to learn, learn how to do these things.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:18.740]   You know, really, there's amazing opportunities and going to university for six years and
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.060]   then spending 40 years on the treadmill is the least of it.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.060]   Right.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.420]   And there's really no excuse other than a mental issue.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.940]   I just look in today's world.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:37.060]   You can go and every one of us listening to this, I'm sure, has a public library that
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.700]   is relatively easily accessible.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:44.060]   And that public library has free internet connections, has free computers to use, can
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.900]   connect you with Elance, with email, with everything, with YouTube, with all of the
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:52.140]   things that you need to create something and can give you space to work for eight, you
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:55.380]   know, ten hours a day for as long as they are open.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:00.300]   Every single one of us lives in some kind of Western society where there's either, you
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:06.260]   know, guaranteed health insurance coverage for poor people or there's just simply organizations
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:10.420]   that will pay the bill if you get sick and you need help.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:17.860]   Every one of us lives in a society where either there are official programs built by the government
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:24.260]   to provide food for free for those who don't have the money and/or there are individuals
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.260]   who would be charitable.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.700]   I mean, if somebody came to me and they said, "I don't have any food, but I'm building this
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.100]   business," man, I'd give them all the food they need.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:37.540]   Plus, in all of our societies, you can get calories so cheaply you can live on a buck
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:41.140]   or two a day and get the calories that you need to live on.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.140]   It's not going to...
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.980]   Yeah, and look, if jobs are available, it might be you build something up on the side
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   or you work part time.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.300]   I mean, I remember I was working full time in the horror as I saw it and I was down the
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:56.500]   Gold Coast in Australia and there was this very chilled lady.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.020]   For some reason, I wasn't at work and she was just fishing in the river and she was
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:02.020]   just a young lady.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.020]   I said, "Oh, how have you managed this?"
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.660]   And she goes, "Oh, I just work part time at the fish and chip shop."
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:10.220]   Her life's better than mine.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:15.140]   If you just become more efficient, get interested in being efficient rather than seeing the
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.740]   beer spill out, then get a part time job one day a week.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.180]   You've got all the other days and you don't have to beg for food or anything.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.860]   You can pay for your food, learn how to cook.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.860]   It's fun.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:25.860]   And then you fish.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.860]   You fish, catch food.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.180]   I saw a guy with these two massive salmon.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.300]   I couldn't believe it.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.300]   And I don't know.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.300]   I assume it's in Australia.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.540]   It's the same, although I don't know this.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.580]   But in the US, we have a progressive income tax system.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.820]   The more you make, the more you pay.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.220]   So there's a very...
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.740]   There's a strong disincentive to make more money.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:50.620]   So once you pass that basic level of living a lifestyle that's enough for you, the reality
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:54.260]   is none of us get more time.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.820]   And money can always be replaced.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.460]   You can't replace time.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.220]   So think it through.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.220]   Nor youth.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.140]   Yeah, nor youth.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.140]   This is the next...
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:09.420]   Depending on how old your listener is, but assuming they're under 45 or under 50, now
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.420]   is the time.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.660]   Old age is horrific.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.540]   And there's plenty of time to be sitting around not able to do the things that you used to
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.540]   be able to do.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.820]   Don't waste this time.
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:25.900]   Now is the time to explore, to do crazy things, and to take risks.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.780]   I only disagree with you about that last point.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.880]   I don't think...
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.140]   If old age is horrific and I'm dreading it, then I'm not going to look forward to it.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.980]   I'm excited about growing older because I'm...
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.780]   It's just going to be better and better and better.
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.260]   And the key is, is that how can I build a life that I don't ever want to retire from,
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:46.380]   such that when I'm 100 years old, I'm still rocking and rolling.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.860]   One of my heroes was there was a doctor, I don't remember her name, but there was a doctor
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.180]   in Georgia in the United States here.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.740]   And she was a pediatrician.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:18:01.060]   She retired from active practice at, I think, 103, and she died at 114.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.620]   And she had an amazing story.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.940]   And you don't work at 103.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:11.180]   There are doctors who are stuck in the grind that you were stuck in, and those doctors
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.780]   need to get out at 38 like you did.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:19.100]   But there are also doctors who figured out a way to really enjoy their business and their
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.100]   life.
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.740]   You don't work till 103 if you don't really love doing it.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.020]   It's not about being idle, is it?
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.900]   It's about doing really what you want to do, knowing your options.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:29.900]   And she obviously...
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.220]   I mean, you must love that to be working that long.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.220]   Absolutely.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:36.460]   Well, David, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:37.460]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.260]   DavidJDowney.com.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.780]   And I couldn't...
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.460]   What was the first word before publishing?
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.460]   I couldn't get it.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.460]   Inter Alia.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.180]   It's a pretentious Latin from my legal side of it.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:49.500]   Inter Alia Publishing.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.420]   Inter Alia Publishing.com.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:56.300]   And then your book is on Kindle, and it's entitled Radical Immediate Retirement, right?
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300]   That's right.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.420]   And there will be a blog by the same entry.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.740]   There's nothing there now because I'm not going to madly try and sell anything to anyone
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.740]   who goes there.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.940]   But over time, I will be just posting my thoughts on things that interest me.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.940]   Very cool.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.940]   Well, I thank you for coming on.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.020]   I thank you for writing it.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:16.860]   I think this is properly radical, and I'm glad to share it with the audience.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.860]   Thanks for coming on today.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.860]   Thanks.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:22.180]   Thanks for the call.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.100]   A fun and challenging philosophy, eh?
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:32.500]   I find it's hard to argue with just the reality that he talks about in terms of a lot of the
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.180]   stuff being mental.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.700]   Once you're free mentally, once you're willing to take a different approach, a different
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.900]   lifestyle, then it just affects what you can do.
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.180]   So check out David's book.
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.180]   It's a good little book.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:48.340]   It's pretty short, but it's very good.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:54.740]   It's one of those kind of nice slaps in the face that's pretty cool that can be a transformative
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.740]   event.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.740]   Check out his websites.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.220]   All of his websites and everything, all of those are linked in the show notes.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:02.820]   So you can find his books, you can find his children's books, and check out the YouTube
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.180]   videos.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.980]   All of that stuff is in the show notes for today's show.
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.680]   That's it for today for Friday.
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.860]   Thank you all so much for being here.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:10.860]   I really appreciate it.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.860]   Next week is Thanksgiving Day week in the United States, and I think at this point I
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:19.540]   will do shows on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.540]   I'm not sure exactly which shows I will do.
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:27.020]   I have several interviews that I've recorded already, and I may release one or two of those,
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.220]   and I may do some other shows.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.540]   So check back next week, and you'll see I will be taking Thursday and Friday off, and
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.020]   then I'll be back with you on the 1st of December, which will be the following Monday.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.780]   I don't know.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.340]   I don't know whether to do a Thanksgiving show or not.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.740]   Sometimes those things are corny, or sometimes they're not.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.380]   I'll have to give that a little bit more thought and see if I can do something that is Thanksgiving
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.940]   themed but that ties in.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.980]   If it's just corny, I'll skip it.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.980]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:58.180]   If you like the show, we'd be thrilled if you'd check out the Irregular's Podcast.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.060]   It's my membership program.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:03.380]   This show is entirely listener supported.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.020]   That's the way that I pay my bills.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:08.020]   So if this has brought value to you, if you found a way that could save you a little bit
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.100]   of money, I'd be thrilled if you would support the show.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:15.300]   If you're interested in more details, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/membership, and
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.860]   you'll find the details there.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.060]   Incidentally, I'm still working on building that out.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.060]   I haven't been able to get any more benefits.
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:25.940]   Those of you who have signed up so far, it's been primarily for just basically to support
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.620]   the show from all of the audio content.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.980]   I've got all my list to do to start getting some additional benefits in there.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:35.900]   I really do mean for that to pay for itself more than anything else.
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:37.540]   So that's coming soon.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:38.540]   And that's for today.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.540]   Have a great weekend, everybody.

[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:39.040]   Your situation is unique, and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything

[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:48.100]   This show is not, and is not intended to be any form of financial advice.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:56.460]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:02.460]   trustworthy, and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:09.500]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.220]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:17.220]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.780]   and I make mistakes.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:23.380]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment so
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.580]   we can all learn together.
