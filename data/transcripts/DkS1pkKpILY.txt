[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.280]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.220]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.280]   Today, we're discussing alcohol,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.180]   one of the most commonly consumed substances
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.520]   on the planet Earth.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.220]   I should mention that both humans and non-human animals
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.680]   consume alcohol either for recreational purposes
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.760]   because they like the feeling that it gives them
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.460]   or for medicinal purposes
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.840]   or for other purposes that we'll discuss.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.520]   We are of course going to discuss the effects of alcohol
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.760]   on our biology,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.500]   ranging from its effects on individual cells,
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.880]   on organs and organ systems in our brain and body.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.680]   We are also going to discuss the effects
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.460]   of the effects of alcohol.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.960]   That is what being inebriated really does
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.440]   to our thinking and our behavior and how it does it.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.920]   And we are going to address what seems to be
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.900]   one of the more common questions out there,
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.200]   which is whether or not low to moderate amounts of drinking
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.360]   are better for our health
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.680]   than zero alcohol consumption at all.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.240]   And of course, we will talk about severe alcohol intake,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.560]   binge drinking.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.240]   We will also talk about hangover
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.060]   and what science says about ways
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.480]   to reduce the effects of hangover,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.440]   either by doing things that are inoculatory,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.080]   meaning before you drink or while you drink,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.640]   as well as things to do if you happen to have a hangover.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.560]   We will discuss some of the genetic differences
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.660]   for alcohol and alcoholism,
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.260]   and we will discuss alcohol consumption in young people
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.440]   and how that can be especially detrimental
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.520]   for reasons that I think are going to be quite surprising
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.360]   to most of you.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.260]   My goal is that by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.720]   you will have a thorough understanding
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.740]   of what alcohol does to your brain and body
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.080]   and that you will be able to make informed decisions
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.420]   as to whether or not you should be consuming
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.840]   zero, absolutely no alcohol,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080]   small to moderate amounts of alcohol.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.200]   And again, we'll define exactly what that means,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.960]   small to moderate amounts.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.080]   And if you or somebody else that you know
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.380]   is consuming excessive amounts of alcohol
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.520]   that are clearly detrimental to your health,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   some of the better routes and resources that you can use
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.200]   in order to remove that dependence and/or consumption.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.780]   I'd like to preface all of that by saying
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.320]   that today's discussion is really geared
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.340]   toward giving you information.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.340]   It is not about judging alcohol intake
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.960]   or lack of alcohol intake.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.740]   I just want you to be able to make
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.220]   the most informed decision about alcohol possible.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.120]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.440]   is now partnered with Momentus supplements.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.660]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.360]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.280]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.760]   outside of the United States.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.780]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.320]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.000]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.940]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.580]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.760]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   and that are supplied in dosages that allow you
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.940]   to build a supplementation protocol that's optimized
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.520]   for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.660]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.980]   from your protocol in a way that's really systematic
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.820]   and scientific.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.940]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.280]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.380]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.500]   There you'll see those supplements.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.980]   And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.680]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.620]   on a regular basis.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.180]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.860]   Before we get into today's content in detail,
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.200]   I just want to answer a commonly asked question
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.460]   about alcohol consumption and the brain.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.900]   And the question that so often comes up
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.900]   is whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol,
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.580]   so maybe one drink a day or one or two drinks a day
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.420]   kind of thing, whether or not that is bad for your brain,
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.600]   in particular, whether or not it causes degeneration
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.980]   of neurons or nerve cells.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.300]   Now, the reason that question comes up so often
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.440]   is because for many years it's been known
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.340]   that high levels of alcohol consumption,
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.380]   so 12 to 24 drinks per week or more,
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.060]   is certainly causing neurodegeneration,
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.920]   in particular of the so-called neocortex,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.780]   the outer layers of the brain
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.860]   that house associative memories,
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.140]   that house our ability to think and plan,
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.700]   that house our ability to regulate our more primitive drives
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.300]   according to context, et cetera.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.360]   So to make very clear, drinking a lot,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.780]   so having three or four drinks per night
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.660]   every night of the week is clearly bad for the brain.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.780]   A recent study, however, finally addressed the question
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.100]   of whether or not low to moderate amounts
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.840]   of alcohol consumption can cause brain degeneration.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.620]   The title of the study is Associations
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.040]   between Alcohol Consumption and Gray and White Matter Volumes
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.420]   in the UK Biobank, the United Kingdom Biobank.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.580]   First of all, gray matter are the neurons,
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.860]   it's the so-called cell bodies
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.740]   that house the genome of the cells, et cetera,
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.800]   and white matter is the connections, the fibers,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.780]   the so-called axons of neurons,
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.300]   and it's called white matter because that tissue
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.500]   is surrounded by a fatty tissue called myelin,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.260]   which allows nerve cells to communicate
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.580]   with each other very quickly.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   So what this study did is it looked at the brains,
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.480]   both the gray matter and the white matter,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.460]   of more than 30,000, indeed more than 35,000,
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.140]   generally healthy middle-aged and older adults
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.940]   in the United Kingdom who were drinking
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.480]   various amounts of alcohol.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.180]   What they found was that even for people
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.020]   that were drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.460]   so one or two drinks per day,
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.040]   there was evidence of thinning of the neocortex,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.820]   so loss of neurons in the neocortex and other brain regions.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.960]   And I don't say this in order to cause alarm,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.080]   I tell you this because they are important data,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.600]   because they reveal and indeed answer the question
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.920]   that has been burning for so long
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.340]   as to whether or not chronic alcohol intake
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.440]   can disrupt the brain,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.660]   even if the chronic intake is very low.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.500]   Now, we should talk about what the word chronic means,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.060]   because many people, when they hear the word chronic,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.980]   think high levels of whatever intake, okay?
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.900]   So they think five drinks a night or 10 drinks a night
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.940]   or people drinking every night.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.380]   Now, in this study, they looked at people who, on average,
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.020]   were drinking one or two drinks per night.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.340]   So that could be 14 drinks on the weekend,
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.820]   it could be one drink per night,
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.980]   it could be seven drinks on Friday.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.060]   In other words, on average, one or two drinks per night.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.120]   And I think many people out there are drinking
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.100]   somewhere between one and two drinks per night
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.900]   or day of the week on average,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.180]   so that would be seven to 14 drinks per week.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.500]   So this is an important study,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   because it says that if you're consuming
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.140]   even just seven glasses of wine across the week,
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.000]   it's likely that there is going to be some degeneration
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.160]   of your brain in response to that alcohol intake.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.960]   Although, as mentioned earlier,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.440]   we will talk about some of the things that can inoculate
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.300]   against some of that neuronal loss.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.440]   For those of you that are interested
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.060]   in reading the study in more detail,
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.360]   we've put a link to it in the show note captions.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.920]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.460]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.580]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.700]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.720]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.500]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Our first sponsor is Levels.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.040]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.900]   how different foods affect your health
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.980]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.420]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.260]   One of the most important features
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.500]   of our immediate feelings of wellbeing
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.300]   and our ability to focus and think and move and have energy,
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.700]   as well as our long-term health,
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.860]   are our blood glucose levels,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.420]   that is our blood sugar levels.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.060]   And that's because all the cells and tissues of our body,
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.000]   and especially neurons and nerve cells,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.360]   rely on glucose for fuel.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.220]   I realize some of you out there are ketogenic,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.740]   and yes, you can use ketones for fuel,
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.160]   but the vast majority of people
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.560]   are using glucose for fuel in their cells.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.820]   If you want to maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.400]   you want to keep that blood glucose steady,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.200]   and you don't want it ever to spike or to drop too much.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.760]   So you need to understand how different foods,
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.260]   and indeed how different activities
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.540]   impact your blood glucose.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.480]   I started using Levels about a year ago
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.460]   as a way to understand how different foods
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.300]   and exercise and supplements and combinations of food
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.660]   and exercise and even sequencing,
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.500]   like when I do what,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.140]   how that affects my blood glucose levels.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.900]   It's been tremendously informative.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.980]   It's completely reshaped when I exercise, how I exercise,
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.940]   when I eat relative to exercise, et cetera.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.760]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.140]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.700]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.340]   Again, that's levels.link/huberman.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.060]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.620]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.500]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.260]   I've talked many times on the podcast
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.780]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.000]   is the foundation of mental health, physical health,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.740]   and all forms of performance.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.420]   And one of the key variables in getting a great night's sleep
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.120]   is making sure that your sleeping environment
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   is the right temperature.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.240]   Indeed, your brain and body have to drop
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.280]   by one to three degrees in order to get into sleep
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.340]   and to stay in deep sleep throughout the night.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.380]   If your room is too hot or if you're running too warm,
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.220]   you will wake up.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.460]   In fact, that is why you wake up in the morning.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.500]   With Eight Sleep, you can adjust the temperature
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.980]   of your mattress and your overall sleeping environment
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.860]   and customize that to you.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.440]   I started using Eight Sleep some time ago
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.640]   and it's just been a total game changer.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.820]   I program mine so that there's a subtle drop
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.840]   in the temperature of my mattress
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.680]   at the beginning of the night
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.980]   and then it gets progressively cooler
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.800]   and then it heats up toward morning.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.660]   Even has this nice little vibrate feature.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.100]   So it wakes me up by vibrating the mattress a little bit.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.700]   And of course that mattress is warming
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.380]   and warming is the way that we wake up.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.700]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,

[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.420]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.700]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.520]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.980]   And they also have some unique characteristics.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.140]   The company was founded by two all American swimmers
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.580]   from Stanford and everything about Roka eyeglasses
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.700]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.740]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses can be worn while running
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.580]   or cycling.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.740]   If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.020]   and they're extremely lightweight.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.460]   In fact, most of the time I can't even remember
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.500]   that I'm wearing them.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.780]   I wear Roka eyeglasses when I read at night.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.100]   So I wear their readers and I wear sunglasses
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.680]   at various times throughout the day.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.720]   The great thing about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.080]   is that even though they were designed
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.020]   for athletic performance, they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.580]   So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.420]   that make people look like cyborgs in my opinion,
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.180]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are the sort
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.240]   that you could wear out to dinner,
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.420]   that you could wear to work.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.860]   They have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.040]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.420]   you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com

[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.340]   Let's talk about alcohol.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.740]   And let's just acknowledge that human beings
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.040]   have been consuming alcohol for thousands of years.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.520]   If you look at the archeological evidence from Mesopotamia,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.180]   you'll find that 5,000 years ago, people had wine vessels.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.340]   Or if you want to know when people first started
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.820]   distilling alcohol, much to people's surprise,
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.880]   that did not first take place in Ireland.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.120]   And that's not a joke about the Irish,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.720]   that you'll see a lot of claims online
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.620]   that the Irish were the first to distill alcohol,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.200]   but in fact, they were not.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.520]   It was the Chinese that were the first to distill alcohol
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.320]   and that took place in China in the first century.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.700]   Alcohol has been used for nutritional purposes.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.480]   So there are cultures that believe and indeed still believe
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.600]   that the calories in alcohol are useful.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.580]   Although later we'll talk about how alcohol calories
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.860]   are indeed empty calories
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.260]   and what an empty calorie really is, why it's called empty.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.480]   Alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.500]   because indeed it does kill bacteria.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.380]   And as you'll soon find out, the fact that it kills bacteria
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.700]   because that is absolutely true,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.520]   it also kills the good bacteria in your gut
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.720]   and the destruction of that good bacteria in your gut
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.040]   can lead to things like leaky gut syndrome
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.200]   and has all sorts of issues
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.560]   and there are ways to deal with those issues
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.800]   and we'll talk about those.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.860]   So alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.220]   It's been used to clean surfaces.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.760]   It's used in my laboratory in order to make up
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.700]   so-called reagents to do our experiments.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.560]   But most humans have been consuming alcohol
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.360]   in order to change their internal state,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.520]   in order to feel differently than they would otherwise.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.720]   That feeling of being drunk or inebriated
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   or tipsy or lightheaded is something that many, not all,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.480]   but many humans seem to enjoy and pursue
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.520]   even though typically it leads to a feeling
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.520]   of being less happy, less motivated, more stressed, et cetera
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.120]   when the alcohol wears off.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.180]   That's pretty incredible, right?
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.760]   I mean, we're talking about a substance
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.780]   that people have been highly motivated to pursue,
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.960]   that are still highly motivated to pursue,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.480]   to create and to consume, that they'll spend money on.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.920]   And that's despite the fact that it makes them feel good
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.480]   and then it makes them feel lousy.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   Now, some of you might be saying,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.420]   well, I drink, but I don't drink to excess
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.080]   and therefore I don't feel lousy.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.120]   I feel good when I drink and then it wears off
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.720]   and it allows me to get through my evening
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.880]   and then the next morning I'm ready to go.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.480]   Okay, that very well may be true, I believe those people.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.120]   And as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.720]   I'm not here to demonize alcohol in any way,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.680]   but I do want to point out what alcohol is
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.560]   and how it creates the effects that it does.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.400]   And then I want to talk about what those effects are
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.760]   when you engage in consuming alcohol,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.560]   even as often as one or two nights per week,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.760]   or let's say you're just somebody
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.360]   who has a drink or two on Friday,
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.740]   maybe a few more on Saturday,
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.240]   or maybe you're somebody who consumes all your alcohol
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.920]   one night per week or one night per month.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.380]   We'll talk about how that's affecting your biology.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.120]   So let's address what alcohol is
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.700]   and how it affects the cells and tissues
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.740]   and organs of your body.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.200]   Then we'll take a look at some of the epidemiology,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.240]   that is how many people are consuming alcohol
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.760]   and how much they're drinking.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.100]   And then you will be able, I think,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.560]   to get a good sense of how the alcohol that you're drinking,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.860]   if you're drinking any at all,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.480]   is impacting your brain and body
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.200]   and the choices you might want to make
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.760]   about how and when to drink alcohol,
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.160]   or even if you want to eliminate alcohol altogether.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   Okay, so some basic chemistry and biology of alcohol.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.720]   And again, I'll make this very clear,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.480]   even if you don't have a chemistry and biology background,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.800]   because of the structure of alcohol,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.860]   it is what's called both water soluble and fat soluble,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.540]   translated into what's meaningful for you.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.840]   What that means is when you drink alcohol,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.560]   it can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.920]   It has no trouble just passing right into those cells.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.860]   So unlike a lot of substances and drugs
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.080]   that actually attach to the surface of cells,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.360]   to receptors as they're called, little parking spots,
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.480]   and then trigger a bunch of downstreams,
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.840]   like domino cascades of effects,
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.720]   alcohol actually has its own direct effects on cells
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.460]   because it can really just pass into those cells.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.960]   So it's water and fat soluble.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.160]   And the fact that it can pass into so many organs and cells
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.440]   so easily is really what explains its damaging effects.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.040]   I should mention that there are three main types of alcohol.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.440]   There's isopropyl, methyl, and ethyl alcohol,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.560]   and only the last one, ethyl alcohol or ethanol,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.440]   is fit for human consumption.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.480]   However, it is still toxic, okay?
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.880]   It produces substantial stress and damage to cells.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.340]   I'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.900]   but that's just a fact.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.400]   Ethanol produces substantial damage to cells.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.720]   And it does that because when you ingest ethanol,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.520]   it has to be converted into something else
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.640]   because it is toxic to the body.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.100]   And there's a molecule inside of all of us called NAD.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.700]   And you may have heard of NAD because it's quite popular.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.140]   There's a lot of discussion about NAD
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.000]   in the longevity literature right now.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.680]   NAD is present in all our cells from birth until death.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.400]   The levels of NAD tend to go down across the lifespan.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.720]   There are ideas that increasing levels of NAD
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.740]   may extend lifespan.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.300]   A lot of that is still controversial,
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.880]   or at least we should say is ongoing
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.260]   in terms of the research.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.520]   But nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.160]   NAD and related biochemical pathways
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.440]   are involved in converting that ethanol
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.040]   into something called acetaldehyde.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.540]   It's broken down into acetaldehyde.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.120]   And if you thought ethanol was bad,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.920]   acetaldehyde is particularly bad.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.960]   Acetaldehyde is poison.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.040]   It will kill cells.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.640]   It damages and kills cells.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   And it is indiscriminate as to which cells
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.960]   it damages and kills.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.840]   Now, that's a problem, obviously.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.000]   And the body deals with that problem
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.400]   by using another component of the NAD biochemical pathway
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.680]   to convert acetaldehyde into something called acetate.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.960]   Acetate is actually something
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.220]   that your body can use as fuel.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.440]   And that process of going from ethanol
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.200]   to acetaldehyde to acetate
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.400]   does involve the production of a toxic molecule, right?
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.600]   Again, acetaldehyde is really toxic.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.080]   And NAD, and if we want to get technical,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.480]   it's the NAD to NADH ratio.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.460]   And that chemical step is the rate limiting step
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.680]   to ethanol's metabolism.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.180]   What does that mean for you?
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.460]   What that means is that if your body
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.400]   can't do this conversion of ethanol
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.180]   to acetaldehyde to acetate fast enough,
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.540]   well, acetaldehyde will build up in your body
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.180]   and cause more damage.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.320]   So it's important that your body be able
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.840]   to do this conversion very quickly.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.160]   And the place where it does that is within the liver.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.760]   And cells within the liver are very good
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.640]   at this conversion process,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.960]   but they are cells and they are exposed to the acetaldehyde
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.600]   in the conversion process.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.160]   And so cells within the liver really take a beating
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.440]   in the alcohol metabolism events.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.480]   So the key thing to understand here is that
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.380]   when you ingest alcohol, you are, yes, ingesting a poison.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.760]   And that poison is converted
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.460]   into an even worse poison in your body.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.440]   And some percentage of that worst poison
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.260]   is converted into a form of calories that you can use
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.200]   to generate energy, generate ATP.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.480]   And the reason why alcohol is considered empty calories
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.740]   is because that entire process is very metabolically costly,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.080]   but there's no real nutritive value
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.360]   of the calories that it creates.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.280]   You can use it for immediate energy,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.600]   but it can't be stored
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.800]   in any kind of meaningful or beneficial way.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.440]   It doesn't provide any vitamins.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.120]   It doesn't provide any amino acids.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.000]   It doesn't provide any fatty acids.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.880]   It's truly empty calories.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.960]   I know some people talk about sugar is empty calories,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.640]   but sugar actually is a far better fuel source
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.160]   than alcohol or acetate.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.100]   But nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.240]   some percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.660]   and some is being shuttled into a fuel source.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.400]   Now, the important thing to understand
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.260]   is that it is the poison, the acetaldehyde itself,
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.760]   that leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.080]   I think most people don't realize that,
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.400]   that being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.320]   in the way that your neural circuits work.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.400]   And so we should ask ourselves which neural circuits,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.800]   what brain areas, what body areas involved
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.740]   in feeling drunk or inebriated.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.560]   Now, in thinking about this state of being tipsy or happy
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.440]   or really drunk or a little bit drunk,
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.660]   I want to mention something
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.920]   I think most people aren't aware of.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.040]   And that's the fact that for people
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.680]   that are regular drinkers
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.900]   or that have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism,
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.240]   when they drink, they tend to feel very energized
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.540]   and very good for longer periods of time.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.080]   Again, people have a genetic predisposition to alcohol
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.520]   or people who are chronic drinkers,
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.200]   or even just, if you recall,
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.460]   chronic doesn't have to mean a ton of alcohol,
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.080]   but they're drinking one or two per night
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.880]   or they're every other night type drinkers
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.640]   or Thursday through Sunday drinkers.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.840]   Those people typically experience an increase
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.000]   in alertness and mood when they drink,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.640]   whereas occasional drinkers will have a briefer,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.900]   meaning less long lasting,
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.800]   period of feeling good when they drink
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.620]   and then more quickly transition into a state
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.440]   in which they're tired or they start losing motor skills,
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.080]   they start slurring their speech.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.620]   I also want to emphasize this is distinct from tolerance.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.800]   We'll talk about tolerance later
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.520]   and exactly what tolerance means.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.900]   But I really want to highlight the fact
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.960]   that when people ingest this poison,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.080]   'cause indeed it is poison,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.040]   the range of effects is very different
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.120]   and you can reliably predict who are the people
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.400]   with a predisposition to alcoholism
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.240]   and who are the people who are more regular drinkers
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.480]   by the contour, the timing of the different effects.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.800]   And again, people who tend to feel more alert and excited
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.560]   every time they drink, they tend to get a real lift.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.000]   They become kind of the life of the party
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.320]   and that lasts a long while.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.040]   Those people are the ones that really have to be careful
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.080]   about predisposition for alcoholism.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.620]   And those people also need to be careful
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.000]   about their drinking and the amount of drinking
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.420]   that they're doing, even if they're not full blown alcoholics.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.800]   Now, of course, people who are ingesting alcohol,
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.120]   who are not accustomed to drinking alcohol
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.560]   have to be concerned about drinking alcohol for other reasons
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.680]   because it can impair motor function and judgment, et cetera.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.800]   But in thinking about the biochemical effects of alcohol
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.600]   and what it's doing to the body,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   what it's doing in all cases is it's consumed into the gut,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.840]   goes into the stomach,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.700]   the liver immediately starts this conversion
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.640]   that we talked about before
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.880]   of ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.040]   And some amount of acetaldehyde and acetate
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.180]   are making it into the brain.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.660]   It crosses the blood-brain barrier.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.580]   Again, the brain has this fence around it
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.120]   that we call the blood-brain barrier or the BBB.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.640]   Many things, most things thankfully,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.800]   can't pass across the blood-brain barrier,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.040]   but alcohol because it's water and fat soluble
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   just cruises right across this fence
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.220]   and into the milieu, the environment of the brain,
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.340]   which is made up of a couple of different major cell types,
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.640]   neurons, nerve cells, and so-called glial cells,
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   which are in between the nerve cells.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   And we'll talk about the effects on each of those soon.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.560]   So what happens when alcohol gets into the brain
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.100]   that makes us feel tipsy or drunk
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.980]   and in some people makes people feel really,
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.040]   especially energized and happy?
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.900]   Well, alcohol is indiscriminate
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.540]   in terms of which brain areas it goes to.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.980]   Again, it doesn't bind to particular receptors,
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.920]   but it does seem to have a propensity or an affinity
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.560]   for particular brain areas that are involved
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.280]   in certain kinds of thinking and behavior.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.400]   So one of the first things that happens
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.200]   is that there's a slight,
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.100]   at least after the first drink or second drink,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.600]   there's a slight suppression in the activity of neurons
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.980]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.240]   This is an area of your neocortex
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.300]   that's involved in thinking and planning
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   and perhaps above all in suppression of impulsive behavior.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.400]   So if you go to a party and they're serving alcohol
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.980]   and people are consuming drinks,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.960]   what you'll notice is that a few minutes into that party,
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.240]   the volume of people's voices will increase.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.440]   And that's because people are simply not paying attention
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.680]   to their voice modulation.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.400]   As other people start speaking more loudly,
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.640]   other people are speaking more loudly.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.560]   We've all had this experience, right, of going to a party
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.360]   and then you step outside for a moment and you go,
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.680]   "Oh my goodness, I was shouting."
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.400]   You come home the next day, you got a sore throat.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.200]   It might be that you picked up some sort of bug,
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.600]   some virus or something.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.520]   But oftentimes it's just the fact
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.080]   you've been shouting all night just to be heard
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.500]   because as the prefrontal cortex shuts down,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.060]   people stop modulating their level of speech quite as much.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.420]   Also notice that people start gesticulating more.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.760]   People will start standing up and sitting down more.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.860]   They'll start walking around more.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.700]   If there's music on,
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.000]   people might spontaneously start dancing.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.160]   All of this is because these areas of the prefrontal cortex
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.000]   normally are providing what's called top-down inhibition.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.160]   They are releasing a neurotransmitter called GABA
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.800]   onto various parts of the brain.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.680]   They're involved in impulsive motor behavior
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.920]   and thought patterns.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.040]   And as you shut down the prefrontal cortex,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.440]   that GABAergic suppression of impulses starts to be released.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.400]   So people will say things that they want to say
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.360]   without so much forethought about what they're saying.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.800]   Or they might do things that they want to do
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.880]   without really thinking it through quite as much
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.280]   or they might not even remember thinking it through at all
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.260]   or experience, I should say, thinking it through at all.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.680]   We haven't talked about blacking out yet
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.560]   in the effects of alcohol on memory.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.520]   But as long as we're there,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.600]   I'll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.280]   in suppressing the neural networks
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.160]   that are involved in memory formation and storage.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.000]   This is why oftentimes we forget the events of a night out
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.780]   if we've been drinking.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.520]   One of the more important things to know
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.000]   about the effects of alcohol in the brain
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.840]   is this disruption in top-down inhibition,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.820]   but also that areas of the brain
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.680]   that are involved in flexible behavior,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.200]   sort of considering different options,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.640]   like I could do A or I could do B.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.480]   I could say this to them or I could say that.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.600]   I could say it in that way
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.600]   or I could say it in this way.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.560]   This might be a little more tactful.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.680]   Those brain areas basically shut down entirely
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.840]   and people just tend to say what they want to say.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.560]   So the key thing to understand is that when people drink,
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.160]   the prefrontal cortex and top-down inhibition is diminished.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.280]   That is habitual behavior
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.100]   and impulsive behavior starts to increase.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.180]   Now, what's interesting is this is true in the short term,
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.640]   so after people have one or two,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.260]   maybe three or four drinks,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.040]   but it's also true that the more often that people drink,
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.540]   there are changes in the very circuits
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.500]   that underlie habitual and impulsive behavior.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.160]   Okay, this is really important to highlight,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.480]   so much so that I want to drill into it
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.760]   a little bit more deeply.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.700]   For the person that drinks, say, every Thursday night
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.800]   or every Friday night,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.260]   or goes out only on Saturdays, but every Saturday,
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.140]   there's evidence that there are changes
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.740]   in the neural circuits of the brain
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.800]   that control habitual behavior and impulsive behavior,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.540]   and they are modified and strengthened
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.280]   in ways that make those people more habitual
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.080]   and more impulsive outside the times
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.700]   in which they are drinking.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.040]   And when they drink, impulsive and habitual behavior
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.800]   tends to increase even further.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.120]   This is something that's not often talked about
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.840]   when discussing the effects of alcohol.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.120]   And we all know the effects of being drunk can be bad,
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.360]   can be bad in terms of judgment, motor coordination,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.680]   certainly driving drunk is a terrible thing,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.600]   get you or other people killed, and so on.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.640]   But rarely do we hear about the changes in neural circuits
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.440]   from just one or two nights of regular drinking.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.120]   Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily mean
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.600]   every day and every night.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.300]   It could be the person that simply drinks
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.580]   every Thursday or every Friday,
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.220]   or just once a week has three or four drinks,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.000]   or maybe even a few more.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.960]   That person is going to experience
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.600]   a decrease in this top-down inhibition,
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.880]   so an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.840]   because the break on those behaviors
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.720]   has been removed while they're drinking,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.360]   but also changes in the very neural circuits
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.000]   that allow habitual and impulsive behavior
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.480]   to occur more readily even when they're not drinking.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.680]   And if you want to know the actual substrate for that,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.640]   the cellar substrate, I can briefly describe it.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.040]   It's really interesting.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.340]   Again, you don't need to know any biology
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.240]   to understand this.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.000]   What it does is it increases the number of synapses,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.300]   the actual points of connection in the neural circuits
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.780]   that control habitual behavior.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.580]   So there's literally a growth of the neural circuits
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.820]   in your brain that lead to existing habit execution, right?
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.180]   The performance of things you already know how to do
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.760]   and a reduction in the neural circuits,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.100]   or I should say a reduction in the number of synapses
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.720]   of the contacts within the neural circuits
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.540]   that are controlling behavior.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.000]   So this again is a not often discussed aspect
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.140]   of alcohol intake.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.200]   Fortunately, it is reversible.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.460]   So in animals or humans that undertake a period of abstinence
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.920]   of anywhere from two to six months,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.260]   these neural circuits return to normal,
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.140]   except in cases where people have been chronically drinking
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.280]   large volumes of alcohol for many, many years.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.540]   And in those cases,
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.840]   while there is some recovery of brain circuitry,
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.100]   after people get sober, meaning completely sober,
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.980]   they stop drinking entirely,
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.580]   there is evidence of long lasting impact
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.240]   of heavy alcohol usage throughout the lifespan.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.860]   But of course, this doesn't mean that anyone
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.780]   that's suffering from alcoholism or that used to
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.880]   should not continue to focus on their health.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.280]   You absolutely should, all is not lost.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.980]   But for people that have been drinking for a lot of years,
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.520]   maybe you went to college and you drank a lot in those years
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.380]   and your neural circuits change.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.820]   If there's a period in which you don't drink alcohol,
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.580]   again, from two to six months and ideally longer,
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.660]   those neural circuits can then be re-modified
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.260]   back to their original state.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.740]   So let's consider some of the other neurochemical effects
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.340]   of alcohol in the brain and body.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.580]   And again, for right now, we're confining the conversation
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.560]   to people that are drinking on average,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.300]   one or two drinks per night.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.920]   Now, some people might think that two drinks per night
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.380]   is a lot and a lot of that will depend on body weight.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.380]   So for instance, people who weigh 110 pounds,
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.340]   for them to ingest two alcoholic drinks
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.820]   is going to be substantially different
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.580]   in terms of the biochemical effects
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.260]   than somebody who weighs 220 pounds.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.840]   Of course, tolerance will also factor into this,
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.480]   genetic background will also factor into this,
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.100]   and indeed, whether or not people have eaten
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.940]   will factor into this.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.000]   So there are a lot of factors and we'll talk about that.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.440]   For the time being, if you're curious about how food impacts
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.360]   the effects of alcohol and your feelings of being drunk,
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.560]   you may have heard, for instance,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.020]   that if somebody is inebriated and they want to sober up,
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.080]   they should eat something, turns out that does not work.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.100]   Here's how it does work, however.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.280]   If you eat something prior to drinking alcohol
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.800]   or while ingesting alcohol,
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.700]   it will slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.020]   In other words, you won't feel as drunk as fast.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.220]   For many of you, this probably comes as no surprise,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.460]   in particular, if that meal includes carbohydrates,
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.660]   fats, and proteins, okay?
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.800]   The inclusion of all three major macronutrients
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.620]   seems to slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.520]   far more than having any one of those
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.220]   or two of those macronutrients present.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.700]   Now, if you are already inebriated
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.840]   or you've had a glass of wine or a beer
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.880]   and you eat something,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.960]   chances are that alcohol has already made it
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.780]   into your bloodstream
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.940]   because it moves into the bloodstream so quickly.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.060]   Again, it's fat soluble and water soluble,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.360]   so within minutes, right?
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.000]   If you have an empty stomach,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.560]   within five to 10 minutes,
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.320]   that alcohol is going to be within your bloodstream
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.360]   and distributed throughout your body,
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.640]   maybe even faster depending on the type of alcohol
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.600]   and your metabolism.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.240]   But if you're already drunk and you eat something,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.780]   it's not going to sober you up more quickly,
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.080]   but it certainly will blunt the effects
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.900]   of any additional alcohol that you might consume.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.440]   And if you're somebody who is concerned
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.160]   about getting too drunk too quick,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.380]   even from a small amount of alcohol,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.860]   having some food in your gut can certainly be beneficial.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.260]   Now, that's food and alcohol and the absorption of alcohol,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.340]   but let's go back to talking about the biochemical
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.900]   and neurochemical effects of alcohol on the brain.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.960]   We talked about top-down inhibition
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.400]   and we talked about habitual
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.820]   and impulsive behavior circuitry.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.860]   There are also dramatic changes in the activity of neurons
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.040]   that control the release of so-called serotonin.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.060]   Serotonin is a neuromodulator.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.860]   It changes the activity of neural circuits
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.540]   and many neural circuits, in particular,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.460]   those involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.980]   Recently, there's been a lot of interest in serotonin
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.300]   because of a study that was released
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.840]   that showed pretty conclusively
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.700]   that serotonin levels can't really explain depression
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.280]   and depression-like symptoms.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.460]   I want to make it very clear
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.100]   that although that study did show that serotonin levels
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.340]   are not necessarily associated with depression,
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.580]   the study was interpreted by many to mean
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.540]   that SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.540]   which have the net effect of increasing serotonin,
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.200]   these are things like Prozac, et cetera,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.440]   that those drugs are somehow not helpful
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.060]   because they increase serotonin
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.980]   and serotonin isn't involved in depression.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.320]   That logic doesn't really hold together,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.720]   so I'm going to use this as an opportunity
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.380]   to just clarify what really occurred there,
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.020]   and then we'll talk about how serotonin
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.300]   relates to alcohol consumption
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.100]   in things like feeling good and in depression.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.580]   The key thing is this,
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.860]   SSRIs can help alleviate depression.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.820]   That's right, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.080]   They are often not always associated with side effects,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.320]   dosage is very important, et cetera,
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.120]   but they probably support relief from depression
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.840]   by changing neural circuits,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.100]   not necessarily by increasing serotonin itself.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.440]   That is, increasing serotonin with these drugs
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.500]   likely change the neural circuits involved in mood,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.820]   allowing people to feel better
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.420]   through so-called neuroplasticity,
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.540]   which is the brain's ability to change itself
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.860]   in response to experience.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.900]   So there's a bit of confusion,
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.800]   and again, I'm using this episode on alcohol
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.980]   to highlight some of the confusion
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.300]   because I think it's timely,
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.260]   because the study just came out
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.260]   and there's a lot of chatter about this out there,
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.700]   that when people are depressed,
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.820]   it's not necessarily because serotonin levels are low.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.160]   However, if serotonin levels are increased
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.080]   with things like Prozac, Zoloft, and other SSRIs,
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.800]   oftentimes there is, yes, a relief from depression,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.260]   but that's probably not
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.500]   because of restoring serotonin levels per se,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.380]   it's probably because serotonin facilitates
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.540]   the changes in neural circuits that need to occur
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.300]   in order for people to feel elevated mood, okay?
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.020]   So again, that's a bit of a tangent and a sigh,
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.700]   but I do think it's a vital one for people to know about.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.540]   Again, if you're thinking about taking SSRIs,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.820]   you're currently taking them and you've heard this news,
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.300]   definitely talk to your doctor.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.660]   Again, there is great utility for some of these SSRIs,
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.740]   and also in conditions like OCD,
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.360]   they've been shown to be very beneficial,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.580]   so we really don't want to throw SSRIs out
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.380]   as a potentially valuable treatment.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:05.000]   Getting back to the effects of alcohol on serotonin,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.560]   it's very clear beyond any doubt
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.320]   that many of the circuits in the brain
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.800]   that are involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.120]   and also sort of self-image in how we see ourselves
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.040]   employ the neuromodulator serotonin and alcohol
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.520]   when we ingest it and it's converted into acetaldehyde,
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.640]   it goes and that acetaldehyde acts as a toxin
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.080]   at the very synapses,
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   the connections between the serotonergic neurons
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.440]   and lots of other neurons.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.400]   In other words, when we ingest alcohol,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.220]   the toxic effects of alcohol disrupt those mood circuitries
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.860]   at first making them hyperactive,
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.260]   that's right, making them hyperactive,
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.260]   this is why people become really talkative,
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.380]   people start to feel really good
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.140]   after a few sips of alcohol, at least most people do,
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.060]   and then as they can ingest more alcohol
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.940]   or as that alcohol wears off,
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.620]   serotonin levels and the activity of those circuits
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.940]   really starts to drop and that's why people feel less good.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.360]   And typically what they do, they go and get another drink
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.660]   and they attempt to kind of restore that feeling
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.860]   of wellbeing and mood.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.980]   Now, typically what happens
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.900]   is that as people ingest the third and fourth,
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.920]   maybe even the fifth drink,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.980]   there's an absolute zero chance of them recovering
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.700]   that energized mood, right?
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.580]   Most people as they drink more and more
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.280]   will now start to feel more and more suppressed.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.500]   The forebrain is now shutting down quite a lot,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.460]   a lot of the motor cortical areas
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.580]   that control coordinated movement
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.000]   and deliberate movement start to shut down,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.980]   so people start to slur their speech,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.740]   people start to shuffle their feet,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.660]   people forget their posture,
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.020]   people start to lean on things,
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.140]   people start passing out on couches.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.660]   There's a great depression,
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.960]   not depression of the psychiatric depression sort,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   but a depression of alertness and arousal
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.020]   and eventually people will pass out.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.460]   Now, I said most people
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.320]   because there's a subset of people that have gene variants
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.220]   or who are chronic drinkers
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.500]   or who are chronic drinkers and have gene variants
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.700]   that as they ingest the third and fourth and fifth drink,
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.700]   what happens?
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.060]   They become more alert, they start talking more,
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.800]   they feel great, they have all sorts of ideas
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.260]   about the fun they could have that night
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.380]   and they're the ones
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.660]   that if you've ever fallen asleep at a party
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.340]   for whatever reason or you're getting tired
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.620]   and you're yawning and looking around the room
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.540]   and like these people are still drinking and partying
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.300]   and they're having what seems to be this amazing time,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.740]   often not always,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.020]   those are the future alcoholics in the room
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.700]   or those are the people that have a genetic predisposition
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.060]   for alcoholism or those are the chronic drinkers,
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.820]   the people who have built up enough of a tolerance
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.500]   or who have the chemical genetic makeup
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.940]   such that increasing amounts of alcohol
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.800]   make them feel better and better and better
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.100]   and of course they too have a threshold
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.680]   beyond which their nervous system
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.840]   will start to get diminished
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.340]   and they'll pass out and fall over, et cetera,
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.700]   but that threshold is way, way higher
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.660]   than it is for most people.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.860]   This is important to understand
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.500]   and it's important to understand
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.280]   because I think everyone should know
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.580]   and recognize their own predisposition
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.640]   and kind of risk in terms of developing alcoholism.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.860]   It's also important to understand
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.460]   because it relates to the phenomenon of blackout.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.100]   Many people think that blacking out is passing out,
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.340]   but blackout drunk is when people drink
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.740]   and they're talking and doing things,
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.980]   sometimes sadly or tragically they'll often drive home
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.240]   or walk home or they'll hop on a bicycle and ride home
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.360]   or they'll go swimming in the ocean,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.260]   all of course very dangerous activities to do
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.900]   when people are really drunk
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.660]   or even a little bit drunk in some cases.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.960]   So these people will do these sorts of things
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.640]   and they do them because they have the energy to do them
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.680]   and they feel good while doing them,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.240]   but they are doing them while the activity of neurons
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.880]   in the hippocampus which is involved in memory formation
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.340]   are completely shut off
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.040]   and this is why the next day you tell them,
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.060]   hey, maybe we should talk about what happened last night.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.360]   Like what happened last night?
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.820]   He said, well, do you remember going to the party?
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.660]   Yeah, no, it was great.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.580]   We did this, we did this and then what?
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.140]   And it's very clear all of a sudden
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.980]   that they have no recollection
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.960]   of all the things they were doing despite being awake.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.800]   Now, I wish I could tell you
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.120]   that there's some sort of blood test or other biomarker,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.520]   even a fingerprint test that would allow you
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.360]   to determine whether or not you have a propensity
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.940]   to be one of these drinkers
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.400]   that has a predisposition for alcoholism.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.420]   And if you've ever been blackout drunk
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.280]   and certainly if you've been blackout drunk
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.240]   more than a few times, you should be quite concerned.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.120]   And as we talk more about the more chronic effects
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.880]   and long lasting effects of alcohol consumption
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.580]   a little bit later in the episode,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.500]   I think it will become clear
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.220]   as to why you should be concerned.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.420]   But in any case, there is something that can tell you
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.220]   whether or not you might be in that category
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.020]   versus likely not in that category.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.740]   And I alluded to this a couple of times already,
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.620]   but I want to be really clear
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.980]   that when people drink, no matter who you are,
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.380]   initially there's that shutting down
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.400]   of those prefrontal cortical circuits.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.180]   There's a gradual shutting down of the circuits
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.440]   that control memory,
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.840]   but then people divide into these two bins.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.680]   And these two bins are the people
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.280]   who after more than a couple of drinks
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.060]   start to feel sedated.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.200]   And the people who after more than a few drinks
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.520]   do not start to feel sedated.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.920]   Now, of course, there's going to be differences
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.240]   created by how quickly people are drinking,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.120]   whether or not they're combining different types of alcohol,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.020]   the types of alcohol, et cetera.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.220]   But in general, that can predict whether or not
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.600]   you're somebody who has a predisposition
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.240]   for alcoholism or not.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.600]   One also very interesting finding
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.820]   is that alcohol changes the relationship
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.260]   between what's called the hypothalamus
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.880]   and the pituitary gland and the adrenals.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.140]   Now, the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.700]   about the size of a large gumball
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.100]   sits above the roof of your mouth.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.920]   And it houses neurons that are responsible
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.300]   for some incredible aspects of our behavior
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.100]   and our mindset.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.340]   Things like rage, things like sex drive,
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.980]   things like temperature regulation,
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.060]   very primitive functions,
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.560]   including appetite, thirst, et cetera.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.840]   Alcohol, because it can go anywhere in the brain,
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.040]   remember it's water and fat soluble,
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.280]   has effects on the hypothalamus.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.660]   The hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.160]   to what's called the pituitary gland.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.240]   This is a little gland that actually sticks out of the brain,
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.120]   but it receives instructions from the hypothalamus.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.340]   And then the pituitary releases hormones
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.740]   into the bloodstream that go and talk to your adrenals.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.600]   Your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.880]   in your lower back.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.760]   And the adrenals release, as the name suggests,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.300]   adrenaline, also called epinephrine,
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.720]   and also a molecule called cortisol,
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.640]   which is involved in the kind of longer-term stress response
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.560]   has some healthy effects too on the immune system.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.620]   Okay, so the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.640]   I know that's a mouthful,
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.120]   you don't need to remember the names,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.560]   but the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   maintains your physiological balance
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.160]   of what you perceive as stressful
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   and what you don't perceive as stressful.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.120]   People who drink regularly,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.740]   so this again could be just one or two drinks per night,
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.280]   or it could be somebody that drinks just on Fridays
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.720]   or just on Saturdays, or maybe just on the weekend,
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.020]   two to four drinks.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.740]   Well, those people experience changes
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.000]   in their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.880]   that result in more cortisol,
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.920]   more of this so-called stress hormone
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.600]   being released at baseline when they are not drinking.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.840]   This is really important.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.000]   People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.200]   I don't mean one or two sips
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.720]   or even a glass of wine every once in a while.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.680]   I mean, again, people that are maybe having
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.520]   one drink a night with dinner
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.800]   and maybe on the weekend a few more.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.360]   Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.120]   to explain how it could also be
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.600]   two or three drinks on Friday
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.720]   or six drinks only on Saturday.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.200]   Well, all of those groups experience increases
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.120]   in cortisol release from their adrenal glands
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.440]   when they are not drinking.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.240]   And as a consequence, they feel more stressed
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.560]   and more anxiety when they aren't drinking.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.120]   This is a seldom talked about effect of alcohol
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.520]   because so often we hear about
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.320]   the immediate effects of alcohol, right?
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.200]   And we've been talking about some of those effects,
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.420]   effects like reducing the amount of stress.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.640]   I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say,
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   "Oh, I need a drink."
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.600]   And then they have a drink and they're like, "Calm down."
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.640]   Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.000]   They can start to think about things
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.260]   in a maybe more grounded or rational way,
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.400]   or at least they believe that,
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.240]   or they can somehow just relax themselves.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.020]   Well, while that very well may be true
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.280]   that it can relax them when they are not drinking,
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.960]   that level of cortisol that's released at baseline
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.180]   has increased substantially.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.600]   Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.680]   between brain and body,
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.220]   and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.880]   to some of the other hormones
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.000]   involved in the stress response.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.540]   We'll provide a reference to the study
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.200]   that describes how all of this works
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   for those of you that really want to delve into it.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.480]   But let's go back to this issue
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.500]   of those who are prone to alcoholism
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.000]   versus those who are not.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.360]   Remember, there are people who have genetic variants,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.780]   that meaning genes that they inherited from their parents,
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.900]   that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.040]   But there are also people who drink often,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.900]   who start to experience this increase in alertness
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.720]   the longer they drink across the night.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.200]   Part of that effect we think is because of changes
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.940]   in this hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.440]   So alcohol is kind of a double hit in this sense.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.300]   It's causing changes in our brain circuitry
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.980]   and neurochemistry that at the time
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.940]   in which we're inebriated are detrimental,
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.120]   and it's causing changes in neural circuitry
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.920]   that persist long past the time
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.640]   in which we're experiencing the feeling
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.720]   of being tipsy or drunk.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.000]   Now, again, I don't want to demonize alcohol.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.100]   I'm not saying, oh, you know,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.680]   if you have a glass of wine now and again,
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.860]   or you drink a beer now and again,
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.300]   or even have, you know, a mixed drink now and again,
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.900]   or a shot, that that's necessarily terrible for you.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.620]   I certainly do not want that to be the message.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.120]   What I'm saying is that
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.320]   if people are ingesting alcohol chronically,
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.140]   even if it's not every night,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:10.080]   there are well-recognized changes in neural circuits.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.800]   There are well-recognized changes
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.920]   in neurochemistry within the brain,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.140]   and there are well-recognized changes
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.560]   in the brain-to-body stress system
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.100]   that generally point in three directions,
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.280]   increased stress when people are not drinking,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.240]   diminished mood and feelings of wellbeing
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.280]   when people are not drinking,
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   and as you'll soon learn,
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.440]   changes in the neural circuitry
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.100]   that cause people to want to drink even more
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.800]   in order to get just back to baseline
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.240]   or the place that they were
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.980]   in terms of their stress modulation
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.220]   and in terms of their feelings of mood
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.420]   before they ever started drinking in the first place.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.140]   So again, I don't want to demonize alcohol,
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.840]   but I do want to emphasize
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.280]   that there are long-term plastic changes,
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.100]   meaning changes in neural circuitry and hormone circuitry,
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.780]   that across a period of several months,
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.380]   and certainly across a period of years
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.500]   of the sorts of drinking patterns I described,
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.180]   which I think for most people
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.200]   are going to sound like pretty typical, right?
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.800]   I mean, nothing that I described so far
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.300]   was about drinking a case a night
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.440]   or about binging on alcohol
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.560]   in the way that we often hear about it in the news.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.660]   These are pretty common patterns of alcohol consumption.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.800]   I mean, all you have to do is board a transatlantic flight
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.180]   or actually go to an airport on a Sunday afternoon
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.500]   in a sunny area of the US,
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.640]   and people are having three, four, five, six beers, et cetera.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.860]   Again, personal choice is personal choice.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.040]   I'm not telling you what to do,
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.700]   but it's very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.180]   are changing neural circuitry
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.100]   and they're changing hormone circuitry,
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   and I'd love to be able to tell you
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.320]   that they're changing them for the better,
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.060]   but they simply are not.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.580]   They're actually changing them for the worse,
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.020]   and worse is defined as making people
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.380]   less resilient to stress,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.780]   higher levels of baseline stress, and lower mood overall.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.020]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.120]   I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.340]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.220]   Athletic Greens, AKA AG1, is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.460]   probiotic drink that also has adaptogens
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.140]   and digestive enzymes.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.860]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.300]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.900]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.860]   and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.740]   is that it supplies total foundational coverage
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.140]   of my vitamin mineral needs,
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.100]   and it supplies important nutrients that I need
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.640]   to support my gut microbiome.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.380]   The gut microbiome, as many of you know,
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.480]   supports the immune system.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.500]   It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.860]   which is vital for mood, for energy levels,
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.180]   for regulating focus, and many other features
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.660]   of our mental health and physical health
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.180]   that impact our daily performance and high performance
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.280]   in any endeavors we might be involved in.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.680]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.340]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.940]   and claim a special offer.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.620]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:54.500]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.740]   And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.820]   for all sorts of things like hormone health
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.220]   and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.400]   and calcium regulation.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.620]   Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.100]   to claim that special offer.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.140]   Now, I've been talking a little bit
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.560]   about genetic predisposition,
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.180]   but there are a couple of important points
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.480]   I'd like to make about that.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.260]   First of all, what sorts of genes are involved
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.520]   in setting someone down the path of alcoholism or not?
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.420]   Well, it should come as no surprise
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.380]   that the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies,
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.940]   they tend to fall primarily in the pathways
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.260]   related to genetic control over serotonin receptors,
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.760]   GABA receptors, remember that top-down inhibition
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.660]   and the involvement of GABA, and no surprise, the HPA,
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.740]   the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.340]   All of those, of course, combined with environment,
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.800]   they combine with patterns of abuse, right?
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.240]   We know that if you're in a social setting
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.460]   where a lot of people are drinking,
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.400]   the likelihood that you're going to drink is much higher.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.740]   Social pressures, trauma, right?
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.880]   Some people will use alcohol to self-medicate
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.240]   to try and turn off their thinking
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.440]   or to deal with trauma, et cetera.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.180]   So they combine with the environment,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.520]   but the genes that are in the serotonin synthesis
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.480]   and receptor synthesis pathway, GABA and HPA axis
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.700]   combine with environmental pressures
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.200]   to give rise to alcohol use disorders.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.760]   So there's a fairly coherent picture that we have here, right?
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.120]   This is not a case where, for instance,
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.060]   people that have a lot of the enzyme for metabolizing alcohol
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.020]   which we'll talk about in a minute, alcohol dehydrogenase,
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.160]   it's not like they are necessarily
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.420]   the people that become alcoholics.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.620]   Whereas certainly in certain cultures,
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.840]   certain Asian cultures in particular,
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.740]   there are gene differences that lead them
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.640]   to have low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.480]   There are actually people
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.160]   who have so little alcohol dehydrogenase
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.600]   that when they ingest alcohol,
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.560]   they get very red and they just feel sick.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.100]   So if you're somebody that has a sip of alcohol
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.320]   and you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous,
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.120]   chances are you have gene variants that create a situation
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.000]   where you're not making very much alcohol dehydrogenase.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.080]   You just simply can't metabolize alcohol.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.600]   So you just get a rapid buildup
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.640]   of the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetaldehyde.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.400]   You're not converting it into those empty calories.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.600]   But in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.480]   and genes expressed in people
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.580]   where they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase,
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.400]   sure, they can drink more
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.160]   and they're converting more of that alcohol
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.080]   from its toxic form to a non-toxic form.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.960]   And yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.520]   in those communities because they're drinking more.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.560]   But I do want to emphasize that the environmental factors
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.960]   are playing a strong role there too,
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.360]   because if you can drink more, you're likely to drink more.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   If you're somebody that feels sick immediately
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.180]   from drinking, it's likely that you're not going to engage
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.680]   in alcohol consumption,
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.960]   especially if these things are genetically related.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.520]   And of course, genes and culture and location in the world
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.040]   tend to run together.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.920]   So do you have the gene for alcoholism?
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   Well, there isn't one single gene.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.880]   Chances are if you have an immediate relative
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.140]   who's a chronic abuser of alcohol
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.500]   or several relatives who are chronic abusers of alcohol,
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.140]   well, that's going to predispose you to be an alcoholic.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.360]   But since you don't know which genes you express
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.920]   unless you do genetic testing and those things are available
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.800]   but most people aren't doing that,
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.100]   this assay, if you will, and it's not an assay,
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.920]   as we say, an assay is a test that you run in the lab
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.420]   to determine something.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.720]   And it's not one that I recommend
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.380]   that you go drink in order to do.
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.720]   But if you've noticed that you or somebody else
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.660]   is somebody who can drink a lot throughout the night
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:27.640]   and have increased energy
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.900]   and can just drink and drink a drink,
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.280]   and especially if there's blackout episodes,
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.620]   not remembering things the next day despite being alert
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.580]   throughout the entire night and so on,
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.540]   well, then I would be very concerned
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.260]   that you might actually have a genetic variant
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.020]   predisposing you to alcoholism.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:45.380]   The other thing that predisposes people to abuse of alcohol
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.360]   is age.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.040]   People who start drinking at younger ages
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.760]   are greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.500]   regardless of your family history of alcoholism.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.640]   Okay, so I'm going to repeat that.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.620]   People who start drinking younger
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.580]   are at great risk for developing alcoholism
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.900]   even if they don't have alcoholism in their family.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.580]   Now, of course, you don't have to be an epidemiologist
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.300]   to understand that if you grew up in a family of drinkers
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.860]   and alcohol is everywhere,
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.780]   and especially if there's peer pressure or lack of oversight,
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.260]   then there's going to be a higher tendency
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.080]   or a higher probability, I should say,
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.140]   that you will start drinking at a younger age.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.820]   However, even people that grow up
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.660]   nowhere near their relatives,
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.540]   if they start drinking at a young age,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.380]   so for instance, at 13 or younger or 14 or 15,
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:34.620]   there's a much higher probability
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.060]   that they're going to develop
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.900]   a long-lasting dependence on alcohol.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.760]   People who take their first sip of alcohol later,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.800]   15, 16, or one would hope even later,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.740]   I can say one would hope
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.840]   'cause I'm now of that age and generation
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.260]   where you think about all the things that young people do
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.140]   and you go, oh gosh, if they only would wait
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.000]   or if they only would abstain, it's just what happens.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.280]   I don't know, there's some neural circuit for that
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.540]   that I can't explain yet.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.680]   But people who, for instance,
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.240]   drink only once they reach legal age of drinking,
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.740]   which in the US, I believe in every state is 21 years old,
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.600]   if they take their first drink at 21,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.040]   the probability that they'll go on
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.240]   to develop full-blown alcohol dependence
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.660]   or alcohol use disorder, as it's called, AUD, is very low.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.760]   Now, a subset of them will
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.260]   because they have such a strong genetic predisposition
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.500]   or maybe life circumstances create a pattern
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.460]   in which they become a chronic drinker.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.260]   But I found this very interesting.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.160]   Genes matter, but also the age
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.220]   in which somebody starts drinking really matters.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.180]   Now, whether or not that's because there are changes
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.020]   in neural circuitry as a consequence of that drinking
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.100]   that make people want to seek out more and more alcohol,
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.220]   or whether or not there's some other effect,
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.460]   maybe it's a change in hormones, et cetera,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.440]   that predisposes those young drinkers
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.540]   to become chronic drinkers or even full-blown alcoholics,
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.920]   certainly developing alcohol use disorder,
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.620]   there's definition for that, we can talk about it,
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.520]   it involves the amount of drinking
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.860]   over a certain period of time, et cetera.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.460]   So it's very clear that drinking early in life
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.220]   creates a propensity for the development
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.460]   of alcohol use disorder later in life.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.980]   And while there is a genetic component
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.780]   to developing alcohol use disorder,
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.060]   I find it very interesting
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.580]   that if people who have those gene variants
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.420]   delay their onset of drinking,
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.080]   well, then the probability that they'll develop
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   full-blown alcohol use disorder drops as well.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.680]   So again, it's genes and environments, not an either or,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.100]   and there's no single gene for alcoholism.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.260]   Well, I promise you, I will also talk about
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:33.620]   some of the documented positive effects of alcohol.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.060]   Although they are very few and far between,
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.440]   they do exist.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.640]   But before I do that, I would be remiss
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.680]   if I didn't emphasize some more of the terrible things
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.300]   that alcohol does and the way that it does it.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.060]   And for those of you that enjoy alcohol,
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.700]   I, again, I really, I like to say I feel guilty
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.700]   about telling you this because I know how much
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.740]   some people enjoy a good drink every once in a while,
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.340]   and I say a good drink because some people
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.220]   do like the taste of alcohol.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.060]   I suppose I lucked out in that I don't really like
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.100]   the taste of alcohol and that just puts me to sleep,
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.740]   but I know that people do enjoy it.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.740]   And I do want to point out that there is zero evidence
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.120]   that, you know, provided somebody is of drinking age,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.360]   or certainly not in the stage of brain development,
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.860]   that having one drink or two drinks every now and again,
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.940]   meaning every three or four weeks or once a month,
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.540]   that is not going to cause major health concerns
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.060]   or major health issues for most people.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.100]   I suppose if you have zero or very little
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.940]   alcohol dehydrogenates, it might make you feel sick,
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.340]   but then you're probably not the kind of person
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.260]   that's going to be drinking at all.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.080]   So again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:46.080]   I'm not trying to take them away from you by any means,
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.400]   but you should know what drinking does
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.820]   if you're consuming it in this kind of typical
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:52.680]   chronic pattern, as we can now refer to it,
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.580]   which is that one or two a night or a few stacked up
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.380]   on Friday and maybe three or four on Saturday,
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.380]   this kind of pattern of drinking, which is quite common.
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.920]   And one of the more serious effects
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.080]   that we should think about is the impact
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.540]   on the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.340]   or for sake of today's discussion,
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.180]   the gut-liver brain axis.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.740]   I don't think the gut-liver brain axis
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.340]   has ever been discussed on this podcast.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.620]   Maybe any podcast, although the moment I say that,
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.860]   I'm going to, you know, the gut-liver brain axis,
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.060]   people are going to come after me with,
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.440]   I suppose, gut, liver, brain, and brains.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.180]   In any event, you have a brain, you have a gut,
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.320]   that gut runs from your throat
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.060]   down to the end of your intestine.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.720]   Your gut and your brain communicate by way of nerve cells,
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.340]   neurons, and nerve connections,
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.220]   the vagus nerve in particular,
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.660]   and by way of chemical signaling.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.340]   Your gut also communicates by way of chemical signaling,
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.660]   and believe it or not, by way of neural signaling
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.380]   to your liver.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.820]   And as we talked about earlier,
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.780]   the liver is the first site in which alcohol
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.220]   is broken down and metabolized into its component parts.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:04.280]   The liver is also communicating with the brain
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.900]   through chemical signaling and neural signaling.
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.240]   So we have the gut-liver brain axis.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.900]   And what you find is that people who ingest alcohol
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.020]   at any amount are inducing a disruption
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.060]   in the so-called gut microbiome,
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.980]   the trillions of little micro bacteria
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.500]   that take resident in your gut
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.820]   and that live inside you all the time
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.300]   and that help support your immune system
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.920]   and that literally signal by way of electrical signals
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.940]   and chemical signals to your brain
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.480]   to increase the release of things like serotonin
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.100]   and dopamine and regulate your mood
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.580]   generally in positive ways.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.980]   Well, alcohol really disrupts those bacteria.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.160]   And this should come as no surprise.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.240]   I mean, earlier we talked about this and it's well known.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.260]   If you want to sterilize something,
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.060]   you want to kill the bacteria, you pour alcohol on it.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.840]   And I can remember scraping myself or cutting myself.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:55.820]   I was always injuring myself when I was a kid.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.460]   And the moment they take out the peroxide,
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.580]   you're like, "Oh boy, here it comes."
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.360]   But if there's no peroxide around
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.380]   and you've got a wound there and you need to clean it out,
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.940]   yeah, they'll use alcohol,
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.460]   which I do not recommend by the way.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.600]   That's one of the harshest ways to clean a wound.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.020]   But for centuries, thousands of years really,
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.920]   alcohol has been used in order to clean things
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.620]   and kill bacteria.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.700]   So alcohol kills bacteria and it is indiscriminate
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.180]   with respect to which bacteria it kills.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.420]   So when we ingest alcohol and it goes into our gut,
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.840]   it kills a lot of the healthy gut microbiota.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.960]   At the same time, the metabolism of alcohol in the liver,
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.120]   which you now understand,
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   that pathway involving NAD, acetylaldehyde and acetate,
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.800]   that pathway is pro-inflammatory.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.840]   So it's increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines,
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.800]   things like IL-6, et cetera, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.380]   If you'd like to learn more about the immune system,
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.460]   we did an episode all about the immune system.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.940]   You can find it at hubermanlab.com.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.420]   It'll teach you all the basics of what are cytokines,
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.500]   what are mast cells, et cetera.
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.800]   In any event, all these pro-inflammatory molecules,
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.920]   those are being released.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.340]   You've now got disruption of the gut microbiota.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.500]   As a consequence, the lining of the gut is disrupted
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:14.980]   and you develop at least transiently leaky gut.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.420]   That is bacteria that exists in the gut,
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.700]   which are bad bacteria,
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.780]   can now pass out of the gut into the bloodstream.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.020]   So you've got a two hit kind of model here.
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.420]   In biology, we talk about two hit models
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.900]   that is kind of a one plus one equals four.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.300]   And it's generally when you hear two hit,
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.700]   it's not a good thing.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.180]   So you've got bad bacteria from partially broken down food
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:36.260]   moving out of the gut.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.340]   The good bacteria in the gut have been killed.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.740]   You might say, why doesn't the alcohol
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.980]   kill the bad bacteria in the gut?
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:46.980]   Well, the bad bacteria that are from partially digested food
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.380]   oftentimes escape the gut
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.420]   before the alcohol can disrupt them.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.380]   And so now you've got leaks in the gut wall.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.180]   You've got the release of this bad bacteria.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.260]   You've got inflammatory cytokines
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.220]   and other things being released from the liver.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.780]   And they are able to get into the brain
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.440]   through what's called a neuroimmune signaling.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.860]   And what's really bizarre in terms of the way
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.740]   that this manifests in the brain,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.840]   I mean, it's not the way I would have done it,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.160]   but then again, as I always say,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.660]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.680]   And anyone who says they did,
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.520]   you should be very skeptical of them.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:24.000]   The net effect of this is actually to disrupt
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.380]   the neural circuits that control regulation
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.720]   of alcohol intake.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.340]   And the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.760]   So this is just terrible, right?
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.000]   I mean, so you're taking in something
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.760]   that disrupts two systems, the gut microbiota,
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.820]   and it disrupts in two ways.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.920]   It's killing the good gut microbiota,
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.800]   and it's allowing the bad bacteria
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.480]   to move from the gut into the bloodstream.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.680]   You've also got pro-inflammatory cytokines
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.280]   coming from the liver, and those converge
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.660]   or arrive in the brain and create a system
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.120]   in which the neural circuits cause more drinking.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.460]   That's a bad situation.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.000]   And this is why people who drink regularly,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.920]   even if it's not a ton of alcohol,
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.440]   again, of the sorts of patterns of drinking
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.160]   I talked about before, and certainly for those
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.560]   that are chronic heavy drinkers,
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.320]   what you end up with is a situation
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.760]   in which you have inflammation in multiple places
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.320]   in the brain and body and the desire to drink even more
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.300]   and to further exacerbate that inflammation
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.080]   and the gut leakiness.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.240]   So this is basically a terrible scenario
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.560]   for the gut-liver-brain axis.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:29.880]   And it's especially prevalent
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.400]   in so-called alcohol use disorder.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.640]   Again, people that are ingesting somewhere
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.920]   between 12 and 24 drinks per week.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.720]   For those of you that are interested in learning more
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.200]   about the gut-liver-brain axis
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.080]   and in particular alcohol use disorder,
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.240]   I'll provide a link in the show note captions.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.520]   And there's a wonderful review on this that details that.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.440]   But on the positive side,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.040]   it points to the possibility that at least some,
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.600]   again, at least some of the negative effects
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.640]   of alcohol consumption,
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.760]   whether or not you're somebody
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.960]   who's currently ingesting alcohol
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.280]   or who used to ingest alcohol
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.400]   and is trying to so-called repair these systems
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.520]   of the brain and body,
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.940]   whether or not replenishing the gut microbiota
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.840]   is going to be beneficial.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.020]   And we know that there are ways to do that.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.060]   And we know that there's at least some promise
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.800]   for the ability for the system to repair itself.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.080]   How does one do that?
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.200]   Well, I've talked before about this on the podcast,
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.700]   but studies done by colleagues of mine at Stanford,
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.040]   Justin Sonnenberg, who's been on this podcast as a guest,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.100]   an amazing episode all about the gut microbiome
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.720]   and his collaborator, Chris Garner,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.800]   also at Stanford School of Medicine,
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.780]   have explored not alcoholism,
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:32.840]   but what are ways to improve the gut microbiota
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.600]   in particular to reduce the production
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.460]   of inflammatory cytokines
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.520]   and to adjust what's called the inflammatome.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.080]   You've heard of the genome and the proteome, et cetera.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.880]   Well, the inflammatome is the total array,
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.960]   or at least the near total array of genes and proteins
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.320]   that control inflammation.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.740]   How can you reduce inflammation
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.160]   and make that inflammatome healthier?
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.000]   Well, they've shown that two to four servings
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.640]   of fermented foods per day,
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.680]   and here I'm not referring to fermented alcohol,
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.320]   I'm talking about low sugar fermented foods,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.560]   so things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.940]   for those of you that like Japanese food.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.300]   There are others, I know, things like kefir,
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.600]   things like yogurts that have a lot of active bacteria,
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.100]   again, low sugar varieties of all these things.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:23.040]   Those are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.760]   and at improving the gut microbiome.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.960]   One could imagine that either inoculating oneself
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.640]   from some of the effects of alcohol,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.560]   although I'd prefer that people
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.480]   just not drink alcohol chronically, frankly,
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.160]   or if somebody is trying to repair their gut microbiome
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.480]   because they ingested a lot of alcohol
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.600]   or because they had a lot of these inflammatory cytokines
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.400]   for many years or even a short period of time,
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.560]   regular ingestion of two to four servings
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.820]   of these fermented foods can be quite beneficial.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:53.160]   Want to make it clear that has not been examined
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.120]   specifically in the context of alcohol use disorder,
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.620]   but because a huge component of the negative effects
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.340]   of alcohol use disorder are based in this gut liver,
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.280]   brain access and disruption of the gut microbiome
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.080]   and the inflammatory cytokines,
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.220]   it stands to reason that things that are well-established
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.920]   to improve inflammation status,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.580]   in other words, reduce inflammation,
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.200]   such as ingesting two to four servings
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.160]   of low sugar fermented foods per day,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.480]   makes sense in terms of trying to repair
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.240]   or replenish the system.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.800]   One could also imagine taking probiotics or prebiotics.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   Certainly that would work as well,
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.800]   although I've sort of favored the discussion
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.620]   around fermented foods and replenishment
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.940]   of the gut microbiome,
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.840]   mostly because there are more studies
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.520]   that have examined that in humans
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.500]   and because of the direct relationship
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.120]   that's been established between doing that
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.280]   and reducing negative markers within the inflammatome.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.160]   And I should mention along the lines of repair and recovery,
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.240]   I put out a question on Twitter the other day.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.140]   I said, "What do you want to know about alcohol?"
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.240]   I got more than a thousand questions.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.520]   And we'll take some more of those questions
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.480]   a little later in the episode.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   But one of the things I noticed
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.000]   is that many of the questions, hundreds in fact,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.360]   related to the question of,
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.760]   "Well, if I drank a lot previously, am I doomed?
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.400]   Can I reverse the negative effects?"
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.560]   Or, "I'm trying to drink less
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.860]   and I'm trying to improve my health as I do that.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.700]   What should I do?"
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:16.100]   Well, certainly focusing a bit on the gut microbiome
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.520]   ought to be useful.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.220]   The other thing that I should mention is
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.040]   as people wean themselves off alcohol,
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.300]   even if they're not full-blown alcoholics
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.000]   or have alcohol use disorder,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.880]   they should understand that that increase in cortisol
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.880]   that we talked about earlier
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.020]   that leads to lower stress threshold
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.580]   and greater feelings of anxiety and stress,
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.940]   that's going to be present
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.280]   and it's going to take some time to dissipate.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.600]   So for some people, it might even just be helpful to realize
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.520]   that as you try and wean yourself off alcohol
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.220]   or maybe even go cold turkey,
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.360]   that increased anxiety and feelings of stress
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.620]   should be expected.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.400]   And in that case, I would point you to an episode
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.920]   that we did on master stress.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.720]   You can find that again at hubermanlab.com.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.800]   It's got a ton of behavioral,
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.600]   nutritional, supplementation-based, exercise-based,
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.320]   I suppose exercise is behavioral.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.800]   But a lot of tools, you can navigate to those easily
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.720]   'cause we have timestamps.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.340]   You can go right to the topic of interest.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.720]   Those tools are going to be very useful
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.260]   in trying to clamp or control your stress.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.340]   And the point here is just that some increase in stress
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.980]   should be expected.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.100]   And it should be expected
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.120]   because of that increase in cortisol that occurs
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.320]   with even low-level consumption,
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.380]   yet chronic alcohol consumption.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.600]   Now I'd like to talk about a fairly common phenomenon,
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.420]   which is post-alcohol consumption malaise,
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.000]   also referred to as hangover.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.040]   Hangover is a constellation of effects
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.120]   ranging from headache to nausea
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.520]   to what's sometimes called a anxiety,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.780]   which is anxiety that follows a day of drinking.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.200]   Hangxiety, I think we can understand physiologically
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.860]   if we think about that process of alcohol intake
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.920]   increasing the amount of cortisol
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.540]   and the ratio of cortisol to some other stress hormones.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.200]   That well explains why some people wake up the day after
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.740]   or even the day after a night drinking
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.420]   and feel anxious and not well and stressed
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.200]   for reasons they don't understand.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.260]   So if you're somebody who experiences hangxiety,
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.460]   then again, I refer you to the master stress episode
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.340]   that we put out some time ago,
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.280]   and you can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.500]   Tools to deal with anxiety,
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.860]   tools to deal with stress ranging again from behavioral
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.840]   to nutritional, supplement-based, et cetera.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.760]   That, of course, is not justification for going out
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.640]   and drinking so much
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.000]   that you get hangxiety-induced hangover.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.920]   But for those of you that are experiencing
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.380]   post-alcohol consumption hangxiety, as it were,
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.780]   that could be a useful resource
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.380]   because I certainly don't want anyone
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.120]   experiencing uncomfortable amounts of anxiety,
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.540]   and there are great tools and resources for that.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.100]   Now, the other aspects of hangover,
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.340]   such as the stomach ache or headache
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.140]   or feelings of malaise or fogginess,
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.780]   those can be related to a number of different things
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.140]   and probably are related to a number of different things.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:10.020]   First of all, the sleep that one gets after even just one,
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.940]   yes, even just one glass of wine or a beer
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:15.660]   is not the same sleep that you get
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.260]   when you don't have alcohol circulating in your system.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.620]   And not trying to be a downer here,
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.660]   but this was discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast episode
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:26.100]   where I had Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley on,
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.820]   and of course, Dr. Walker is a world expert in sleep,
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.540]   runs one of the preeminent laboratories
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.500]   studying sleep and its effects,
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.540]   wrote the incredible book, "Why We Sleep," and so on.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:40.260]   Dr. Walker told me, and it certainly is supported
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.300]   by lots and lots of quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.020]   in animals and in humans,
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:48.400]   that when alcohol is present in the brain and bloodstream,
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.260]   that the architecture of sleep is disrupted.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.140]   Slow wave sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.060]   all of which are essential
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.260]   for getting a restorative night's sleep are all disrupted.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.680]   So for those of you that are drinking a glass or two of wine
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.700]   or having a hard liquor drink or a beer
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.360]   in order to fall asleep,
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.900]   the sleep you're getting is simply not high quality sleep
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.700]   or certainly not as high quality as the sleep
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.940]   you'd be getting if you did not have alcohol in your system.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.740]   Of course, when we're talking about hangover,
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.100]   we're talking generally about the consumption
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.540]   of more than just one or two drinks.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.580]   Of course, for some people,
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.200]   one or two drinks is probably sufficient to induce hangover,
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.900]   but for most people, it's going to be having three or four,
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.580]   exceeding their typical limit, as it's called.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.660]   Again, not the legal limit, that's a whole other business.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.160]   But when one ingests too much alcohol for them,
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.300]   one of the reasons they feel terrible the next day
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.340]   is because their sleep isn't really good sleep.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.860]   In fact, it's not even sleep,
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.820]   it's often considered pseudo-sleep,
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.740]   or at least that's what it's called
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.060]   in the sleep science field,
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.000]   because people are in kind of a low-level hypnotic
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.540]   kind of trance, it's not real sleep,
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.940]   there are multiple bouts of waking up,
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.860]   they may not even realize they're waking up multiple times.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.620]   Okay, so there's the sleep-induced effects.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:01.820]   Then there are the disrupted gut microbiome effects,
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.140]   some of which we talked about earlier,
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.980]   so now you understand the mechanism
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.520]   of alcohol destroying good, healthy gut microbiota,
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.240]   which then leads to leaky gut and things of that sort.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.980]   But one could imagine, again, could imagine,
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.700]   and there is some evidence starting to support this,
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.480]   that again, ingesting low-sugar fermented foods,
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.300]   or maybe in prebiotic or probiotics
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.500]   to support the gut microbiome might assist
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:30.180]   in some of the gut-related malaise associated with hangover.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:33.420]   In other words, get those gut microbiota healthy again
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.060]   as quickly as possible, or maybe even before you drink,
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.320]   have those gut microbiota healthy,
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.160]   I would hope that you would do that.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.540]   I think everybody should be doing something
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.920]   to support their gut microbiome,
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.940]   whether or not it's the ingestion
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.780]   of low-sugar fermented foods daily,
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.540]   or at least on a regular basis,
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.940]   or ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic,
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.440]   the gut microbiome is so important
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.100]   for so many different things.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.980]   In terms of hangover and headache,
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:58.020]   we know that that's caused by vasoconstriction,
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.500]   the constriction of blood vessels
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.900]   that tends to occur as a rebound after a night of drinking.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.780]   Alcohol can act as a vasodilator,
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.020]   it can dilate the blood vessels.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.300]   Part of that is associated with the increase
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.300]   in so-called parasympathetic tone.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.760]   We have an autonomic nervous system,
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.900]   it's got a sympathetic component.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.160]   These are neurons that make us more alert,
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.540]   and if they're very active, they make us very stressed.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.620]   There's also the parasympathetic aspect
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.660]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.140]   This is all just fancy geek speak
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.920]   for the parts of your brain and body,
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.580]   the nerve cells that make you very relaxed.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.700]   When you're very relaxed, there tends to be vasodilation.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.620]   It allows for more movement of blood and other things
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.420]   through the bloodstream,
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.640]   and alcohol tends to induce some vasodilation,
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.340]   at least in some of the capillary beds.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.320]   And then when the alcohol wears off,
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.080]   there's vasoconstriction, and people get brutal headaches.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.940]   That's why some people will take aspirin or Tylenol
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.440]   or Advil or things like that,
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.860]   the sort of non-steroid anti-inflammatories.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.560]   I should mention there's a lot of literature coming out
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.300]   that some of these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.480]   are not good for us for a number of different reasons,
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.320]   the way they impact the liver,
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.300]   the way they impact the immune system,
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:11.860]   and no surprise, the way they impact the gut microbiome.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:13.400]   So I'm not one to tell you
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.360]   what medications to take or not take,
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.740]   but you certainly would want to do a quick web search
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:22.740]   of effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatories and aspirin
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.920]   before you start taking those,
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.620]   or stop taking those for that matter.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.120]   Generally, they will alleviate headache,
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.900]   but they can often have other issues,
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.820]   including liver issues.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.820]   And keep in mind, the night after drinking,
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.980]   your liver has already taken a beating
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.020]   because of the need of the liver
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.820]   to convert alcohol from acetaldehyde into acetate,
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.020]   which is now a pathway that you well understand.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.660]   So I'm not certain,
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.540]   and in fact, I believe it's not the greatest idea
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.500]   to burden your liver further through the use of things
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.940]   that are going to cause it to have to work harder
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.020]   and metabolize things
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.680]   if the goal is simply to alleviate a headache.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.100]   There's a lot of kind of lore,
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.060]   old school lore about how to relieve a hangover.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.060]   We already talked about how eating food won't do that,
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.620]   but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.880]   of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.660]   There's the lore that one should simply ingest more alcohol.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.260]   What terrible advice that is.
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.460]   That's just going to delay an even worse hangover.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.220]   However, I'd be remiss if I didn't say
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:25.420]   that the reason that that myth came to be,
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.380]   or that I should say that truth came to be,
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.120]   because indeed ingesting more alcohol
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.640]   will alleviate a hangover,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.700]   but then a worse hangover will show up.
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.980]   The reason that came to be is because ingestion of more
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.760]   alcohol will cause those constricted vessels
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.980]   that are giving the headache to dilate again.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.460]   But of course, ingesting more alcohol to relieve a hangover
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.960]   is simply a bad idea.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.800]   Just don't do it.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.680]   I think this is called the hair of the dog approach.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.220]   Maybe someone can put in the show note captions on YouTube
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.980]   why it's called the hair of the dog.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.320]   I can come up with a few ideas,
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.420]   but they're not going to be very good ones.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.940]   And some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:04.600]   So do not ingest more alcohol simply to try
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.580]   and recover from a hangover.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.720]   I know many people have tried that one before,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.520]   but that's a terrible idea.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.080]   Now, one thing that you'll also hear out there
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.180]   is that deliberate cold exposure,
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.200]   for instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.720]   I find this one particularly interesting
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.900]   because we've done episodes on the benefits
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.840]   of deliberate cold exposure.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.800]   We have an entire episode about that.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.360]   You can find it again, human lab.com.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.040]   There are direct links to some of the tools
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.840]   related to deliberate cold exposure.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.680]   And we have an entire newsletter
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.460]   on deliberate cold exposure protocols.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.820]   You can find on human lab.com
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.680]   go to our neural network newsletter.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   So those of you that are interested in ice baths
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.140]   and cold showers and ways to leverage those,
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.440]   you can find that there.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.200]   What you won't find there is a description
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.600]   of how to use deliberate cold exposure
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.100]   for sake of treating hangover.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.440]   But here I went into the literature
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.080]   and I found something kind of interesting.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.720]   There is some evidence that increasing levels of epinephrine
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.680]   in the bloodstream can actually help with alcohol clearance.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.920]   That was very surprising to me.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.760]   And I want to point out,
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.000]   this is not a large and robust literature,
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.880]   but there's some evidence pointing to the fact
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.900]   that when levels of epinephrine, adrenaline,
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.920]   are raised in the brain and bloodstream,
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.120]   that some of the components of alcohol metabolism
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.140]   can be accelerated
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.980]   and some of the inebriating effects of alcohol
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:15.820]   can be reduced.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.320]   So maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.660]   actually has something to it.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.000]   So in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.560]   in order to reduce the effects of hangover
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.040]   or to more rapidly clear alcohol
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.740]   from the brain and bloodstream,
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.080]   I want to be very clear
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.520]   and I want to emphasize your safety.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.400]   The way to do that is to understand
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.800]   that alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay?
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.540]   It can make people slightly hypothermic.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.960]   It's going to drop core body temperature.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.440]   So if you were inebriated
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.000]   and you went and got into a body of water, right?
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   A pool or a lake or something,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.240]   first of all, that's extremely dangerous to do
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.540]   while you're inebriated, right?
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.760]   People drown all the time.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.120]   People drown, they die as a consequence of doing that.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.940]   So please don't do that.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.040]   But also if it's very cold water,
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.740]   your core body temperature is going to drop even further.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.120]   Now, if you've heard the episodes
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.660]   that I've done on deliberate cold exposure,
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.080]   previously I've talked about how normally
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.300]   when people are not ingesting alcohol,
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.040]   they get into an ice bath or a cold shower
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.820]   and their body temperature initially dips,
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.420]   but then it rebounds and increases.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.920]   That's a process that's going to occur
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.560]   when people do not have alcohol in their system.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.980]   When you have alcohol in your system,
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:27.660]   one of the reasons that you become hypothermic
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:29.180]   is because there's a disruption
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.620]   in those hypothalamic brain areas,
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.640]   in particular the brain area
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.440]   called the medial preoptic area
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.400]   that regulates core body temperature.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.980]   So it's not so much that alcohol makes you cold,
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.480]   it's that alcohol disrupts the central command centers
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.760]   of the brain that control temperature regulation
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.740]   and that leads you to be slightly hypothermic.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:49.160]   So if you then go get into a very cold lake
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.540]   or you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath,
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:56.320]   there's the possibility of you going very, very far down
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.200]   the ladder into very hypothermic territory
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.740]   and that can be very dangerous.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.380]   Now, in terms of dealing with hangover
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:05.200]   when the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system,
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.940]   well, that's where some of this kind of old lore
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.600]   combines with some of the modern science and says,
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.180]   well, if you can spike adrenaline
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.220]   and certainly getting into an ice bath
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.860]   or getting into a cold shower
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.120]   or any kind of cold body of water,
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.340]   provided you can do that safely,
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.660]   that will sharply increase your adrenaline
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:24.740]   and I should say your dopamine, that's been shown
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.380]   and we've talked about this on the podcast before,
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.400]   you get these long extended increases, several hours
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.780]   of increases in dopamine from deliberate cold exposure.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.180]   It's well-documented in humans, by the way.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.920]   So one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.880]   as a way to accelerate the recovery from hangover.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.260]   Provided that's done safely,
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.500]   I think there's no reason to not explore that
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.860]   and if you're wondering what safely is
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.260]   and what temperatures to use,
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:52.540]   please check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.860]   Cold showers therefore might actually be one way
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.640]   to at least partially relieve hangover.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.740]   Certainly the science from various places
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.300]   in the literature converge to say that,
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:05.660]   but again, be careful, please, please, please be careful
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.180]   not to get into cold water when you are inebriated.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.180]   It's absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.700]   and it's dangerous also for the non-obvious reasons,
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.780]   not the least of which is the dramatic decreases
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:18.980]   in core body temperature
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.380]   that can make you dangerously hypothermic.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.660]   Now, how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.520]   to accelerate recovery from hangover?
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.400]   Well, there I would look to the kind of standard protocols
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.520]   of one to three minutes or maybe even six minutes
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.280]   if you can tolerate or if you're really cold adapted,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.740]   maybe you do seven or 10 minutes in a cold shower,
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.640]   although that could be a lot.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.300]   Most people are going to experience a sharp increase
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.620]   in epinephrine and adrenaline
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.220]   and a long lasting increase in dopamine
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.460]   from one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure,
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.180]   ideally done immersion up to the neck,
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.280]   again, do this safely, please, please, please,
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.220]   or a cold shower where you're getting under the shower
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.040]   as much as possible.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.700]   How cold, well, that's going to vary person to person.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.500]   I suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.880]   such that you really want to get out,
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.260]   but then you know you can stay in safely
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.780]   without, for instance, giving yourself a heart attack
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.420]   because if the water is really, really cold,
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.740]   of course you can give yourself a heart attack.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.380]   Most showers won't go that cold,
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   although probably some will.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.780]   Again, please use caution, spike your adrenaline,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.860]   spike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.200]   Other components of hangover that could be good targets
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.940]   for trying to alleviate hangover,
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.980]   and here I hope you are getting the picture
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.600]   because it is accurate to say that hangover
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.740]   is a multifaceted phenomenon.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.540]   It's not like one molecule and one receptor.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.800]   It's a bunch of things happening in the brain and body,
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.860]   but is the dehydration associated with alcohol.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.800]   Alcohol is a diuretic for multiple reasons.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.860]   It causes people to excrete not only water, but also sodium.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.480]   Sodium is an electrolyte critical
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.660]   for the function of neurons.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.040]   So making sure that you have enough sodium, potassium,
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.460]   and magnesium, so-called electrolytes,
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.980]   is going to be important for proper brain function,
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.580]   bodily organ function.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.620]   Even for people that have just had one or two drinks
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:59.900]   the night before, it's likely that your electrolyte balance
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.340]   and your fluid balance is going to be disrupted,
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.660]   and that's because alcohol
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.340]   also disrupts the so-called vasopressin pathway.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.500]   I talked a lot about vasopressin
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.980]   and the way that it interacts with
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.620]   and controls different aspects of water retention
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.180]   and water release from the body in the form of urine
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.180]   in the episode on salt.
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.760]   So again, I'm referring to Hubermanlab.com
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.220]   as the site where you can find that episode
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.100]   on salt balance and ways to restore electrolyte balance.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:29.740]   Having your electrolytes at the proper levels
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.340]   before you drink is ideal.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.180]   Some people will say for every glass of alcohol
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:36.860]   that you drink, you should drink one glass of water.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:40.060]   I would say better would be two glasses of water
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.020]   given the dehydrating effects of alcohol,
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.540]   and even better would be water with electrolytes.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.020]   That certainly would set you up
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.840]   for a better day the next day.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.080]   And if you don't manage to do that,
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.200]   'cause I suppose it's kind of geeky
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.420]   walking around with electrolyte packets
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.060]   out at the bar or whatnot,
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:59.080]   although, you know, geeky in my book is a good thing,
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.540]   the next day you could take some electrolytes upon waking,
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:04.620]   maybe even some before you go to sleep
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.940]   at the night of drinking.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.000]   So hangovers made worse by disturbed sleep,
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.860]   made worse by disrupted gut microbiome,
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.020]   made worse by disrupted electrolytes,
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:16.420]   made worse by the depletion of epinephrine and dopamine.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.800]   That's why replenishing the microbiome with fermented foods,
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.680]   low sugar fermented foods that is,
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.540]   that's why using safe deliberate cold exposure
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.940]   for spiking adrenaline and for increasing dopamine,
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:32.600]   and that's why consuming electrolytes
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.760]   are all going to be beneficial.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.440]   The folks over at examine.com, a website that I really like
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.100]   because it just has so much useful information,
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.320]   have assembled a list of things that have been proposed,
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.820]   purported to improve, or I should say,
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:51.620]   to remove the effects of hangover.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.320]   And as they point out, and I would like to point out
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.900]   over there, there isn't a lot of quality science
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.760]   to support the idea that any one compound
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.100]   can eliminate hangover.
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.140]   And that's probably because hangover, again,
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:05.940]   arises from multiple organs and tissues and systems
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.380]   in both the brain and body.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.720]   Nonetheless, they have a terrific list over there of things,
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.020]   everything from Japanese pear fruit juice
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.280]   has been proposed to do this,
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.560]   to some other really esoteric things,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.800]   even things like yohimbine.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.520]   Frankly, when I look at the literature there and elsewhere,
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.100]   one simply cannot find the magic substance, the one herb,
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.820]   the one potion that can wipe away hangover.
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.380]   Getting rid of hangover is going to be best solved
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.060]   by doing a collection of a small number
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.760]   of very powerful things,
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.400]   of which I've already listed off a few.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.040]   However, there are some additional things
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.460]   that one can do for relieving hangover.
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.820]   And one of them is to be very thoughtful
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.380]   about what sorts of alcohol one consumes.
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.100]   So I find this interesting.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.620]   There have actually been studies of which types of alcohol
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.180]   lead to the greatest hangovers.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:06.220]   There's actually a lot of legend and lore about this as well.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.560]   Some people have said, for instance,
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.180]   that drinks that have a high sugar content
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.320]   lead to greater hangovers.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.640]   Turns out that's not the case,
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.700]   or at least that's not what the science points to.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.780]   If you look at the expected hangover severity,
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:21.960]   what you find is that at the bottom end of the scale,
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.820]   there's a drink that I'm not going to tell you for the moment
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.940]   but what you find is that near it is, for instance, beer.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.200]   The consumption of beer,
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.620]   provided it is not overconsumption, right?
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.860]   It's not far beyond the tolerance of the individual.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.300]   So it's one or two beers,
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:42.640]   is less likely to cause a hangover than, say, whiskey.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.260]   And a glass of whiskey,
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.900]   or I should not as much whiskey as beer, of course,
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.460]   but a glass of whiskey, for instance,
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:53.100]   is more likely to cause hangover than gin, as it turns out.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.340]   Again, this is what's fallen out of the data.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.060]   And yet a glass of rum or red wine
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.080]   is more likely to cause a hangover
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.420]   than any of the other things I've mentioned so far.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.540]   At the top, top, top of the list of drinks
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.980]   that induce hangover is brandy.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.800]   And one could then say,
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.620]   well, doesn't brandy have a lot of sugar?
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:14.420]   Maybe it's the sugar that's causing hangovers.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.000]   And this is something that's been, again,
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.500]   discussed over and over that people say,
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.860]   oh, it's the high sugar drinks that cause hangover.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:24.340]   It turns out, however, that when one looks at drinks,
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.900]   alcoholic drinks and sugar content and hangover,
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.220]   at the very bottom of the list is,
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.000]   gosh, this makes me cringe just to think about,
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.380]   is ethanol diluted in orange juice?
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.580]   Oh, I can't believe people actually drink this,
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.260]   but ethanol diluted in orange juice.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:41.380]   So this is not vodka and orange juice, okay?
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.900]   Vodka was third on the list
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.320]   from the bottom of drinks that induce hangover.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.420]   Again, this is within amounts
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.220]   that are comfortable for the person to drink,
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.040]   that they have enough experience with,
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.640]   or that they have the body weight to tolerate
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.540]   without getting very, very drunk.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.660]   So the point is that if it were sugar
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.700]   that's causing hangover,
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.940]   well, then the ethanol dilute in orange juice
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.680]   would probably be at the top of the list
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.260]   in terms of inducing hangover.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.780]   But it's not, it's at the bottom of the list.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.940]   And brandy is at the top of the list.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.940]   So what you find is that what scales
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:15.360]   from ethanol diluted in orange juice
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.660]   to beer to vodka to gin,
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.520]   here I'm ascending the hierarchy of things
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.160]   that cause hangover, gin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine,
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.100]   and then brandy at the peak,
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.660]   it's sort of the world heavyweight champion
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:29.140]   of hangover-inducing drinks.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:34.140]   Well, what's increasing are congeners within those drinks.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.900]   Congeners are things like nitrites and other substances
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:41.720]   that give alcohol its distinctive flavor
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.660]   and that also lead to some of the
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.880]   inebriating effects of alcohol.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.040]   Now, then you ask, okay, well,
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.820]   what is it that these congeners are doing
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.160]   and what are these nitrites doing?
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.520]   And guess what?
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.120]   While they do have effects on the brain
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.060]   and on other tissues,
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:00.840]   their main effects are to disrupt the gut microbiome.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.400]   So what this points to, again,
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.860]   is that having a healthy gut microbiome
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.620]   and perhaps ensuring that you bolster your gut microbiome
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:14.500]   the day after drinking is going to be especially important
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.620]   for warding off hangover,
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.400]   at least reducing the effects of hangover
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.580]   or the symptoms of hangover or both.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:24.100]   I would love to see a study on this.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.960]   I could imagine designing the study myself,
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.620]   although this isn't really the sorts of things
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.120]   my laboratory does,
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.780]   but you can imagine some people getting probiotic
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.900]   and prebiotic, some regularly,
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.200]   some just after drinking or low sugar fermented foods
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.220]   and see what the effects are
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:40.620]   in terms of subjective effects of hangover,
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.480]   but also some physiological measures.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.780]   I think that way to think about hangover overall
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:50.120]   is that, again, it represents a multifaceted,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.980]   multi-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.580]   And the best way to deal with it
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:59.820]   is as a multi-cell, multi-tissue, multi-chemical phenomenon.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.360]   And before I listed off some of the things
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.980]   that one could do in order to adjust hangover,
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:08.660]   again, the one that comes out at the top of that list,
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.900]   I believe, at least based on my read of the data,
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.420]   is to support the gut microbiome
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:16.580]   and certainly not to ingest more alcohol.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:19.100]   And I suppose if we were to get really honest
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.020]   with one another and ask,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.360]   what's the best way to avoid a hangover?
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.620]   It would be to not drink in the first place.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.160]   So we've covered the major effects of alcohol
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.700]   that lead to this state that we call drunkenness
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.300]   or inebriation.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.460]   Again, there's a range there.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.180]   It can be tipsy, people can be blackout drunk,
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.300]   people can be passed out drunk.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.000]   We've also talked about hangover
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.500]   and the fact that it's a multifaceted phenomenon
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.140]   and recovery from hangover
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.800]   involves a multifaceted approach.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.700]   Next, I want to talk about tolerance.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.440]   Tolerance to alcohol is a very interesting phenomenon.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.400]   It has roots mainly in the brain and in brain systems.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.160]   There's not time in the world,
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.540]   let alone within this podcast,
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.540]   to get into all the aspects of tolerance.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.080]   There are more than 10 different types of tolerance.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.780]   There's functional tolerance, chronic tolerance,
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:12.420]   rapid tolerance, there's metabolic tolerance,
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.580]   there's psychological tolerance.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.700]   Let's keep it simple for sake of today's discussion.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.540]   And for those of you that are interested in learning
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.300]   about all the different types of tolerance
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.700]   and aspects of tolerance, there's an excellent review.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:24.980]   We will provide a link to this.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.520]   This was published in 2021, so it's pretty recent.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.700]   In the journal, "Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior,"
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.580]   incidentally, or not so incidentally,
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.420]   that was the first journal I ever published in.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.400]   So I have a particular affection for that journal.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.380]   Nonetheless, it is called "Tolerance to Alcohol,
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.640]   a Critical Yet Understudied Factor in Alcohol Addiction."
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.500]   And while this paper does include alcohol addiction
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:52.660]   in the title, it's not just about alcohol addiction.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.760]   Here's the basic summary of what tolerance is.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.860]   First of all, tolerance refers to the reduced effects
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.020]   of alcohol with repeated exposure.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:03.260]   And it is caused mainly by changes
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.120]   in neurotransmitter systems in the brain
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.500]   that are the direct consequence of the toxicity of alcohol,
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.660]   that aldehyde molecule that we talked about before.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:16.360]   There's an enormous number of chemicals that change
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.000]   with repeated exposure to acetaldehyde,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.300]   everything from GABA to dopamine to serotonin,
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.120]   second messenger systems, adenosine, and on and on.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.940]   Rather than go into each of those in detail,
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:31.220]   I just want to talk about the contour of the reinforcing
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.300]   and the tolerance-inducing effects of alcohol.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.620]   What do I mean by that?
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:38.680]   Well, here we are back to our old friend,
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.660]   meaning the molecule that comes up over and over again
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.860]   in these podcast episodes, which is dopamine.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.220]   Whether or not somebody has a predisposition alcoholism
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.900]   or not, whether or not they're experienced drinker or not,
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.180]   when people initially start drinking,
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.180]   there are increases in dopamine
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.220]   or what we call dopaminergic transmission.
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:58.240]   Dopamine is involved in motivation, craving,
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.220]   it creates a sense of wellbeing, it increases energy.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:05.220]   Again, typically only at the beginning of alcohol exposure.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.860]   That occurs in most people as a sharp spike,
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:08.680]   as an increase.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.040]   Again, if somebody does not have alcohol dehydrogenase
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.520]   or has very low levels of the enzyme
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.420]   that convert that acetaldehyde into acetate
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.060]   and metabolize alcohol, in other words,
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.260]   they will feel sick and lousy
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.420]   in a way that will override any recognition
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.400]   of the dopamine release.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.160]   They're going to be the people that are listening to this
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.100]   and just think alcohol just makes me feel sick.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.200]   I don't like it.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.300]   Okay, that's a specific subcategory of people,
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:35.020]   but most people experience some sort of mild euphoria.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.660]   That's why so many people drink, right?
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.620]   The current estimates are that in most countries
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:40.020]   and certainly in the US,
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:44.060]   as many as 80% of the adult legal drinking age population
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:45.060]   drinks alcohol.
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.900]   And that number could be even higher now
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.280]   because in the last couple of years
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.380]   there's been a trend towards increased alcohol consumption,
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:54.160]   especially in the wake of the pandemic
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.780]   and during the pandemic topic for another time.
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:59.420]   So there's an increase in dopamine
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.180]   and an increase in serotonin.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.800]   So it's kind of an increase in wellbeing,
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.100]   an increase in mood,
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.860]   but it's a very short-lived increase.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:10.160]   Very soon after and actually triggered by that increase
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:15.160]   is a long and slow reduction in dopamine and serotonin
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.180]   and related molecules and circuits.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.660]   So basically what you're getting is a blip of feel good
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:23.540]   followed by a long, slow arc of feeling not so great,
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.220]   which is why typically people will drink again and again
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.140]   across the night.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:31.780]   The key thing to understand about tolerance
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:34.300]   is that with tolerance,
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.980]   the duration of that long, slow reduction
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:42.140]   in dopamine and serotonin gets even longer.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.640]   In other words, the negative effects of alcohol
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.840]   that happen after the initial feeling good
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:51.260]   extend longer and in fact get more robust.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:55.480]   However, there's also a reduction
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.300]   in the reinforcing properties of alcohol.
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.200]   There's a shrinking of the feel good blip
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.660]   that happens when one first ingests alcohol.
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:04.820]   And this has been measured in animals and humans.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:06.860]   So the first drink that somebody has,
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.360]   provided they have enough alcohol dehydrogenase
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.820]   that doesn't make them feel nauseous and sick right away,
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.800]   they feel really good.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.780]   And then as it wears off, they feel kind of lousy
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.700]   and they want to drink more, so they might drink more.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.780]   With each subsequent drink and even drinks
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:23.480]   on different nights or even different weeks,
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:26.740]   the amount of dopamine that's released is reduced.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:29.140]   The amount of serotonin that's released is reduced.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.540]   So what you're getting is less and less
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:34.540]   of the reinforcing properties of alcohol,
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:37.320]   the feel good stuff, and more and more
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.940]   of the punishment pain signal aspects of alcohol.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:44.940]   This is the contour of chemical release in the brain
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.980]   that was referred to by my colleague,
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.440]   the incredible Dr. Anna Lemke, who's a medical doctor.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.340]   She wrote the incredible book, "Dopamine Nation."
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.840]   She was a guest on this podcast, on Joe Rogan's podcast,
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.560]   on Rich Roll's podcast, and several other podcasts.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.400]   World expert in addiction and she talked about
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.080]   this pleasure pain balance that extends beyond alcohol
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:07.260]   to things like sex and gambling and to other behaviors
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:08.980]   that can potentially become addictive,
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.200]   but certainly includes alcohol.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.580]   So tolerance, it seems, is a process in which people
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.940]   are ingesting more and more alcohol as an attempt
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:22.480]   to get that feeling of wellbeing back,
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.860]   but what they're really getting is an extended period
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:28.520]   of punishment, of pain, and of malaise from the alcohol.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.940]   Now you might say, well, how does that relate to tolerance?
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.340]   Well, it turns out what they do behaviorally,
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.940]   and when I say they, I mean, animals do this
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:37.980]   and humans do this, is they start drinking more and more
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.580]   in an attempt to activate those dopamine
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:43.880]   and serotonin neurons and receptors.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.380]   And as they do that, there is an increase
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.660]   in alcohol dehydrogenase.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.460]   So the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is increased
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:53.420]   because the body and liver have to contend
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.940]   with all that alcohol.
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:57.020]   So now you've got, again, the two hit model.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.740]   You're getting less of the feel good chemicals,
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:02.120]   more of the negative chemical release or pattern
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:05.060]   of subjective feeling, I should say,
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:09.020]   and you're metabolizing alcohol more quickly
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.860]   and more readily, but it's not taking you
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.180]   to a better place in terms of how you feel.
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.320]   That's one of the major underlying reasons
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.580]   for what we call tolerance.
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.380]   So if you're somebody who drinks and you notice
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:21.320]   that the feeling that you are seeking with alcohol
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:26.320]   is now requiring an additional drink or drinks, plural,
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.220]   chances are you are disrupting the dopamine
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:31.720]   and serotonergic systems of your brain,
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.780]   and you are doing that in a way
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:37.220]   that is increasing the pain and punishment signals
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:40.220]   that follow alcohol ingestion.
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.520]   And again, that's not just on the night
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.700]   that you're drinking, but afterwards as well.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:44.820]   Is that all bad news?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.680]   Well, pretty much, but the good news is
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.860]   that if you abstain from drinking for some period of time,
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.820]   then of course these systems reset.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.500]   How long you need to abstain will depend
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.680]   on how much you were drinking
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.840]   and how long you were drinking for.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.980]   Certainly people who have alcohol use disorder
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:01.380]   who are alcoholics, their main goal should be
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:02.780]   to quit alcohol completely.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.340]   I know there's some debate about this,
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.780]   and I don't want to get into that debate
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.420]   because I'm certainly not going to try
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.580]   and direct anyone's recovery.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:12.420]   There are expert counselors and MDs
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.820]   and people that can work with people.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.900]   In fact, for some very heavy drinkers
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.020]   and people with serious alcohol use disorder
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.500]   going cold turkey, that is stopping drinking completely
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.500]   can actually be medically dangerous.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.500]   So the path to sobriety for certain people
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.780]   looks different than the path to sobriety for other people.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.620]   What I'm referring to here are people
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:31.900]   that are ingesting again somewhere between,
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.620]   on average, one to two drinks per night,
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.460]   whether or not that's done night to night
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:39.180]   or whether or not that's condensed to weekend use.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.140]   I know a number of people are going to ask,
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:45.060]   perhaps are screaming, is drinking good for me in any way?
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.020]   For instance, many people have probably heard
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.360]   that resveratrol is good for people
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.100]   and that red wine is enriched in resveratrol.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:55.300]   I hate to break it to you, but the reality is that
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.360]   if indeed resveratrol is good for us,
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.620]   and there's some debate about this,
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.200]   some people say strongly yes, some people say no,
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.340]   other people say maybe the amount of red wine
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:06.100]   that one would have to drink
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.940]   in order to get enough resveratrol
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:10.260]   in order for it to be health promoting
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.120]   is so outrageously high that it would surely
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.440]   induce other negative effects
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.280]   that would offset the positive effects of resveratrol.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.740]   So I wish I could tell you different.
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:22.440]   Again, I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news,
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.500]   but the statement I just made was confirmed
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.580]   by Dr. David Sinclair when he was a guest on this podcast.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.620]   It's confirmed by other researchers
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:32.280]   who work on resveratrol and related pathways.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.400]   I wish I could tell you that red wine
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.420]   is good for your health.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:39.300]   And indeed it might be through some other mechanisms.
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:40.940]   So for instance, there have been studies
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:44.240]   of low to moderate red wine consumption.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.420]   This would be anywhere from one to four glasses per week.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.180]   And I don't mean enormous glasses,
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.140]   I mean six ounce glasses of red wine.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:56.740]   And in those cases, some of the stress reduction
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:59.260]   that can be induced by consumption of red wine
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:02.480]   may be some of the other micronutrients and components
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.500]   within red wines, in particular red wines
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.900]   that come from particular grapes,
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.420]   and this gets really nuanced and frankly is not well worked
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.580]   out in the peer reviewed literature,
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.660]   certainly not clinical trials,
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.780]   at least not that I'm aware of.
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.460]   Tell me if you're aware of a great clinical trial on this.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.160]   Well, there may be some positive effects
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.260]   of that very low level of consumption.
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.340]   I'm not trying to take away anybody's red wine.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:27.540]   I'm not trying to take away anybody's anything.
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:31.980]   I would be remiss, however, if I didn't tell you
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.240]   that resveratrol as the argument for drinking
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.060]   and drinking red wine in particular is just not a good one.
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.180]   It's just not supported by the peer reviewed research.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.620]   A few other things about alcohol and health.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:46.860]   The beginning of the episode,
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:49.860]   I referenced a study showing that indeed
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.960]   not just heavy alcohol consumption
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.660]   of 12 to 24 more drinks per week,
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.540]   but also light to moderate alcohol consumption
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:59.740]   of any type, wine, beer, spirits, et cetera,
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:03.240]   does reduce the thickness of the brain.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.260]   It really does reduce cortical thickness.
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.420]   In fact, it actually scales with the amount of alcohol
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:10.500]   that people drink.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.780]   And this has been well-documented
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:13.820]   in a number of different studies.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:16.120]   I can provide a link to several of these.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.780]   One of the more striking ones actually shows
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:21.320]   that there's almost a dose dependent increase
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.300]   in shrinkage of the gray matter volume
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.700]   and in these white matter tracks,
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.940]   these axons, these wires as it would,
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:29.820]   that connect different neurons
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:31.540]   as a function of how much alcohol people drink.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:34.100]   And that's also what's been seen in this recent study
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.180]   that I referenced at the beginning
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:36.960]   and that's in the show note captions.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.040]   So again, probably the best amount of alcohol to drink
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.620]   would be zero glasses per week or ounces per week.
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.680]   For those of you drinking low amounts of alcohol,
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.940]   make sure you're doing other things to promote your health.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:51.780]   And for those of you that are drinking moderate,
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:53.720]   and certainly for those of you that are heavy drinkers,
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.520]   please do everything you can to move away from that
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.020]   and to quit entirely.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:01.520]   But even for the moderate consumers of alcohol,
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.940]   you are going to want to be aware
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.140]   of some of the negative health effects
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:06.640]   and do things to offset those
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.180]   if indeed you're not going to stop drinking
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.480]   or reduce your intake.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:12.960]   One of the really bad effects of alcohol,
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.580]   but that's extremely well-documented,
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.220]   is the fact that alcohol,
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.960]   because of this toxicity of acetaldehyde
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.420]   and related pathways, can alter DNA methylation.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:26.180]   It can alter gene expression.
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:28.620]   That can be many things in different tissues,
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:33.620]   but it is associated with a significant increase
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:36.420]   in cancer risk, in particular breast cancer.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.980]   And in particular, because breast tissue
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:40.500]   is present in both males and females,
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:43.360]   but in women, it's especially vulnerable
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.820]   to some of the DNA methylation changes.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:48.060]   Well, breast cancer in women
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.820]   has a relationship to alcohol intake
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.300]   and alcohol intake has a relationship
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.060]   to breast cancer in women.
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:56.540]   In fact, there has been proposed to be
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:01.100]   anywhere from four to 13% increase
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:03.080]   in risk of breast cancer
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.900]   for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.140]   How much is 10 grams?
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.740]   Well, there we need to think a little bit
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.600]   about the variation in the amount of alcohol
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.260]   in different drinks across the world.
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.140]   Different countries serve different sized drinks
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.700]   and have different concentrations of alcohol
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:16.700]   in those drinks.
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.960]   So without going down too much of a rabbit hole
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.800]   and just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with,
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.020]   there have been studies of the percentage of alcohol
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.080]   included in different drinks
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.440]   and the sizes of different drinks
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.620]   that are served in different countries.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.740]   And here's a kind of a patchwork of those findings.
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:37.220]   In Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.080]   or one shot of liquor as it's served there
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.740]   tends to include anywhere from seven to eight grams
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.180]   of alcohol.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:47.240]   In the US, one beer, which generally is 12 ounces.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.320]   If it's in a bottle,
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.680]   one glass of wine or a shot of liquor
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:57.680]   tends to include about 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.200]   And in Russia,
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.660]   one drink of the various sorts that I just described
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:09.040]   typically will have as much as 24 grams of alcohol
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.780]   because of the differences in the concentration of alcohols
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.600]   and the sizes of drinks
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.820]   that are poured in these different countries, okay?
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:18.200]   Of course, there are other countries in the world
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.900]   those countries are also vitally important,
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.700]   but those are the ones that extracted from the studies
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:23.660]   that I could find.
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:26.020]   What does this mean?
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.560]   Well, what we're talking about is that
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.940]   for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.500]   so that's one beer in the US,
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.900]   maybe a little bit more than one beer in Japan,
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.900]   or basically a third of a drink in Russia,
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:43.900]   there's a four to 13% increase in risk of cancer.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.600]   That's pretty outrageous, right?
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:49.340]   And you might think, wait, how could it be that
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:50.620]   this stuff is even legal?
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.020]   Well, look, as I described before, it's a toxin.
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.140]   It's also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:00.420]   I mean, in the US, at least they tried prohibition
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:02.300]   that certainly did lead,
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:06.820]   yes, did lead to a reduction in alcohol-induced
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.500]   health disorders, in particular cirrhosis of the liver.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.180]   It also led to a lot of crime
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.980]   because it became a substance
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:15.020]   that a lot of people still wanted
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.220]   and that people were willing to break the law
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.780]   in order to provide, or I should say to sell and provide.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:24.200]   But the point is that the more alcohol people drink,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.500]   the greater their increase of cancer,
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.620]   in particular breast cancer.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:31.060]   And that's because of the fact that alcohol
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:33.460]   has these effects on cells
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:36.540]   that include changes in gene expression.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:39.380]   And cancer, that is the growth of tumors,
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.160]   is a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.520]   A tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation,
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.560]   aggregation is stuff sticking together, by the way.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.160]   Proliferation is stuff duplicating.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.960]   A proliferation and aggregation of cells
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:56.720]   that could be a glioma, glial cells, glioma, brain tumor,
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.640]   it could be lymphoma, so within the lymph tissue, et cetera.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.960]   The mutations that alcohol induces to cause this
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.260]   are wide ranging.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.240]   Some of those are starting to start to be understood.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.960]   For those of you that are interested in cell biology,
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.480]   I'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.160]   again, this is super specialized
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:17.180]   and for the aficionados only, you don't need to know this.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:19.280]   The PD-1 pathway seems to be upregulated.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.840]   And we knew this from the discussion earlier,
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.460]   there's a downregulation
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:27.760]   in some of the anti-inflammatory molecules
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.360]   that help suppress this proliferation of cancers.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.320]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in the fact
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.360]   that the immune system is constantly combating cancers
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.920]   that exist in us all the time.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.200]   Little tumors start growing and our immune system
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.660]   goes and gobbles them up.
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.020]   Little tumors start growing,
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.880]   the immune system senses inflammation,
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.300]   sends out these incredible cells,
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:50.260]   these killers B cells and T cells and beats them up.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:55.160]   Cancers proliferate and take hold and cause serious problems
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.260]   when the proliferation of cells
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.000]   exceeds the immune system's ability to gobble up
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:00.920]   and remove those cells.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.920]   There are other mechanisms of regulating cancers,
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.240]   but that's one of the primary one.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.240]   And alcohol hits it, again, it's a two hit model.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.340]   It increases tumor growth and it decreases
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:15.280]   the sorts of molecules that suppress and combat tumor growth.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.720]   So again, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.660]   can be problematic for sake of cancers,
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:22.320]   in particular breast cancers.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.640]   Epidemiologists and health specialists love to try
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.680]   and compare different substances
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.260]   in terms of how bad they are.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.280]   Rarely do they compare substances
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.700]   in terms of how good they are, but sometimes they do.
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:38.020]   And what they'll sometimes tell you
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:39.340]   and what you can find in the literature
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:42.620]   is that ingesting 10 to 15 grams of alcohol a day,
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.380]   so that would be like one beer in the US,
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:45.460]   one glass of wine,
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:48.500]   is the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:53.020]   Frankly, it's hard to make that direct relationship
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:56.020]   really stick because it's a question of
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.240]   how long people inhale,
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.580]   do they have a predisposition to a lung cancer, et cetera.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:03.420]   But even if that number is off
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:06.660]   by plus or minus two cigarettes,
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:09.540]   or even if that number with the equivalent
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:12.260]   of one glass of wine equals one cigarette per day,
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:14.440]   I think there's general consensus now
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.500]   that nicotine consumed by vaping or by cigarette,
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:22.540]   it's bad for us in terms of lung cancer
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.020]   and other forms of cancer.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.500]   And for some reason, I don't know why,
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.400]   because this knowledge about alcohol and cancer
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.660]   and these established relationships
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.880]   have been known since the late 1980s.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:36.220]   The first kind of landmark paper on this
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.620]   was published in 1987.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:38.800]   I can provide a link to that paper.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.820]   It's actually quite interesting to read.
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:45.240]   Well, the relationship is there
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:47.460]   and yet we don't often hear about it, right?
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:49.560]   In fact, before researching this episode,
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.960]   I had heard before that alcohol can increase cancer risk,
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.020]   but I wasn't aware of just how strong
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.280]   that relationship is.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:58.800]   Because of the serious nature of what we're talking about
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:01.780]   and because I would hate to be confusing
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.180]   or misleading to anybody,
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.760]   I wanted to just emphasize that this statistic
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.860]   that there is a 4 to 13%,
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.280]   depending on which study you look at,
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:12.460]   a 4 to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:13.680]   in particular breast cancer,
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:17.200]   for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.740]   that's 10 grams per day.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.800]   So that's one drink per day.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.960]   But I do want to emphasize
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.160]   that if that equates to seven drinks per week
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.800]   and all those seven drinks are being consumed
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.160]   on Friday and Saturday,
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.800]   it still averages to 10 grams per day.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.140]   And I also want to emphasize
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.080]   that there are things that people can do
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:38.720]   to at least partially offset
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.880]   some of the negative effects of alcohol
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:43.320]   as it relates to predisposition
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.120]   to the formation of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.480]   I also want to be clear before I say it
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.980]   that doing the things I'm about to tell you
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.760]   is not a guarantee that you're not going to get cancer,
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:58.640]   nor is it a guarantee that alcohol
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:02.420]   is not going to lead to an increased predisposition
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.880]   for certain kinds of cancers.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.220]   And the two things are consumption of folate
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:10.400]   and other B vitamins, especially B12.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.320]   You know, the consumption of folate and B12
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:16.980]   has been shown to decrease cancer risk
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.180]   in people that ingest alcohol,
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:21.500]   but not completely offset it.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.420]   Why that is isn't exactly clear.
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.960]   It probably has something to do with the relationship
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.800]   between folate and B12 and other B vitamins
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.140]   in gene regulation pathways that can lead to tumor growth.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:37.100]   At some point soon, we will get an expert in cancer biology
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:40.800]   and in particular in breast cancer biology on the program,
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.400]   and we can ask them about this,
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.180]   but I realize this is going to raise a number of questions
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.360]   and maybe even cause some of you to go out there
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.760]   and start taking folate and other B vitamins and B12.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.680]   Not incidentally, a lot of the reported
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.340]   hangover supplements and treatments include folate and B12.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.840]   I don't know if they had the cancer literature in mind
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:06.040]   when they created those supplements and products.
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.880]   I doubt they did.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.220]   Alcohol really does disrupt B vitamin pathways,
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:14.240]   both synthesis pathways and utilization pathways.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.780]   So sometimes you'll hear, oh, you know,
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:16.780]   if you get your B vitamins,
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.280]   it helps you recover from hangover more quickly.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:22.460]   Again, the literature doesn't support that,
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.560]   but also again, there aren't a lot of studies,
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.080]   but more to the point as it relates to alcohol
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.040]   and the formation of tumors and cancers,
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.120]   it does appear that decreased folate
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.760]   and other B vitamins like B12 are partially responsible
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.940]   for the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:45.240]   And it does appear that consuming adequate amounts
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.360]   of folate and B12 might, again,
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.620]   might partially, really want to bold face and underline
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:54.320]   and highlight, partially offset some of that increased risk.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.720]   There's an additional category
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.160]   that I want to highlight, of course,
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:01.200]   and this is vitally important to state,
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.580]   even though it's obvious,
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:05.400]   which is that people who are pregnant
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:09.080]   should absolutely not consume alcohol.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.240]   Fetal alcohol syndrome is well-known and established.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.320]   It's terrible.
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:18.160]   Fetuses experience diminished brain development
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.100]   that's often permanent, diminished limb development,
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:23.040]   diminished organ development in the periphery,
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.640]   meaning the heart, the lungs, the liver, et cetera.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.840]   Ingesting alcohol while pregnant is simply a bad idea.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.840]   And the reason I say this at all is,
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.280]   first of all, it's important to include
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.240]   in an episode like this,
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.920]   but also because we can look at two things.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.400]   First of all, we can look at mechanism
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.000]   and then we can also look at some of the lore
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.920]   that still sadly exists out there.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.400]   Let's take care of the lore that sadly exists first.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.760]   If you look online,
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.440]   you will sometimes be able to find, sadly,
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.520]   that some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.360]   are not detrimental to fetuses.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.480]   They'll say, well, champagne is safe
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.320]   for a pregnant mother to drink, but beer is not.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.400]   That is absolutely categorically false.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.300]   Alcohol is alcohol.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:12.000]   There is no evidence whatsoever
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.720]   that consuming certain types of alcohol
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.560]   is safer for fetuses than others.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:16.640]   Alcohol is a toxin,
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.140]   and the reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:21.980]   is because the ability of that toxin
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:24.160]   to disrupt cellular processes.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:27.300]   Remember tumor growth and the way that alcohol
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.740]   can accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells,
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.560]   the wrong cells, the ones you don't want to proliferate?
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.380]   Well, all of embryonic development,
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.340]   all of fetal development, it's not the growth of a tumor,
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.940]   it's obviously the growth of an embryo,
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.440]   and it's done in a very orchestrated way.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.100]   I started off studying brain development.
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.720]   That's where I got my beginnings in neurobiology,
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.680]   and I still teach embryology to medical students
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.440]   and graduate students.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:55.080]   The set of coordinated processes
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.280]   that has to take place from conception to birth
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.440]   in order to give rise to a healthy embryo
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.440]   is so dynamically controlled and so exquisitely precise
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.940]   with checkpoints and recovery mechanisms
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.360]   and redundancy in the genes that are expressed
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.920]   to make sure that if anything goes wrong,
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:13.720]   it's repaired, et cetera.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:17.640]   Alcohol as a mutagen, I haven't used that word yet,
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.040]   but a substance that can mutate DNA
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.120]   through alterations in DNA methylation
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.280]   and these checkpoints in the cell cycle.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:29.300]   Alcohol as a mutagen is one of the worst things
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:31.680]   that a developing embryo can be exposed to.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:34.880]   And again, because it's water-soluble and fat-soluble,
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.680]   ingestion of alcohol when people are pregnant
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.040]   passes right to the fetus.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.540]   Now, I realize that a number of people out there
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:42.920]   might be thinking, "Oh goodness, you know,
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.120]   I didn't realize I was pregnant
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.900]   until a certain stage of pregnancy,
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:50.080]   and before I realized I was ingesting alcohol."
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.900]   Obviously, one can't undo what's been done,
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:57.180]   but I want to also emphasize that fetal alcohol syndrome,
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:59.520]   while yes, there's a full-blown syndrome
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:02.080]   that manifests as changes in the craniofacial development
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.920]   that are very obvious, and you can look these up,
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.080]   you've probably seen these before,
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.720]   the pictures before, rather.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.680]   It has to do with eye spacing, forehead size,
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:11.700]   a number of other features of the craniofacial development,
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.600]   and of course, stuff's going on in the brain too.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.600]   It's along a continuum, so it is possible
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.040]   that some of the changes that occur are more minor,
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.680]   and thankfully, the young brain,
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.520]   in particular the early postnatal brain,
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.600]   is incredibly plastic.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.780]   There are things that can be done
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:28.780]   in order to help recover neural circuits
[01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:31.780]   that didn't develop well, et cetera.
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:34.920]   But even though it's somewhat obvious
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.600]   or should be obvious, I really want to make clear
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.020]   that there's zero evidence whatsoever
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.860]   that certain forms of alcohol are safer
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:42.400]   for pregnant women to ingest than others.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.600]   It's absolutely wrong.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.960]   No one who's pregnant should be ingesting alcohol whatsoever,
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:51.720]   and certainly, if people feel like they can't avoid alcohol
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.080]   while pregnant, they really need to work with somebody
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.920]   to make sure that it just absolutely doesn't happen
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.840]   because it is so detrimental to the developing fetus.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.380]   Lastly, I want to talk about the effects
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:03.880]   of alcohol on hormones, and I want to distinguish
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.400]   between low amounts of alcohol intake,
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.000]   higher amounts of alcohol intake,
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.920]   and again, this chronic alcohol intake
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.560]   versus occasional use versus really chronic use,
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:16.560]   meaning alcoholic or alcoholic use disorder
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:18.320]   where people are drinking an immense amount
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.380]   on an ongoing basis.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.140]   The literature on alcohol and hormones is quite extensive,
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:23.980]   and there are, of course,
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:25.360]   many, many different types of hormones.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.000]   The hormones that most often get mentioned
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.440]   and talked about on this podcast are the hormones testosterone
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.080]   and estrogen, which are present in both men and women,
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:37.140]   in both men and women are important for things like libido.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:40.320]   They're also responsible for sexual development,
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.520]   actual development of the genitalia
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.920]   before birth and after birth.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.200]   They're responsible, for instance,
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.360]   estrogen is important for memory and cognition.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.840]   You never want to drop estrogen too low in men or women
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.840]   'cause it can disrupt cognition and joint health, et cetera.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.820]   To keep this discussion relatively constrained,
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:52:00.080]   it's fair to say that alcohol, and in particular,
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.320]   the toxic metabolites of alcohol,
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:07.640]   increase the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.620]   Now, this occurs in a number of different tissues.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:12.720]   This is not just occurring in the testes of males.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.320]   This is occurring in lots of different tissues,
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.380]   and I'll refer you to a excellent review.
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.280]   We'll provide a link in the show note captions.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.280]   This is a paper that was published in the year 2000,
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.640]   but the data are still quite strong.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.680]   The journal is called, of all things, Alcohol.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:31.120]   There's, yes, literally a journal called Alcohol
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.560]   for the publication of data and reviews
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:34.900]   on alcohol and its effects.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.000]   And the title of the paper is,
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.240]   Can Alcohol Promote Aromatization of Androgens to Estrogens?
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.640]   Aromatization is this process of the conversion
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:44.600]   of testosterone and other androgens to estrogens
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.720]   through things like aromatase enzyme.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.760]   And this is a beautiful review that describes every tissue
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:54.800]   or near every tissue from the ovary in females
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.420]   to the placenta, to the liver, to the testes,
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:02.900]   in which alcohol can increase the aromatization
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:04.040]   of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.640]   Now, in females, this may be part of the reason
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:09.720]   why there's an increase in estrogen-related cancers.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.040]   Breast cancer can be either estrogen-related
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.120]   or non-estrogen-related.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.920]   There are other types of estrogen-related cancers
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.720]   outside of breast cancer,
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:19.600]   but it appears that one reason why alcohol increases
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.920]   the risk of breast cancer is because of this aromatization
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:26.560]   from, of testosterone, excuse me, to estrogen.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:31.560]   In males, accelerated or abnormal conversion
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.100]   of testosterone to estrogen can actually lead to growth
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:37.280]   of the breast tissue in males, so-called gynecomastia,
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.800]   or other effects of high estrogen,
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:43.280]   or I should say of altered testosterone-estrogen ratios,
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.400]   'cause that's really what's important.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:48.840]   And these can include things like diminished sex drive,
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:51.560]   increased fat storage, and a number of other things
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.300]   that I think most people would find to be negative effects.
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:58.640]   I once talked about the fact that drinking alcohol
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:01.220]   can increase the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:03.560]   I posted that online, and I didn't get attacked,
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:07.560]   but I did get criticized for the fact
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.940]   that it has been shown, yes, has been shown,
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.800]   that small amounts of alcohol ingestion,
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:14.120]   so five grams or so of alcohol ingestion,
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.400]   this would be half a glass of wine or half a glass of beer,
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.740]   at least in some studies showed increases in testosterone,
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.160]   which was kind of surprising,
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.840]   but I should point out other studies have shown
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.720]   that alcohol ingestion causes decreases
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.160]   in testosterone over time.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:30.640]   So there's always this issue
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.640]   of whether or not you're looking at a study
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.840]   of acute exposure versus chronic exposure,
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:37.040]   one dose versus multiple doses and exposure.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.540]   I think it's fair to say,
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:41.000]   based on my read of the literature,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.700]   this review and other reviews
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.040]   that focus more particularly on humans,
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.200]   that regular ingestion of alcohol
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.540]   is going to increase estrogen levels,
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:50.880]   whether or not you're male or female,
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:54.200]   and it's largely doing that through the aromatization process
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.360]   by increasing the aromatase enzyme.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.040]   Yes, there's some dose dependence,
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.440]   but I think if you're somebody who's trying
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:03.240]   to optimize your testosterone to estrogen ratio,
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.300]   regardless of whether or not you're male or female,
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.880]   well, then most certainly you're going to want
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:09.440]   to avoid drinking too much alcohol.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.840]   So we've covered a lot of topics and data
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.760]   related to the mechanisms of alcohol,
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:18.160]   hangover, tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.960]   I acknowledge that I've mainly talked to you
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.940]   about the negative effects of alcohol.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:26.560]   I want to acknowledge that many people enjoy alcohol
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.120]   in moderation or even light drinking,
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:32.720]   the occasional drink or the occasional two drinks,
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:35.380]   or maybe even on average, one drink per night,
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.100]   so seven drinks per week.
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.140]   I'm certainly not here to tell you what to do
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:40.760]   and what not to do.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.660]   I do find it immensely interesting, however,
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:46.760]   that first of all, alcohol is a known toxin
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:47.920]   to the cells of the body.
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:49.080]   Some of you might immediately say,
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:50.520]   well, wait, what about hormesis?
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:51.960]   What about this phenomenon where
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:54.760]   if we regularly ingest a toxin, it makes us stronger?
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.120]   In other words, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.760]   There's some reason to believe that might be beneficial
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:04.040]   in terms of some forms of cellular resilience,
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:07.640]   maybe, maybe, no, sorry, it doesn't work that way.
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.880]   There are processes of hormesis in which, for instance,
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:14.680]   exposing yourself safely to increases in adrenaline
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:17.800]   through ice baths or other things that increase adrenaline
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:20.080]   can raise your so-called stress threshold.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.720]   But here we're talking about cellular stress
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.760]   and damage to cells.
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:27.920]   So my read of the literature, and again, this is my read,
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.800]   and I invite others to provide studies
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.240]   or I would prefer actually collections of studies
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:35.880]   that point in the direction, if they exist,
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.080]   that alcohol can be beneficial.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.340]   But my read of the literature, or I should say,
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.040]   my understanding of what I would call the center of mass
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:49.640]   of the literature on alcohol is that no consumption,
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.840]   zero consumption, consumption of zero ounces of alcohol
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.980]   is going to be better for your health
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:59.120]   than low to moderate consumption of alcohol.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.340]   And that low to moderate consumption of alcohol
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:04.360]   is going to be better for you, of course,
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:08.480]   than moderately high to high alcohol consumption
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.260]   on the order of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.660]   I realize that for most people listening to this,
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:19.680]   it's probably low to moderate alcohol consumption
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.040]   that is part of their standard repertoire.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.360]   And I'm not here to give you justification for doing that,
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.360]   nor am I going to tell you not to do that.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.540]   I would like you to consider perhaps, however,
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.920]   the negative effects that we understand
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:34.800]   and that are documented.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:37.560]   For instance, the negative effects of alcohol
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.480]   in the gut microbiome and the things that you can do
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.560]   to better support your gut microbiome.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.000]   The negative effects on the stress system,
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.140]   that HPA axis that we talked about earlier,
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.580]   and the fact that even low to moderate levels
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:52.080]   of alcohol consumption can increase our levels of stress
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:53.880]   when we're not drinking.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.320]   And to think about acquiring some tools
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.080]   and getting some proficiency with tools,
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:01.140]   behavioral or otherwise,
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.280]   that can help you with stress modulation
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.120]   that don't involve alcohol consumption.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.000]   Again, the point here is to illustrate
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.080]   where the problems lie with alcohol consumption,
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:13.800]   but also what I've tried to do is to point you
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.780]   to some resources that can help offset
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:17.320]   some of those negative effects.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.400]   Will they offset all the effects?
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.940]   I can't say that for sure,
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:24.000]   but certainly taking measures
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.560]   to offset some of the negative effects
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:26.760]   of any alcohol consumption
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:29.640]   that you might be having or doing
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.520]   is going to be beneficial to you.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:32.740]   And those tools and protocols
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:34.720]   are going to be health promoting in any case.

[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.720]   and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:25.040]   And both places I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.640]   some of which overlap with the content
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:27.800]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:30.020]   but much of which is unique from the content
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:31.560]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.240]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:34.920]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.800]   Please also check out our neural network monthly newsletter.
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:41.320]   This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.600]   It also includes a lot of actionable protocols.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:45.640]   It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.800]   You go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.880]   go to newsletter, you supply your email,
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:51.880]   but we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.780]   We have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy,
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:57.000]   which is we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.520]   And the newsletter comes out once a month
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:01.040]   and it is completely zero cost.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.080]   Again, just go to HubermanLab.com
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:05.520]   and go to the neural network newsletter.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:07.840]   I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:09.040]   has a clips channel.
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:13.400]   So these are brief clips, anywhere from three to 10 minutes
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:16.960]   that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:20.140]   related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.
[02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:21.520]   We talk about things like caffeine,
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.640]   when to drink caffeine relative to sleep, alcohol,
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:26.600]   when and how and if anyone should ingest it
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.280]   relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health,
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:31.860]   physical health, and on and on,
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:33.820]   all the things that relate to the topics
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:35.160]   most of interest to you.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:37.840]   You can find that easily by going to YouTube,
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:40.760]   look for Huberman Lab Clips in the search area,
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:42.320]   and it will take you there, subscribe,
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:44.640]   and we are constantly updating those with new clips.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.200]   This is especially useful, I believe,
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:48.200]   for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.820]   or you're still working through the back catalog
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:50.920]   of Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.040]   which admittedly can be rather long.
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.320]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:57.120]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.700]   [upbeat music]
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:02.280]   (upbeat music)
