[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   This week on the podcast we're joined by Dr. Don Whitney, the professor of Biblical
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.640]   Spirituality and associate dean of the School of Theology at the Southern
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.920]   Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville. Don is well known for writing
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.600]   his classic book, Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life, which was
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.320]   originally published in 1991 and then revised and expanded in 2014 to its
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.000]   present form. Don is also the author of a new book from Crossway and that
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.720]   book is titled Praying the Bible. We'll talk more about that book later on.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.280]   Dr. Whitney, thank you for your time. It is a great privilege and honor to be on
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.800]   the podcast, Tony. Thank you for having me. Certainly. We're happy to have you
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.400]   here. 2016 is here and with a new year brings renewed interest in
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.720]   disciplines and particularly the spiritual disciplines. January 1st
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   is a good date to sort of reset our spiritual practices. I want to ask you
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.760]   five of the most common questions that we get on spiritual disciplines and I
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.120]   know that these are questions that you've heard as well. And so we're going
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.040]   to start our time together broadly with this first question. In general, what are
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.400]   the spiritual disciplines? How do you define them? The spiritual
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.200]   disciplines are those practices found in Scripture that promote spiritual growth
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.520]   among believers in the gospel of Jesus Christ. They're habits of devotion, habits
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   of experiential Christianity that have been practiced by God's people since
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.120]   biblical times. I describe them in several ways. Five or six things as a
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.520]   part of that description. First, the Bible prescribes both personal and
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.400]   interpersonal spiritual disciplines. There are those spiritual disciplines
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.240]   that we practice alone and those that we practice with other Christians. So for
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   example, we're to pray alone, that's a personal spiritual discipline. We're also
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   to pray with the church, that's an interpersonal or congregational
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.760]   spiritual discipline. We're to practice both because Jesus practiced both. We
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.600]   could give examples in Scripture from that. And because the Bible prescribes
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.200]   both of those for us. So we don't want to think of spirituality and the spiritual
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.760]   disciplines just as something we do by ourselves. We also are to engage others
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.480]   in the practice of the spiritual disciplines. A second characteristic of
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.680]   the spiritual disciplines is that they are activities, they are not attitudes.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.040]   Disciplines are practices. Spiritual disciplines are things you do. They're
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.000]   not character qualities, they're not graces, they're not the fruit of the
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.520]   Spirit, they're things you do. So you read the Bible, that's something you do, that's
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.440]   a spiritual discipline. You meditate on Scripture, you pray fast, worship, serve,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.200]   learn, and so forth. These are activities. Now the goal of practicing any given
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.280]   discipline, of course, is not about doing as much as it is about being. Being like
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.000]   Jesus, being with Jesus. But the biblical way to grow and being more like Jesus is
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.500]   through the rightly motivated doing of the biblical spiritual disciplines. The
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.600]   key verse in all this, 1st Timothy 4:7, which says, "Discipline yourself for the
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.480]   purpose of godliness." The goal is godliness, but the means to that, the
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.520]   biblical means, is to discipline yourself. By the power of the Holy Spirit, rightly
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.480]   motivated, we're to discipline ourselves for the purpose of godliness. Well, those
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.760]   practical ways of doing that are things that you do. So strictly speaking, joy is
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.200]   not a spiritual discipline. That's the fruit or the result of discipline done
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.520]   rightly. So it is that distinction between doing and being, and the
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.160]   spiritual disciplines are about doing. You can do them as a Pharisee, you can do
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.980]   them wrongly motivated, but rightly motivated, they are things that we are to
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.280]   do in order to be like Jesus, to be with Jesus. A third descriptor of the
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.680]   spiritual disciplines is that we're talking about things that are biblical.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.160]   Practice is taught or modeled in the Bible. The reason that's important is
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.920]   that otherwise we leave ourselves open to calling anything we want a spiritual
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.040]   discipline. So someone might say, "Well, you know, gardening is a spiritual
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.000]   discipline for me," or "Exercise is one of my spiritual disciplines," or any other
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.480]   really hobby or pleasurable habit they could call a spiritual discipline. But
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.400]   one of the problems with that is that could tempt someone to say, "Well, you know,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.880]   maybe meditation on Scripture works for you, but gardening does just as much for
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.560]   my soul as the Bible does for yours." And another result of that is that
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.680]   virtually anything being a spiritual discipline is one problem. The other is
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.480]   that it leaves it to us to determine what will be best for our spiritual
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.640]   health and maturity, rather than accepting those things God has revealed
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.720]   in Scripture as the means of experiencing God and growing in Christ's
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   likeness. A fourth characteristic of spiritual disciplines is that my
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.040]   position is that those found in Scripture are sufficient for knowing
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.200]   and experiencing God and for growing in Christ's likeness. I mean, we're told in
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.960]   that famous verse, 2 Timothy 3, 16 and 17, that all Scripture is breathed out by
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.800]   God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.240]   righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work,
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.440]   including the good work of pursuing the purpose of godliness, the good work of
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.760]   growing in Christ's likeness. The Scriptures are sufficient for that. So
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.520]   whatever else a person might claim regarding the spiritual benefits of some
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.580]   practice that's not in the Bible, something that maybe is promoted by some
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.160]   other spiritual cause or spiritual group or some spiritual leader, that if you'll
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.680]   do this or you'll do that, you will experience God, it'll be very meaningful.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.720]   Well, regardless of whatever benefit someone may claim accrues to them from
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.440]   that practice, at the very least we can say it isn't necessary. If it were
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.560]   necessary for spiritual maturity and godliness and progress and holiness, it
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.840]   would have been found and promoted in the Scriptures. A fifth description of
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.480]   the spiritual disciplines is that they are derived from the gospel, not divorced
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.440]   from the gospel. Rightly practiced, the spiritual disciplines take us deeper
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.640]   into the glories of the gospel of Jesus Christ, not away from it, as though we've
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.280]   moved on to some advanced level of Christianity. So the gospel, well, that's
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.340]   the ABCs, now let's get into the really deep things of God, the spiritual
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.400]   disciplines. No, the spiritual disciplines are derived from the gospel, not
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.080]   divorced from it, and they take us only deeper into an understanding of the
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.280]   gospel. And the last characteristic of the spiritual disciplines is that they
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.480]   are means and not ends. The end, that is the purpose of practicing the
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   disciplines, back to 1st Timothy 4:7, is godliness. Discipline yourself for the
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.620]   purpose of godliness. And so we're not godly just because we practice the
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.520]   spiritual disciplines. That was the great error of the Pharisees. They thought by
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.840]   doing these things, I am godly. No, they are means to godliness. Rightly
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.320]   motivated, they are the means to godliness. Amen. Thank you, Dr. Whitney. And those
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.880]   specific disciplines include Bible intake, and prayer, and musical worship,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.040]   and evangelism, and serving, and stewardship, and fasting, silence and
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   solitude, journaling, and learning. Those are the categories that you develop
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.800]   specifically in your book on the spiritual disciplines. Thank you,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.600]   Dr. Whitney. And tomorrow I want to ask you about the difference between
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.800]   the personal disciplines and the congregational disciplines. I think we
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.200]   we tend to think of spiritual disciplines as personal and private
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   things, but they're not, as you've explained. Not entirely. And we'll be back
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.940]   tomorrow with Dr. Don Whitney to talk about the differences between personal
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.320]   and congregational disciplines. I'm your host Tony Reinke, and I'll see you
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.560]   tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
