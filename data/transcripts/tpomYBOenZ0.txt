[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   Hello and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John with longtime author and pastor John
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120]   Piper.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.560]   John Piper is a pastor, he is a theologian, a preacher, an author, and he is a husband
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.800]   and a dad and a grandfather.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.280]   And today's question is one about being a husband and a dad, specifically a dad to little
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280]   ones.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.440]   The question comes from a perplexed young wife and mom named Mary.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.480]   "Dear Pastor John, my husband and I recently had our first child, a beautiful baby girl.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.680]   She is now seven weeks old.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.480]   My husband, however, doesn't seem to want to help very much with her.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.200]   He never changes diapers and I have to urge him even to hold her.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.240]   He claims that since he works outside of the home, he shouldn't have to take care of her.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.280]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.820]   What role should a Christian husband take in caring for little kids and their needs
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.000]   at home?"
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I think I can paint a faithful, biblical picture of the kinds of things a godly Christian husband
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.140]   should be inclined to do if he is submitted to Scripture and led by the Holy Spirit and
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.780]   trusting the promises of God.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.360]   But I don't mean to imply by this picture that I'm going to paint that every marriage
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.960]   will have the same proportion of activities spread out among a wife and a husband, but
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.360]   rather that these are the kinds of things a man will lean into if he loves Scripture,
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   lives by the Spirit, draws strength from the promises of God.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.120]   And the reason I make that qualification is because if you have a woman who has six kids,
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.280]   a husband who has an eight-hour job, leaves at 8.30, comes home at 5.30, and is sitting
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.580]   most of the day and she's managing six kids, that's going to look different when he comes
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:08.040]   home maybe than if they have one kid and she stays at home and he works 12 hours of labor,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.760]   say in construction all day, and he comes home at 8.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.780]   It's just going to look different.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.680]   But in either of those cases, what I'm about to paint I think is true.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.820]   First, a godly husband will feel a very special responsibility under God to love his wife
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.200]   and children by leading and providing and protecting his wife and his children.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.360]   And the reason I say that is because I see all three of those things describing the kind
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.640]   of love that a husband is supposed to have in Ephesians 5, 25 to 33.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.180]   Number two, the nature of that love for his wife and children includes a self-denying
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.200]   sacrificial inclination to honor and nurture the relationships in his family.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.100]   Paul says in Ephesians 5, 29, "No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.160]   it just as Christ does the church."
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.880]   And that applies primarily to the wife, but his children are by implication also his own
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.200]   flesh, profoundly his own flesh.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:32.220]   So there is built in to Christ-like manhood in marriage a God-given inclination to use
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.400]   strength for the sake of honoring and nurturing wife and children.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:48.960]   Third, since Peter calls the wife the weaker vessel and infers from it not disrespect but
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.080]   greater honor from the husband, 1 Peter 3, 7, it follows that a Christian husband will
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:06.440]   seek to express or expand his strength to support his wife in her burdens rather than
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   calling attention to his own weakness and weariness.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.720]   In other words, the strength of a man in his God-given manhood should incline him to go
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.320]   the extra mile in showing his strength in helping his wife with the children, including
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.500]   changing diapers with his big, strong arms.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.040]   So she will want to go the extra mile as a unique helper fit for him.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:51.480]   This is a beautiful competition in the marriage where both are seeking to outdo one another
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.680]   in showing honor and serving.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:05.020]   Fourth, Paul says in Ephesians 6, 4, "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.260]   bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:19.140]   The application is that fathers have a unique role in displaying the character of the Lord,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.140]   Jesus, and the nature of God the Father to the children.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:34.220]   To be sure, mothers are crucial, essential in showing Christ and Christlikeness to the
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.220]   children.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:45.160]   But the fatherhood of God and the lordship of Jesus is not revealed to us for nothing.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:53.220]   Fathers have a unique role in showing their children what God the Father is like, and
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.340]   what we know is that God the Father helps the very hairs of our head.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.980]   As he numbers them, he gets down nitty gritty, takes one hair at a time, one, two, three,
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.260]   3,002, 3,003, and he counts the hairs on our head, Matthew 10, 30.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.940]   That's a picture of attentiveness and closeness and hands-on care.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.340]   That's the picture in Matthew 10, 30 of our father.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.340]   He knows our frame.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.740]   He remembers that we are dust, Psalm 103, 13.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.460]   He carries us when we're wearis, Isaiah 46, 4, when we're weak, the beginning of life
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.460]   and the end of life.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.360]   He's a carrier of his children.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   He sings over us and rejoices to do us good, Zephaniah 3, 17.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.660]   He takes us into his own joy rather than into his gloominess, Matthew 25, 21.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.700]   Welcome into the joy of your master.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.980]   So these are all things that a father in his role, according to Ephesians 6, 4, will want
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.020]   to both teach and model for his children.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:09.420]   Fifth, not only will a godly father want to show God the Father to his children in all
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.700]   these ways, but he will want to model for them the heart of Jesus.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.580]   When the disciples saw people bringing children to Jesus, they tried to stop them because
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.420]   they thought, "Oh, these children are not important," and Jesus rebuked them.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:35.820]   And we read this in verse 15 in Luke 18, "Now they were bringing infants to him that he
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.660]   might touch them."
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.540]   Every father should perk up.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.780]   And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.380]   You can think of all kinds of reasons why you might rebuke them.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.580]   Don't you know Jesus is tired?
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.340]   Don't you know that's woman's work?
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.340]   Don't you know whatever?
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.500]   You know, there are a lot of reasons that a man might think of to say, "Children, you're
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.820]   just not important enough for me to get my hands on them."
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.660]   But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Let the children come to me and do not hinder
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.660]   them for to such belong the children of God."
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.100]   These children are like the kind of people that God inclines toward.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.680]   Jesus inclined toward children, not away.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.260]   In fact, he said, I think this is one of the most astonishing things he ever said, I used
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:30.020]   to quote it for our nursery workers at church in Bethlehem, "Whoever receives one such child
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:38.580]   in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives not me, but him who sent me."
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.740]   I mean, that's just staggering.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:47.420]   It says if you receive a child in the name of Jesus, you don't just receive the child,
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.180]   and you don't just receive Jesus, you receive God Almighty, the creator of the universe.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.180]   That's just staggering.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:59.780]   I doubt that any of us can quite fathom what receiving the creator of the universe in receiving
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.800]   a child involves, but that's what it says.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:10.060]   And a husband that wants to be like Jesus and receive Jesus and receive God the Father
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:17.160]   will be very attentive to caring for, receiving, playing with, nurturing his children.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.400]   And finally, a Christian father will want to have the heart of the apostles toward his
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.780]   children and show them how to relate to others from the earliest months of their lives.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.860]   And here's what Paul said his heart was toward the Thessalonians.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.740]   This is 1 Thessalonians 2.6.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:47.780]   "We did not seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:55.540]   made demands as apostles, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:03.940]   her own children, so being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:14.860]   you not only the gospel of God, but also our own selves, because you had become very precious
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.860]   to us."
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:27.380]   Now, if Paul spoke this way as a father in the faith toward his converts, how much more
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:34.180]   would a Christian father want to treat his children this way and want his children to
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:42.140]   learn by the Father's example, even as infants—they pick up so much from the very beginning—even
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.020]   as infants how a godly man loves.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:53.660]   So to this man who says, "Since he works outside the home, he shouldn't have to take
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:04.300]   care of his child," this man's mind and heart need a biblical Holy Spirit makeover,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:11.940]   so that he shifts from the mindset of "have to" to "get to."
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:21.260]   There are few higher callings than to be a god displaying, Christ displaying, apostolic
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:30.700]   love displaying, love, love, love displaying, manhood displaying, father to his own children.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.700]   It's a "get to," not a "have to."
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.700]   Amen.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   Yeah, that's a very good correlation here with the priority of Jesus to little children.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.960]   Thank you for that.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.980]   May we husbands pour our lives out to serve our kids and to serve our wives in joyful
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.980]   sacrifice.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.980]   Thanks for listening.

[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.380]   episodes to dads.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.260]   It's episode number 255, "Dad's Role in Homemaking."
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.580]   Check it out, episode number 255, "Dad's Role in Homemaking," one of my favorite episodes
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.580]   ever.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.260]   And Wednesday we return with a question about Romans 9, 22-23.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.260]   It's a key text.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.020]   It's one we've talked about a lot on this podcast, and there's still yet a lot of questions
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.900]   to be answered from Romans 9, verses 22-23.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.460]   So much of our theology hangs on how we understand these verses.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:31.060]   How and why is God preparing vessels of destruction and vessels of mercy for salvation?
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.540]   It's a weighty text, it's sobering, but it's gloriously God-centered.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.180]   And we're gonna press into that next time.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.180]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.580]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:40.860]   See you then.
