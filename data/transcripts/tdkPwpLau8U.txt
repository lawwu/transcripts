[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.320]   Let's pick up here and we got to polish off the last part
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   of this, the process dynamics in this hour.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.480]   And I'm not going to spend a long time on this
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.640]   but the last thing has to do with P. In our series,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.640]   remember a few weeks ago, the last letter in the acrostic is P
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.560]   to promote or permanentize.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.320]   What are the necessary changes through the counseling elements
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.560]   of instruction, inducement, implementation, integration
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.840]   that we referred to several weeks ago as the eight I's.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.400]   So instruction that is given through the homework
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.720]   that counselees do between the sessions.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.800]   Sometimes you can give good instruction
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.960]   by giving really good homework.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.240]   What are the benefits of that particular homework?
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.560]   Well, what it does is that it promotes the concept
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.720]   that people should be concerned
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.760]   about God's perspectives and solutions.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.920]   It promotes the concept of that people should be concerned
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.960]   about God's perspectives and solutions, not just man.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.800]   So your homework needs to always be biblically oriented.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.600]   That doesn't mean you can't assign books
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.040]   that are extra biblical books.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.480]   Hopefully they're based upon the Bible to read but primarily
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480]   at the core of your homework, you're getting people
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.840]   into the Word of God, finding answers
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.680]   within the Word of God, that's our desire.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   It is also a way of teaching people how to use scriptures,
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.120]   teaching people how to use scriptures,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.800]   how to handle them well.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.840]   You'll find out a lot about your congregation
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.600]   and how they handle scripture by the homework that they do.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.480]   It also sets a pattern for change and for action
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.920]   and change as well because as they complete their homework,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520]   they realize that the change is not just going
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.280]   to occur during one hour a week when you counsel
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.560]   because there are a lot of people who view
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.440]   that hour as magic hour of the week, all right.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.480]   Well, I'm going to come together for the magic hour of the week.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.640]   We've got counseling that hour.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.160]   That's where I really change and grow.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.240]   Well, they may change and grow during your counseling
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.960]   but when you give them homework, you're helping them
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.360]   understand that that change continues past
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.120]   outside of the counseling hour into the actual week itself.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.160]   They can continue that change and growth.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.880]   It also diminishes professional counselees.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.480]   There are some people that would spend the rest
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.060]   of their life just meeting with you, you know that.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.040]   They would, they would eat up all your time.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.320]   No, no, no, you don't want that.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.360]   Again, they may cling to your hope at first
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.440]   but you need to peel their fingers off of you
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   and have them cling to the scriptures.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.340]   And so you want to get them into the scriptures,
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.160]   solving problems in the scripture their way.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.960]   Husbands, wives, parents, kids,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.880]   that's what needs to be happening.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.560]   So it diminishes the professional counselee.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400]   Homework also is a helpful means of gathering data.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.480]   If they do their homework poorly
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.880]   or if they do it only partially,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.320]   that tells you a lot about them, how lazy they are.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.500]   There's so many other things going on in life.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.520]   They're not really working on this particular problem.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.560]   They want to come and talk about their problem
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.960]   and they want you to give them
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.920]   some kind of magical solution.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.120]   And they may think that because you've had seminary training
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.880]   that you're automatically equipped
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.180]   with a bag of spiritual whiffle dust
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.440]   where you can dig into it and sprinkle it on their problem
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.680]   and all their problems will go away.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.320]   No, that's not what happens here.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.660]   They've got to be willing to work on their problems.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.640]   And giving them homework and gathering data
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.520]   on how well they're doing the homework,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.120]   homework helps to,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.720]   it serves as a way to
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.080]   gather data on how well they're growing.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   Good homework then also tends to sustain motivation
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   or momentum in the right direction
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.680]   as they do their homework and keep record of it
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.120]   and move on to bigger issues
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.860]   and resolve it in a God-honoring way.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.120]   It also, good homework encourages concreteness.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   The more specific you can get your counselees to be,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.720]   the more concrete you can get them to be,
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.280]   the quicker you're gonna see change.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.320]   Jeff?
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.800]   >> It's a question back to number five.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.280]   >> Yeah, number five.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.600]   >> Gathering data, like if they don't do their homework,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.560]   what's your philosophy?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.720]   How many times do they have to come to you?
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.060]   >> Oh yeah. >> Not doing their homework.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.800]   >> If they don't do their homework.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.780]   When a person doesn't do their homework,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.780]   the first time that happens, I'll reassign everything again.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.360]   I'll say, hey, we're not gonna go anywhere
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.200]   until you get this done.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.140]   So I'll reassign it.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.700]   They come back and they still don't have it done,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.120]   then I'll reassign it one more time,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.960]   but I'll let 'em know this is the last time
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.120]   because they're basically saying,
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.080]   they can communicate to me verbally
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.560]   that they're really serious about counseling,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.140]   but they're showing to me they're really not.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.520]   Or they disagree with the homework in some way,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   and either they're gonna trust you as a counselor
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.080]   or they're not gonna trust you.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.680]   If you're showing them from God's word
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.360]   what they ought to be doing, then they should trust you.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.120]   If they don't want to trust you,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.640]   well then that's their choice.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.400]   So then you terminate it.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.320]   And sometimes, one of the last appointments,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.480]   after the second or third time
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   they haven't done their homework,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.860]   then I'll say to them, listen,
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.640]   I'm gonna send you home with this homework one more time.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.460]   I don't want to see you.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.960]   I'm not gonna set up a future appointment with you
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.920]   until you've done the homework.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.080]   When you've done the homework, you call back,
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   set up an appointment again, and we'll meet with you.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.720]   But until that homework's done, I don't want to see you.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.280]   That's a good question.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.360]   All right, it also functions as a measuring stick
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:25.200]   on how quickly they're growing, how well they're growing.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.600]   You're able to measure how well they understand
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.000]   what the Bible says about their particular problem,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.960]   how well they handle the Bible
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.480]   in dealing with their problems.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.080]   So it functions as a measuring stick.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.520]   It also decreases the counselee's dependence upon you.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.720]   The more they do their homework,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   the more active they become in the word of God,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.500]   the less dependent they are on you and your counsel.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.240]   Homework also provides a good starting point
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.720]   for every counseling appointment.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   In fact, the first thing that happens
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.480]   every time I do counseling is a couple
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.500]   or a family comes in and sits down.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.680]   I say to them, let's have prayer, and then we'll get started.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.300]   So we have prayer together, and then first thing I say,
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.820]   I open up my little notes that I'm keeping,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.440]   and then it's a copy of the homework that I gave them
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   during the last session, and I start going
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.320]   through the homework and talking about it.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.480]   All right, I assigned you this particular passage
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.640]   of scripture to read and study and identify
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.200]   four or five major things in that passage
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.080]   that kind of hit you right between the eyes,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.040]   and what does God say about your problem
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   as a result of this passage?
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.520]   And I ask you to write those four or five things down.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.120]   So they've done that, I check that off.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.400]   We have a chance to discuss that,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.440]   and then I move to the next thing, and then the next thing.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.080]   So that's a good place to get started.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.700]   That gets everything rolling.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.720]   That gets the conversation going, you know,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.960]   and then I just naturally transition
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.720]   into other instruction that I want to give them
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   during that session.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.920]   It also, you'll find out, when you get your counselees
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.280]   used to doing good homework, and they achieve
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.460]   some success in it, it actually builds their confidence
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.480]   in how to solve problems biblically,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.900]   and that's what you want.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.960]   You want to build their confidence, not self-confidence.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.400]   We're not talking about that.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.520]   We're not Adlerian.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.360]   We're not talking about self-esteem and self-confidence.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.980]   We're not talking about what Jim Dobson
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.360]   would talk about there.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.840]   We're talking about confidence, not in self,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.120]   but in the word of God to solve their problems.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.260]   They see how the Bible speaks to their problem.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.320]   Before, they didn't see it.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.720]   Now, they do, and it builds the counselees' confidence
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.200]   in the scriptures.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.260]   Number 12, there's a failure, then, in the homework
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.320]   provides an opportunity for more data gathering.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.000]   Why have they failed?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.700]   Is there a legitimate reason?
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.280]   Did you give them too much homework?
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   Maybe you did, and sometimes you have to realize
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.460]   you have to back off.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.600]   If you have a counselee that's not a real good reader,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.960]   never really done a whole lot of work before
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.640]   in studying the Bible, you don't want to give them
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   a whole lot, just a little bit.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.540]   You can easily overwhelm them and drown them in homework,
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.480]   and that's not good.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:45.640]   This becomes a opportunity for good data gathering.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.580]   It also forces your counselee to implement
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.620]   and practice the truths that you're talking about
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.460]   in counseling.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.820]   In other words, they have to take this home with them.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.740]   They have to work on it.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.340]   That's why it's called homework.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.100]   So, they have to take it home and practice it now.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.640]   So, it forces them to do that.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.340]   14, problem-solving book now for the future.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.300]   In other words, I always have the counselee
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.060]   keep a record of all their homework in a notebook
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.540]   so that if this problem that we're working on
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.000]   comes back later on in the future,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.180]   they have a resource manual to go back to
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.500]   and say, all right, this is what we worked on.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.540]   This is what we studied.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.020]   This is what we learned.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.140]   So, they don't always have to come back to you
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.840]   and start up the counseling again.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.100]   So, it becomes a good resource manual for them.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.740]   A personalized, by the way, that's what makes it so neat.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.540]   It's a personalized resource manual
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.080]   for their particular problem.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.340]   Boy, I've had some counselees have a notebook
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.580]   that thick when they were done.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.020]   I mean, they just page after page after page
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.920]   of Bible study, work, observations,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.420]   dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.420]   And when you have a personalized manual or workbook
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.540]   on a problem that they've struggled with all of their life,
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.300]   now they've got something concrete
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.000]   to take with them into the future.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.420]   So, it's a problem-solving book for the future.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.900]   15, and last of all, it provides people with tools
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.640]   for use with other people.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.220]   Most people who keep this kind of a workbook
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.860]   will end up using it with other people.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.580]   In fact, the real danger is they'll interpret
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.000]   everybody's problems through their problems.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.340]   That's dangerous.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.940]   That's not a good thing, but there probably is
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.980]   an awful lot of things that they learned
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.180]   as a result of their problem that are applicable
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.220]   to a variety of different issues that are out there
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.820]   from a scriptural standpoint.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.220]   So, there's all the benefits of providing
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.900]   really, really good homework
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.480]   that is beneficial to the counselee.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.300]   Now, what is the nature of good homework?
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.680]   Well, you gotta have, it's gotta be biblical
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.240]   in orientation as well as function.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.620]   What do we mean by that?
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:32.040]   It needs to, well, it actually,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.080]   at the core of all good homework is, like I said,
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.960]   getting people into the Word of God,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.360]   solving their problems from scripture,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.860]   where they see it, they study it,
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.120]   they understand it correctly.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.420]   They see it within context.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.960]   They're not trying to pull it out of context.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.720]   They see the theological implications to it,
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   and they're changing their life in accordance with that.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.520]   That's what we mean by that.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.800]   Good homework also is specific concrete.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.200]   It's not vague and fuzzy.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.760]   Get them out of fuzzy land.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.200]   Get them out of Vaguesville.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.180]   The more you allow your counselee to be fuzzy or vague,
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.240]   the slower their development will be.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.160]   The more concrete and specific about it,
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.020]   let me give you an instance.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.620]   Like, for instance, you'll ask a husband and wife
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.020]   is having problems, and they come back in,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.880]   and you start to review their homework,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.260]   and you say, listen, George,
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.420]   what is it that you've learned this week
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.440]   in order to be a more godly husband?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.100]   George says, well, pastor,
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.020]   I've learned to love my wife more.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:58.740]   Well, that's really good, George, but what does that mean?
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.520]   Does that mean, when most American Europeans
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.860]   talk about loving their wife more,
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   it usually means emoting lots of good emotions towards her.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.060]   So is that what you're gonna do?
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.180]   You're gonna go home every day and sit there and,
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.620]   mmm, and emote lots of good emotions towards your wife?
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.420]   Is that what you're gonna do, George?
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.780]   No, I got a feeling that's not what you're looking for.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.260]   You're right, George, that's not what I'm looking for.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.460]   Okay, what does that mean,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.100]   you're gonna love your wife more?
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.140]   I'm gonna think of her first.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.300]   Well, how are you gonna think of her first?
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.460]   Well, maybe I'll help her out
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.740]   with some of the responsibilities around the house.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.880]   Well, that's good, George, like what?
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.820]   Let's be specific here.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.980]   What are we talking about, helping your wife out
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.540]   with some of the responsibilities around the house?
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:01.520]   I guess I could take out the garbage.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.500]   Does your wife take out the garbage, George?
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.100]   Well, I guess she does.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.600]   Well, why is that happening?
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.420]   You ought to be doing it, right?
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.060]   Oh, I guess so.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.980]   Anything else, George?
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.780]   Is taking out the garbage gonna communicate
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.980]   that you love your wife?
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:24.080]   She's sitting there, smiling, like this.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.540]   George hasn't taken out the garbage ever in their marriage.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.380]   Well, I guess I could help her out after meals
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.200]   and maybe even wash the dishes.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.460]   Now his wife's having a heart attack.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.620]   [panting]
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.260]   She's hyperventilating, okay?
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.660]   That's good, George, that's right.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.380]   That's a good way to show your wife
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.020]   that you really love her.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.180]   What else, George?
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.140]   Well, I'm not gonna throw my clothes and underwear
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.500]   all over the bedroom.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.540]   Well, that's good, where are you gonna put 'em, George?
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.380]   In the laundry.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.720]   Well, what's gonna happen to that laundry?
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.020]   Well, my wife's gonna wash 'em.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.580]   Why's your wife gotta wash 'em?
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.300]   You want me to wash 'em, Pastor?
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.260]   Yeah, what about you washing and doing the laundry?
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.180]   George's eyes are like this.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.060]   His wife is.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.780]   All right.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.940]   Now we're getting down to concrete.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.220]   Illustrations, George, this is exactly
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.820]   what we're talking about.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.020]   Don't let them be in Fuzzyland or Vaguesville.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.520]   'Cause they'll try to get away with that.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.940]   They'll say, well, you know, I need to love my wife more.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.920]   And they'll expect you to accept that as the answer.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.220]   No, no, no, no, you pin George down.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.460]   You get him to be very specific
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.740]   about what he's talking about.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.380]   All right, then the next week, guess what?
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.980]   You're gonna ask George the next week,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.820]   I'm making a little note in my notes,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.420]   I'm gonna ask George how many times
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   did George do the dishes for his wife?
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.700]   How many times did he take out the trash?
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.520]   How many times did he sweep up the room or run the vacuum?
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.540]   How many times did he, you know, I wanna know these things.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.460]   I wanna know what's really changing
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.940]   on a week-to-week basis in George's life.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.780]   I wanna know that.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:18.300]   And the same thing with George's wife, Irene.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.980]   She can't just get away with,
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.060]   well, I've gotta submit myself more to my husband, okay?
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.940]   Well, what does that mean?
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.700]   That's very fuzzy.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.140]   I mean, that's the right thing, you got the right concept,
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.780]   but how is that going to be specifically applied
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.500]   to your particular situation in your home?
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.300]   How are you going to submit yourself to your husband?
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:48.860]   Well, I guess I'm gonna let him have the checkbook.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.320]   Well, that's a good idea.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.220]   All right, let him have the checkbook.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.140]   That's right.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.020]   I guess I'm going to think about him before myself.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.960]   Well, good, that's good, Irene.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.060]   How are you gonna do that?
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.140]   How are you gonna think about George before yourself?
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:20.940]   Well, rather than preparing dinner when he gets home
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:28.420]   with something that I would want to have for dinner,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.700]   I'm gonna prepare something
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.760]   that George will really like for dinner.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.740]   That's good, Irene.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.080]   Something that George would really like for dinner.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.000]   That's good, like what?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.820]   What would George really like?
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.220]   What is it, apple pie?
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.940]   Oh, apple pie, Ruben says.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.620]   [laughing]
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.080]   I gotta tell your wife.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.340]   [laughing]
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.140]   Not yet.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.380]   [laughing]
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   That's right, yes, can you pan the camera down
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.420]   a little bit here to?
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.660]   [laughing]
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.340]   So there's, you gotta get them to be specific, concrete,
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.180]   practical in addressing their marital needs.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:19.180]   Again, it's not enough for them to commit themselves
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.980]   to communicating better.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.060]   That's not enough.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.220]   They have gotta say, okay, this coming week,
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.460]   we're gonna sit down together three times
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.420]   and we're gonna spend 45 minutes or an hour, three times,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.100]   where we have a chance to communicate
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.740]   and talk about some of our concerns
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.580]   and some of the problems that we have that are going on.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.820]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.020]   There also needs to be, you need to be flexible
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.620]   in varying dynamics of marriage as well.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   Flexibility means that you're not so hard and fast
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.260]   on one particular course of action
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.620]   that you're not willing to give your spouse an opportunity
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.180]   to help to vary that course of action or change.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.820]   There's gotta be that flexibility.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.320]   There has to be appropriate or applicable,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.160]   the homework has to be appropriate or applicable,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.360]   not theologically abstract.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.880]   We want them to take theology and make it concrete again.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   We don't want them to just remain in abstract terms.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.020]   It's easy for people to do that.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.600]   It also needs to be reportable
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.240]   so you can measure success and progress.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   So how are they gonna report this?
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.540]   So it needs to be reportable in that sense.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:50.540]   So that's the nature of good homework.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.500]   What are some of the kinds of homework
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.220]   for promoting good change?
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.020]   There's a lot of published material that are out there.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.100]   There's also, any more there was.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.780]   I mean, when I first started in biblical counseling,
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.300]   there wasn't very much published,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.440]   but there is an awful lot.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.740]   Just beginning with the textbooks
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.380]   that are required for this class is a good example of that.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.940]   Relevant homework for marriage and family issues
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.220]   is also found in the appendices
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.260]   of various sections of the course outline,
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.580]   as well as in, in some cases,
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.620]   in some of the books that you're reading.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.580]   There's also freelance homework
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.140]   that you think is appropriate and relevant.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.860]   And oftentimes, it's the freelance homework
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.900]   that is some of the best
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.980]   if you know how to put it together the right way.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.940]   Like, for instance, you ask them to study
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.500]   1 Peter chapter three and verse two
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.780]   and write out 10 ways you can demonstrate
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.780]   chaste and respectful behavior as a wife.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.980]   And we talked about that before.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.540]   That's a wife that's especially married
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.980]   to an unbelieving husband there in the context.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.620]   And you make a list of 20 things
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.620]   that you can do practically
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.940]   to show your wife that you love her.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.740]   All right, George, let's make that list out.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.740]   Give me 20 ways where you're going to show practically
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.420]   that you love your wife.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.180]   What are they?
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.380]   So you have to develop that.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.820]   And that's part of the homework.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:25.140]   Then, also, study 1 Corinthians 13
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.940]   and make a chart with two columns
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.740]   with each term's definition in one column
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.180]   and with two or three ideas
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.060]   of how you intend to practically demonstrate it
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.220]   to your spouse in the next column.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.980]   So you're writing out each term
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.100]   that's listed there in 1 Corinthians 13
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.660]   and then you're gonna highlight two or three things
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.140]   that you think are gonna be helpful
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.620]   to demonstrate this practically to your spouse.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.500]   Or D, have devotions and pray.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.940]   Now, keep a record of what you do.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.540]   Develop a prayer list for your marriage and your spouse
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.600]   and also for the family members
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.700]   so that you are praying for one another.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.140]   So, Irene, I want you to make a prayer list about George.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.660]   I want you to list 20, 25 things on that prayer list
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.140]   that you can pray for about George.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.180]   And, George, I want you to do the same thing with Irene.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.340]   I want you to develop 20, 25 things
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.200]   that you can pray about for her.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.300]   Keep, also, a companionship record.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.740]   Write down every time you spend time together
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.580]   and what you've really discussed
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.440]   when you spent that time together.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.540]   That's a companionship record.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   And then, complete a read the Bible assignment on marriage
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.620]   and record your thoughts from the assigned passage.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.700]   And you can develop it.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.860]   You could put together several critical passages
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.460]   that deal with marital relationships
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.020]   and you read 'em together, you discuss them,
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.660]   you highlight key ideas.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.260]   Sometimes I'll say I want the husband
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.280]   to lead the conversation and call the meeting
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.420]   where you're going to do this
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.300]   and I want the wife to be the secretary
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.080]   and write down the key thoughts of discussion
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.000]   that you spend time doing or discussing.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.420]   Make a list of the good times and bad times journal
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.260]   for the week.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.920]   Identify what were the good times this week
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.980]   that you had together.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.660]   But, also, identify what were the bad times
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.060]   and what was the difference between the two.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.760]   Or, a review of rate your marriage inventories
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.300]   and discuss the things that you do
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.820]   to make improvements in your home.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.380]   Now, where you find that is in Wayne Mack's material,
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.060]   A Homework for Biblical Counselors, Volumes One and Two.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.300]   And in that is a rate your marriage inventory.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.860]   It's a little key thing that you can reproduce
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.940]   and they tell you you can reproduce it.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.020]   They give you permission to do that.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:00.020]   And it's a little helpful tool to get into how a wife
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.660]   or how a husband views their marriage,
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.380]   what's going on there.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.380]   So, a rate your marriage inventory.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:13.380]   Secondly, there's also instruction in the form of teaching.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.020]   Explaining what is the major issues
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.820]   in their individual lives they need to change
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.700]   in order to improve their marriage and their home.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.700]   What are the major issues in order to improve
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.700]   their marriage and their home.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:41.220]   For example, in 2 Timothy 3 and verse 16,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.700]   and in Colossians 1:28 and Colossians 3:16,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.720]   it uses the Greek term didosco.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.880]   Didosco, it has to do with teaching.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.820]   Marriage and family counseling done God's way
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.080]   involves large dosages of teaching
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.040]   and instruction from the scripture.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.140]   Now, usually, as seminary students,
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.420]   you're not afraid to do that.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.820]   You're well prepared to do some serious preaching here
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.920]   and teaching here, so that's not usually a problem.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.160]   It's not enough for them to know the right things.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.940]   They've gotta, they must be admonished and trained
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.340]   to think, do, and desire the right things.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.580]   Think, do, and desire the right things.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.380]   I'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.340]   And also, Titus chapter two and verse 15,
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.040]   Paul says, "Speak."
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.740]   This is different than just say the right things.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.180]   That's the word let go.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:45.320]   You must speak up with clear instruction and direction.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.740]   And I think it's vitally important that when you,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.980]   when you teach,
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:27:00.460]   that you're teaching in order to help them to identify
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.520]   what is ruling or mastering their heart.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.420]   What is it that is the functional idols
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.340]   that tend to reign there?
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.080]   That heart says, I must.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.420]   This is what sometimes the scripture will call
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.620]   their lust or their craving
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:35.440]   or what their heart demands.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:41.420]   That's what they must do.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:49.100]   Now, because it is this aspect of the heart
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:56.060]   that really fuels their attitudes towards one another,
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:04.480]   their actions towards one another,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:10.360]   their reactions towards one another,
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.220]   their beliefs about one another.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.740]   If they're suspicious,
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.180]   if they think their mate is lying to them.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:29.980]   And what you've got here, all of this really
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.600]   is what the Bible calls the fruit.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.360]   And down here on a heart level is the root.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   And so your instruction is geared towards helping them see,
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.140]   this is what you see coming at you.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.740]   This is what you've collected in terms of your data,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.180]   what's happening in the marriage.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.240]   Their attitudes, their actions, their reactions,
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.980]   their beliefs, even their words
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.060]   and the words that they choose.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.780]   And all of this is fueled here,
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:08.980]   motivated by whatever is reigning in their heart.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:14.100]   And when you interpret that data,
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.340]   what you're attempting to do really is
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.940]   you're trying to get at
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.540]   what's really going on in their heart.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.580]   This is what you see in counseling.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.860]   This is what you hear.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.380]   This is what your homework reveals.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.220]   So when you interpret it, the interpretation process
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.540]   of what's really happening on a heart level,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.620]   what are they saying?
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.740]   I must be in control of my marriage.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.880]   I must have a wife that respects me.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.260]   I must have a husband that loves me.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.060]   I must have children that are obedient.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.320]   And this is what ends up reigning in their heart.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.500]   That becomes their functional God.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.760]   This bespeaks to what they ultimately worship.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.600]   That drives this behavior.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.160]   That's why then when they don't receive,
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.000]   when they don't have children that are obedient,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   then they become sullen, depressed, or angry,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.460]   hateful, and mean, and reactive.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.600]   So it's that root, I must have obedient children,
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.940]   that fuels their actions.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.720]   So your instruction is geared in that direction.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.120]   And so you're speaking to them.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.460]   You have to speak the right things.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.200]   You've got to speak with clear instruction and direction,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.900]   and especially getting at heart issues.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.580]   Instruction then in the form of reproof and admonition.
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:03.680]   Here, Titus 2.15, Paul not only tells Titus
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.260]   to do, speak, also to exhort and reprove.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.960]   Para kaleo is the term to exhort.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.420]   It's the same word that's used in Romans 12.1,
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.920]   which is a corporate command to be one.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.860]   I exhort you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.720]   that you present your bodies a living sacrifice.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.000]   Bodies are plural.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.840]   A, living sacrifice, is singular.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.800]   So it's corporately applied together
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.240]   as a single sacrifice.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.360]   A pastoral command on how to admonish
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.120]   older and younger men and women,
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.760]   in 1 Peter 5, verses one and two.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.880]   Philippians 4.2, Ephesians 4.1.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   Paul is a good example of personal admonishment here.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.220]   Sometimes you're gonna have to say to George and Irene,
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:04.220]   listen, George, I think that you have an idol in your heart
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.480]   that you need to see and repent of.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.360]   That idol says, I must have a wife
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   that caters to all my needs.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:25.560]   Or Irene, I must have a husband who
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.920]   loves me the way I think I should be loved
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.400]   and the way that I deserve.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.880]   That can become an idolatrous desire in her heart
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.960]   that fuels her actions, just as with George.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.640]   Then it talks about reproving.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.880]   Eligeo, which is to cross-examine
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.380]   for the purpose of convicting
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.240]   or refuting an opponent to convict.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.080]   John 16.8, Jesus uses this word
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.060]   to describe the work of the Holy Spirit in the world.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.600]   And he, when he comes, will convict.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.660]   There's our word.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.440]   Convict the world concerning sin,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.960]   righteousness, and judgment.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.200]   2 Timothy 3:16-17, all scripture is inspired by God
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.960]   and is profitable for teaching, for reproof,
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.820]   for correction, for training in righteousness
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.520]   so that the man of God may be adequate,
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.800]   equipped for every good work.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.720]   So our word reproof is our same word as the word convict.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.020]   And hence you get the idea of convicting,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.880]   reproving, refuting.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:41.160]   So your instruction is going to take that on in scripture.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:50.920]   Then Colossians 1, verse 26, and also 3.16.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.720]   Note Paul not only refers to teaching,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.280]   but also admonishing, warning, or counseling.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.580]   Here the Greek word is nutheteo.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   And the key idea here is nus, which means mind.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:14.800]   In English, we would translate it the mind.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.120]   And then tithemi,
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:26.440]   which means to place or to put.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   So you get this idea that the concept together
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:40.060]   is to place or put sense into the mind.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:53.820]   That's why this word nutheteo is a really good word
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.540]   for counseling because that's what you're doing
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.120]   when you counsel someone.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.480]   You're placing or putting sense into the mind.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.160]   You can see example of this here in Acts 20,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:11.620]   verse 31, in Romans 15, 14, in 1 Corinthians 4.14,
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.380]   in Colossians 1.28, in Colossians 3.16,
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.140]   1 Thessalonians 5.12, 1 Thessalonians 5.14,
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.600]   2 Thessalonians 3.15.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.720]   You see in the English translations,
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.620]   the King James version there at the top
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.060]   on the left-hand side.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.660]   In the middle there is the New American Standard version,
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.580]   the NASV, and then on the right side there
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.180]   is the New International version, or the NIV.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.280]   And how they choose to translate it.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.220]   Usually warn or admonish or instruct
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:46.140]   is the normal way that it can be translated.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.580]   It also can be translated counsel.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   So to place sense into the mind is the idea.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:04.240]   So there are two things these passages make clear
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.720]   about the activity of exhorting, rebuking, or admonishing.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.120]   Number one, the purpose of exhortation or admonition
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.000]   is to place sense back into the husband and wife
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.380]   so that their goal and agenda is to be a marriage
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.920]   and a home that honors the Lord in everything.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.720]   And this is only to come from biblical instruction.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.760]   There's no amount of psychological instruction
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.260]   that's going to build a biblical home.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.600]   It's only gonna come from biblical instruction.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.160]   Number two, the manner of exhortation or admonition,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   Romans 12.1, 1 Timothy 5.1, 2 Timothy 2.24 and 25,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.120]   and 2 Timothy 4.2, Galatians 6.1.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.320]   And each of those passages' strong verbs
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.360]   now are used to express exhorting, rebuking,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.700]   admonishment so that their home and marriage
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.740]   is brought to rest upon the word of God.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.040]   That's what we're after.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.240]   They want their marriage to be,
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.780]   to rest upon the word of God and the word of God alone.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.980]   Then there is instruction in the form
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.880]   of specific suggestions or ideas
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.800]   about how to put biblical directives
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.060]   about family living into practice.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.840]   Working with counselees to make plans for realizing
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.640]   and implementing and integrating God's principles
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.480]   into their marriage and family life.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.240]   There's also instruction number five
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.840]   in the form of coaching.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.520]   There is a real sense in which every counselor
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.120]   is like a coach, not just to tell them what to do,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.880]   but to prod them to practice what they do,
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.180]   what they should be doing.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.620]   You're coaching them on how to do it better.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.220]   Almost the same way that a piano teacher
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.060]   would sit and observe how the student
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.060]   is putting their fingers on the piano keys
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.000]   and forming groupings of notes.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.280]   And so they give them suggestions
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.920]   about those kind of things.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.040]   Typically a biblical coach helps counselees
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.120]   to find their own solutions by asking questions
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.240]   that give them insight into their situations
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.520]   with scripture as a guide.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.640]   A godly coach holds a counselee accountable
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.180]   so that if a counselee agrees to plan,
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.760]   to a plan to achieve a goal,
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.740]   a coach will help motivate them to complete their plan
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   with a proper biblical motives for home and for marriage.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.100]   So a coach comes alongside to make these practical
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.500]   suggestions on how to implement this in a better way.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:58.060]   That's the way you can promote and permanentize.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:05.160]   We're working on that acrostic, C-A-P-T,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.440]   that we talked about before.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.300]   Promote and permanentize.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:17.900]   Well the last one in that little acrostic
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:23.920]   is the termination of counseling.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.220]   The termination of counseling.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.160]   How do you know when to terminate?
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.500]   You have to keep the purpose of counseling in mind
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.820]   and that is in our eight eyes ultimately integrating
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.520]   this change that has been brought about by the word of God
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.700]   in their life and their marriage and their home
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.320]   into their everyday life.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.460]   That's what we're looking for.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.600]   We want them to integrate this truth
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   or change into their life.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.120]   So how can a biblical counselor know
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.860]   that integration has ultimately occurred is the question.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.120]   Well the counselee understands the problem
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.320]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.920]   That's pretty obvious to the counselor.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.560]   If George and Irene understand the problem really well
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.880]   then that helps you understand they're ready to terminate.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.640]   They know what God wants them to do.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.960]   I mean that's clear to them too.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.400]   They know exactly what God wants them to do now.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.020]   Or C here, they regularly handle problems in a biblical way.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.360]   In fact you may in counseling hypothetically
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.900]   throw out problems to them and saying okay,
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.880]   now how would you have handled this in the past
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   when you didn't know how to do it biblically?
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.720]   And they'd share it with you.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.280]   How has things changed now?
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.260]   How do you handle it differently now?
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.320]   And they're able to share the biblical way.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.920]   Furthermore they accurately diagnose
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.360]   their own problems and mistakes too.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.480]   When you get counselees coming in saying,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.680]   you know I caught myself doing that again
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.480]   and I know what the problem is.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.120]   When you get them saying that kind of thing
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.060]   you know they're ready to graduate from counseling
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.920]   or they're getting pretty close to it.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.800]   Or they accept personal responsibility for their failures
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.880]   where earlier in counseling it was really easy
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.240]   for George to blame Irene and Irene to blame George
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.440]   and both of them to blame the kids.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.740]   You know they're always blaming somebody else.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.920]   Now they're not doing that.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.660]   They're accepting responsibilities for failures.
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.840]   And they accept that.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.620]   And they're searching for and find biblical solutions.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.160]   In fact they're really excited about this.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.720]   They're going to the Bible more and more
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.800]   in order to find solutions to their daily problems.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.200]   Or they've faced their trials
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.880]   and they've handled them very well.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.280]   Or maybe they failed but they've identified biblically why
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.780]   and they've recovered from it.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:54.400]   Or they share what they've learned with other people
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.040]   and they're really excited about sharing
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.920]   what they've learned with other people.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.740]   Or others notice and comment about the change.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.200]   People at church, other members of the family say,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.640]   "Wow, mom and dad have really changed," the kids say.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   They're not the way that they were before.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:18.360]   Or others begin to seek the counselee's help
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.360]   and they want to know what their secret is.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:26.680]   Or the counselee's can list and document their changes.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.180]   Or the counselee themselves thinks he's ready.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.380]   They think he's ready.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:40.540]   That needs to be there.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.900]   If they don't think that they're ready
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.940]   then there's a reason why and you need to find out why.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.740]   Or inventories show significant improvement
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:54.500]   in their lives.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:00.220]   Then you know they're ready to graduate from counseling.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.680]   You're ready to terminate them.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.960]   That doesn't mean knock 'em off.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.460]   That means you're ready to graduate them out of counseling.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.560]   Now how do you do that?
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.140]   So especially so that reversals are really minimized.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.440]   Well, you do it gradually.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.960]   Move from every week to every month,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.280]   to every four months, to every six months
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.920]   and then use these times for regular checkups.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   So one of the ways you can minimize any kind of reversal
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.640]   is to gradually terminate them.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.040]   You do it with instructions.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.680]   You always be sure that their counseling notes are available
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   and they can recite the biblical process of confession,
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.880]   repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.080]   to deal with problems when they occur in the future
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.120]   and they will have problems.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.960]   Or with plans for a checkup and homework
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   that must be completed for the next checkup.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.900]   This will help them to continue the process
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.320]   of biblical growth and change in their marriage.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.240]   So you tell 'em, okay, listen,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.160]   I wanna meet with you in the next six months
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.800]   and during that particular session,
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.160]   we're gonna do a checkup on all the things
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.440]   that we've been talking about.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.240]   I'm gonna create a little checkup list
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.360]   and we're gonna go through that to see how you're doing.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.920]   You're communicating better?
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.680]   George, are you helping out Irene?
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.640]   Irene, are you thinking about George before yourself?
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   How's that going?
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.620]   And I don't want you to give me the fuzzies.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.340]   I want you to give me the concrete things.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.120]   What has really changed here?
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:41.100]   I'm counseling a guy this past week.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.740]   He's had struggles and problems in his marriage
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.420]   and one of the ways that I have gotten a clue
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.660]   that he's ready to graduate
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.820]   is he's initiated some certain things with his wife
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.340]   without me even encouraging him to do so.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.180]   And one of the things he did in the last session
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.760]   he told me about really surprised me.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.840]   He's initiated one night a week where he has a date night.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.800]   His wife comes home.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.840]   She's taking classes at a local university
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.160]   and his wife comes home at night
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.800]   and that particular night,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.760]   he has a really wonderful meal prepared for her
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.680]   and a candlelight dinner and it's getting so that,
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.880]   I mean, here's a marriage that really was really rocky
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.600]   that she really looks forward to this.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.700]   She really enjoys that and they sit around for hours
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.540]   after that dinner just talking.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.700]   They've never ever had that in years and years of marriage.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.080]   They've never had that.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:41.280]   Well, let's review if we can real quickly with that CAPT.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.480]   What are we talking about?
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.880]   The first thing we talked about was context,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.080]   getting a hold of the context
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.800]   of what's going on in the problem,
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.360]   grabbing all the significant details.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.400]   Then you have to assess and analyze, all right,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.960]   what are the real hard issues
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.600]   that are fueling all the behaviors and actions?
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.880]   You have to assess that.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.080]   And then you promote and permanentize.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.320]   We just talked about that.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.000]   And then last of all, you're ready to terminate
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.680]   when you're sure that they're handling things
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.760]   in a biblical way.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.200]   That's what we wanna talk about.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.400]   We wanna enter into section number two here in our class
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.480]   on really actually getting into the scripture
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.280]   and what the scripture says about marriage
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.200]   and family counseling.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.240]   We've kind of laid some of the background with part one.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.000]   And now in part two, we wanna take a look
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.120]   at some foundational issues that will hopefully help you.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.160]   And one of the first things here
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.380]   in terms of foundational issue
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.800]   has to do with God's design for marriage,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.320]   God's design for marriage.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   And we could easily go into all the aberrations of marriage.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.920]   We could easily go into that.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.560]   And we would spend lots and lots of times
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.120]   with all the aberrations.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.280]   But rather than that, we've chosen specifically
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.720]   to teach you the real thing.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.640]   What does God intend?
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.280]   And once you understand the real thing,
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.360]   then you can pick up on the aberrations here.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.800]   So let's talk about this a little bit.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.640]   And let me introduce it with some perspectives
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.860]   that people have about marriage.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.220]   One is, has to do with the origin of problems.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:31.960]   How do problems get rolling in a marriage?
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.360]   Well, part of the answer is,
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.160]   some of those problems get rolling
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.360]   from the very beginning of the relationship.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   Many people marry for the wrong reason.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.060]   Already, that sets marriage in the wrong direction.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.220]   For example, some people marry
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.280]   because they've been promiscuous.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.780]   And they sort of have a Roman Catholic view of marriage.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.180]   Once a guy and a girl have had sex together,
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.140]   then they ought to get married.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.460]   Actually, from a biblical perspective,
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.860]   they're demonstrating that they're not ready for marriage
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.060]   once they've had sex.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.240]   Because they're showing
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.340]   that they cannot control themselves, self-control.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.700]   Just because they have a little piece of paper
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.540]   that says they're married,
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.620]   doesn't mean that automatically
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.140]   they're gonna have self-control.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.420]   If someone else comes along that seems to be tempting,
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.420]   then they'll probably do the same thing.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:39.500]   But some people get married out of guilt.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.320]   Well, we've been promiscuous, so let's get married.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.440]   That's a poor reason to be married.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.200]   Furthermore, some people compensate for faults.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.960]   That's why they get married.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.720]   They're running from perceived faults.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:01.100]   They see the other person as sometimes having more money.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.720]   Or they see the other person as being more outgoing.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.080]   Or the other person as being more stable.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.060]   Or coming from a better home
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.440]   in terms of there isn't as much turmoil in the home.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.980]   And so they run from the faults
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:21.900]   that they perceive in their lives
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.060]   and get married to this other person
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.240]   who appears to have life together.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.960]   Or at least has an appeal of life that they want.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.160]   So they're running from those faults.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:41.160]   Then there are other people who marry to realize an image.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   They just have always seen themselves as being married.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:54.020]   And sometimes the gals here outdo the guys in this area
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.940]   because they always dream about having a little house
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.140]   with a white picket fence
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:04.140]   and kids joyfully playing in the yard and all of this.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.460]   And they wanna get married in order to realize that image.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.820]   And they'll take care of the disagreeable aspects
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.980]   of their husband later.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.620]   But in order to have this image, we're gonna get married.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.860]   So I can have a home and have kids.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.660]   Most women by the age of five
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.660]   have their entire weddings planned out.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.920]   You know that, don't you?
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.220]   They won't tell you that.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:38.220]   But they know what kind of dress they're gonna wear
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:43.580]   and they know what color the dress
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.040]   of the bridesmaids are gonna be.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.000]   And I'll never forget the day that I proposed to my wife,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.460]   I said, "Have you thought about our wedding?"
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:57.380]   And she goes, "Well, no, not really."
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.500]   And 10 minutes later, she was talking to her sister
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.340]   and she was talking about who was gonna be standing
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.940]   in the wedding and what the color of the dresses
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.020]   were gonna be and exactly what kind of dress
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.840]   she was going to have.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.180]   I'm going, "What?
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.980]   "You haven't given any thought to this.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.860]   "You've given loads of thought to this,
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.020]   "down to the minute details."
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:18.100]   So there are some people who marry
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.820]   in order to realize an image.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.500]   And then there are other people who marry
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.940]   as a way to legitimize sex.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.260]   They grew up in a Christian home
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.140]   and they themselves are Christian
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.860]   and they know it's not right to have sex prior to marriage.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.100]   And so this is a way to, this is where the,
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:39.100]   often the guys go way out beyond the gals here at this point.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.940]   Now we can have sex together
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.380]   and we don't have to feel guilty about it any longer.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.300]   Even though, is it possible for a marital couple
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.140]   to be having sex together only with each other
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.660]   and still be in sin?
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.420]   The answer is yes.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.260]   Why?
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.540]   Because it's greed-oriented sex
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.060]   and it violates 1 Corinthians 7.3.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.940]   So is it possible for you not be having sex
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.900]   with anybody else except for your husband and your wife
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.700]   and still be doing it the wrong way?
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.060]   Yeah, we'll talk about that a little bit later.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.500]   So why are there problems in marriage?
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.980]   Well, part of the answer to that is
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.060]   because people marry for the wrong reasons.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:27.100]   In addition to that, when you add that in a culture,
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.380]   all over the world, in cultures all over the world,
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.860]   the family is under attack.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:35.100]   In our American culture alone,
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.900]   I mean, you have the playboy philosophy,
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.340]   which is really an attack upon God's concept
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.000]   of what the family ought to be.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.100]   You got gay and lesbian agendas,
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.860]   which is a direct frontal attack
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.580]   upon what God says marriage should be.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.340]   You have entertainment mediums, television sitcoms,
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.340]   internet, movies, radio, making fun of marriage.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:08.460]   And even if you have an intact relationship
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.220]   there in the TV sitcom,
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.960]   usually there's something radically wrong about it.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.860]   I remember watching several years ago the Bill Cosby show,
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:24.260]   and Bill Cosby is married.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:28.420]   It was kind of unusual to have a married husband and wife,
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.620]   but even in that show, dad was the imbecile,
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.380]   and the wife and the kids always knew better.
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.940]   He was the idiot of the family.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:41.600]   So there's this distorted view of what should be happening,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.500]   even in the entertainment mediums,
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.600]   even when they try to depict an intact marriage,
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.640]   which is rare.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.040]   And then there's materialism.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:58.580]   Materialism just elevates things above people.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:03.300]   And there are a lot of marriages that are married
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.500]   really for the convenience of materialism.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.820]   She works, he works, and they both contribute
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:12.460]   into a large pool of funds in order to get their toys,
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.060]   whatever toys they want.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:18.580]   And then we live in a culture
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.100]   where man is constantly inventing
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.940]   some kind of substitutes for marriage.
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.560]   I talked about this at the very beginning of the course,
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.980]   where there's trial marriages, contract marriages,
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.160]   live-in lovers, semi-married, prenuptial agreements,
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:35.000]   or lat marriages, L-A-T marriages is living apart together.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.860]   There are a lot of marriages in San Francisco
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:42.020]   that are that way, where a husband and wife are married,
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.740]   and she lives in her own home on one side of town,
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.780]   and he lives in his house on the other side of town,
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.060]   and they occasionally get together
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.340]   and sleep in the same bed together,
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.140]   but they basically live separately.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.020]   That's called lat marriages, living apart together.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:01.620]   So it's, in a sense, they would say,
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.600]   all the blessings of the single life,
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.580]   where you don't have to put up
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.340]   with all the idiosyncrasies of a spouse
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.460]   or living with a spouse, but then you also get
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.940]   all the quote-unquote blessings of marriage,
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.840]   where occasionally you can sleep in the same bed together.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:19.100]   That's not a marriage.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.820]   That's legal prostitution,
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:30.220]   where people sleep together occasionally,
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.780]   but they're not really married, not in God's eyes.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:37.500]   What's the two-fold effect of all this?
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.140]   When you add this up, a couple things will happen,
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.380]   and you can see this in churches all over the place.
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.540]   A lot of young people who are getting married
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.220]   are really unsure about marriage.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:53.780]   A lot of doubts, you can see it in their eyes.
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.420]   You do premarital counseling, you can see the doubts.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:02.100]   And secondly, there are a lot of people
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.920]   who are already married who have lost hope.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.020]   Well, this is the way it's always gonna be.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:15.420]   I'm supervising a woman for her national certification
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.780]   in counseling right now who's counseling another woman
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.220]   who is married, and this other woman
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.840]   has pretty much lost all hope for her marriage.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.500]   They just began counseling, so we're hoping
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.940]   that this gal begins to catch on
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:32.300]   on how the word of God can transform her life
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.580]   and re-instill hope there.
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.440]   But she's at the end of her ropes.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.860]   Well, this is one of the things that gets me all excited
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.460]   about biblical and pastoral counseling,
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.380]   is the fact that I believe that Jesus Christ
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.220]   and His church has the answers, lasting answers.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.440]   And we've gotta get busy proclaiming them.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.400]   We have lasting answers to these problems.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.660]   When you've got young people that are very unsure
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.660]   about marriage, they doubt whether or not
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:11.480]   their marriage is going to be successful.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.900]   They know and they've heard these statistics
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.340]   that one out of two marriages,
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.180]   even though some of those statistics
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.980]   are not really fully valid,
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.740]   they're based upon wrong assumptions,
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.780]   but one out of very two marriages,
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.480]   everybody's heard about it, ends in divorce.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.240]   And they wonder whether or not
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.300]   they're gonna be one of those statistics.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.980]   Well, let's take a look at this in our outline.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.300]   Roman numeral number one here
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.240]   about contemporary presuppositions in God's design.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.900]   Now, there are secular theories out there
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.060]   that predominate, and I try to stay up with these things.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.900]   If you read anything in the area of human psychology,
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.340]   if you read in the area of sociology,
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:57.340]   you realize there is a preponderance
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.860]   of different views on where marriage came from.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:02.300]   Where did marriage come from?
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:07.060]   As soon as you roll the Bible
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.660]   and God's version of where marriage came from
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.220]   out of the picture, then you've gotta come up
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.580]   with some kind of theory, where did it come from?
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:20.220]   Well, for them, marriage really is a result
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.560]   of man's planning and design.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:27.220]   And that's why I've included in your notes there
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.980]   the United Nations' view on the family.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.580]   You read through that and it sounds,
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.700]   on the surface, really nice.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.460]   Well, the United Nations has a view on the family,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.400]   but the way that they define a family
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.580]   is any three or four people living together
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.140]   in one proximity is a family.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.580]   So a whole bunch of hobos in a boxcar
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.580]   constitutes a family for them.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.300]   Whether they're related or not doesn't matter.
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.300]   Whether they're married or not really doesn't matter.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.780]   A family is such, so, if a family can mean anything,
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:57.880]   then it means nothing.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:02.160]   If it can mean anything, it means nothing.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.660]   And if you read some of the theories that are out there,
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.260]   where did marriage come from?
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.660]   That's the big question.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.780]   How did we get this?
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.780]   Well, they would say, in essence,
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.820]   it is really an evolutionary caveman type of an arrangement.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.540]   That's where marriage came from.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.220]   It's an evolutionary caveman invention.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:34.140]   That back during prehistoric times,
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:40.300]   there were two guys, one by the name of Bog,
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:44.500]   and the other one by the name of Gog, all right?
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.000]   And Bog and Gog got together in a big cave.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.740]   And Bog said to Gog,
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:57.940]   ooh, can't tell your wife and kids
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:01.220]   from my wife and kids.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:07.300]   Gog said, ooh, you right, what's a wife?
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:14.860]   Bog says, ooh, don't know, a woman whom you're with.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:22.820]   Ooh, Gog says, okay, what do we do?
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:28.380]   Bog says, ooh, I got idea.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:34.380]   You grab a woman by hair, drag her to nearby cave,
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:41.500]   and all of her children will follow her,
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.980]   and I'll stay here with my woman,
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:49.020]   and her children will stay here,
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.540]   and we will have marriage, family.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.140]   And Gog says, ooh, sounds like good idea.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:04.700]   So Gog grabs nearby woman by hair,
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.580]   drags her to nearby cave, and now they have family.
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.020]   And it works well because that environment
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.020]   is a hunting, agricultural environment,
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.100]   and you need family and kids to be able
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.860]   to run these little teeny prehistoric farms
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.780]   and to do hunting, and that works very, very well.
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.820]   But now in our high-tech society
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:36.980]   with the sophistication of modern technology,
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.940]   we don't need that anymore.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.700]   That is a thing that was good for prehistoric times
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:47.100]   or ancient times, but that's not good for now, see?
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:53.860]   And I want you to understand that they believe
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:58.020]   that man somewhere in prehistoric times
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.920]   invented the concept of marriage.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:07.740]   Now, what you believe about the origin of marriage
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:12.740]   has a huge effect on how marriages to function.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:19.940]   It has huge implications
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.620]   on how people are supposed to get along in marriage.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:34.660]   So we would say this, that if man developed marriage,
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:40.500]   then man can destroy marriage, or let's say it like this.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.900]   If man developed or invented marriage,
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.220]   then man can redefine marriage any day
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.780]   or any time he wants.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.260]   So if two males want to live together
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.740]   and we call that marriage, that's okay.
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.020]   If two females want to live together
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.020]   and call that marriage, that's okay, too.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:07.340]   There's even a movement in a lot of Western cultures
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:12.340]   where if you want to marry your cat or your dog,
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.460]   I mean, on an evolutionary scale in terms of mammals,
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.740]   it's not really that far away.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:23.740]   But if you want to marry your horse or your donkey,
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.840]   that's okay.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:32.580]   You're a narrow-minded, fundamentalist, bigoted person
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.320]   if you think that that's bad.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.500]   You're just not as sophisticated as us.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.140]   You have too rigid of definitions.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   You're not really able to think with the depth
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:57.580]   that we can think and understand the subtle nuances
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.100]   of life and marriage the way we understand
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:03.660]   the subtle nuances of life and marriage.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.340]   Marriage was okay.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.900]   The traditional marriage was okay
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.740]   during an agricultural caveman time.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.660]   That was all right.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.440]   But in our sophisticated technological society today,
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.000]   it's no longer the preferred arrangement anymore.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.260]   So we can redefine it any way we want.
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:26.260]   If man invented marriage,
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.500]   then he can define it any way he wants.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:36.060]   So bog and gog are all old-fashioned.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:42.840]   Out of date, unimportant anymore is the idea.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.240]   But obviously, we know that that's not
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.640]   where marriage came from.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:54.120]   The Bible talks about marriage being given by God.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   Genesis 1:26-27.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.560]   It was not man who invented marriage.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.240]   It was God who invented marriage.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   I want you to grab your Bible
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.560]   and go back there for a moment.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.000]   Let's take a look at this.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.280]   Then God said, "Let us make man in our image
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.360]   "according to our likeness,
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.880]   "and let them rule over the fish of the sea
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.000]   "and over the birds of the sky
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.640]   "and over the cattle and over all the earth
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.880]   "and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.880]   "And God created man in his own image.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.840]   "In the image of God, he created him.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.160]   "Male and female, he created them.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.280]   "And God blessed them," verse 28,
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.160]   "and said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.580]   "'and fill the earth and subdue it
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.080]   "'and rule over the fish of the sea
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.340]   "'and over the birds of the sky
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.440]   "'and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'"
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.200]   Wow.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.320]   Now, notice in verse 26,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.200]   there's a play on singular and plural
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.840]   going on here in the Hebrew.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.600]   You can see it even in the English.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:55.160]   Let us, plural, make man singular
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.960]   in our plural image, singular,
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.960]   according to our plural likeness, singular.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:08.680]   Let them, plural, rule over the fish of the sea
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.600]   and over the birds of the sky
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.800]   and over the cattle and over all the earth
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.400]   and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.600]   So what's going on here?
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:22.160]   The let us, as most theologians believe,
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.080]   this is the earliest reference we have to the Trinity,
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.920]   God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.080]   It's not a reference primarily the angels.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.920]   It's a reference to God because the angels
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.680]   are not our creators.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.940]   God's our creator.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:43.480]   Let us make man.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.300]   So we could say this,
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:53.300]   that God here, in verse 26, in relationship,
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.580]   creates man in relationship with gender distinctiveness.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:05.100]   God in relationship creates man in relationship
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.540]   with gender distinctiveness
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.920]   and gives them a cultural mandate.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.720]   He blessed them and he said to them,
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.480]   be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth and subdue it.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:23.020]   So now children become part of the blessing of God.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   Children are not the requirement of marriage.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.360]   They are part of the blessing of marriage.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.960]   We'll come back to that later
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.560]   when it comes to the definition.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.560]   So God in triunity now creates man in bi-unity,
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:59.160]   male and female with gender distinctiveness
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.560]   complementary of each other
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.640]   in order to fulfill the mandate of being unified as one.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:16.360]   God is still one person manifested,
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.480]   or three persons in one essence, onological essence.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.440]   And hence you have the tri-unity of God.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.840]   Yes, Ruben.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.720]   >> Some people who hear, they say that it is true
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.120]   that that relationship is between a male and a female.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.600]   However, the passage is not talking about marriage itself
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.840]   as we understand marriage today.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:45.080]   So they use it, in fact, to defend the view,
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.280]   the view of, well, I can't get together with my girlfriend
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.520]   and they're still living together
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.960]   because marriage as we see it today
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.800]   is just a cultural thing.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.320]   >> I'll defend it from the standpoint,
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.440]   and another, let me see if I can repeat the question,
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.080]   so for the videotape, and that is,
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.320]   people who object to that particular view and say,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.320]   well, that's not the way we understand marriage today,
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.240]   what's being reflected here in Genesis 1, 26, 27.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:18.720]   So therefore I can get together with my girlfriend
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.080]   who I'm not married to and that's okay
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.880]   because that seems to be reflective.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.680]   I mean, there's no talk about a husband and wife directly
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.760]   or just male and female, God created them
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.120]   in a heterosexual relationship.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.040]   Is that basically what you're saying?
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.400]   Well, Genesis chapter one is a quick snapshot
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.000]   at everything that happened in general creation.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   But Genesis chapter two is now a flashback to day six
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.360]   where he gives us much more detail.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.480]   And I would say the Bible reflects the fact
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:53.020]   that there is a marital relationship
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.880]   that has taken place between Adam and Eve
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.100]   because we go back to the actual details
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.160]   of how they came about.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.960]   And I'll talk about that a little bit later, all right?
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.000]   Just hang in there and we'll get there
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.220]   to Genesis chapter two, okay?
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.080]   In fact, I wanna suggest to you,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.520]   and we'll talk about this eventually,
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.760]   that verse 23 of Genesis two
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   is actually the first marital vows, all right?
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.600]   First marital vows are right there.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.560]   Taken before God and before all the hosts of heaven.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.960]   And Adam's the one who says it.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.660]   Now, I'll break down why that's the case.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.080]   So marriage is given by God.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.220]   And the critical point here is if God created marriage,
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.640]   then he has answers for marriage when it gets into trouble,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.440]   which means there's hope.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.280]   Wow, I like that.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.720]   If God created marriage,
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.560]   it means there's answers for marriage
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.840]   when it gets into trouble,
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.420]   which means that there is hope.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:55.400]   If man created marriage,
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.400]   there's not a whole lot of hope for marriage.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.720]   But if God created marriage, there's all kinds of hope.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.520]   So that's why I say what you believe
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.640]   about the origin of marriage
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.240]   directly affects how you think about marriage
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.080]   and how you resolve problems in marriage.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.320]   What do you believe about the origin of marriage?
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.080]   Where did it come from?
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.840]   Did it come from Bog and Gog?
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.520]   Or did it come as a result of God's purposeful revelation,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.600]   especially of himself, the man?
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.920]   God in relationship create, and yet essentially one,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.200]   creates man in relationship as essentially one.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.000]   Male and female, he creates them.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.640]   They're distinct in that they're one.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.000]   They're man, and yet they're mankind
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   manifested in a gender complementary fashion.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.320]   So that then tells us here number two
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:10.880]   that celibacy then is not the norm,
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.400]   never was intended from the beginning.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.000]   It's not more holy to be celibate.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.720]   Celibacy was never intended to be the norm.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:32.880]   You're not somehow more godly because you're celibate.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.880]   You're actually reflecting better the triunity of God
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.080]   by a plurality of relationship
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.400]   brought together into one marriage.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.600]   As he later on says in Genesis 2:24,
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.620]   "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.160]   "and be united to his wife,
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.840]   "and they shall become one flesh."
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.400]   That becomes the covenant of marriage, one flesh.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:11.640]   Well, marriage is not to be disparaged either.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.680]   We can see from this that it is holy and honorable
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.000]   because it was created by God.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   Anytime we disparage marriage or talk negatively about it,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.960]   we're actually talking negatively
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.320]   about something that God has established.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.840]   We also see from this that sex and procreation
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   is a part of marriage and that gender distinctiveness
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.720]   is not just called good, but after Eve is created,
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.920]   verse 31, God saw all that he had made
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.720]   and behold, it was very good.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.440]   That's really quite remarkable.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.680]   The first day of creation, God created everything
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.520]   and he called it good.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.600]   Second day, he called it good.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.440]   Third day, good.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.400]   Fourth day, good.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.240]   Fifth day, good.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.720]   Sixth day, what's he say?
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.720]   It's not good that man be alone, Genesis 2:18.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.080]   The sixth day, God says for the first time, it's not good
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.200]   that man be alone.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.560]   I will make a helper suitable for him.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.720]   Then Eve is created and then it says,
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:17.160]   and God saw all that he had made
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.600]   and then it was very good.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.840]   Eve, if you will, becomes the crowning point of creation
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.560]   and that's good.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:29.680]   It's the last thing he does and then he rests.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.440]   So sex and creation is a part of marriage.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.640]   Gender distinctiveness now is a very good thing.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.000]   So God didn't, you know, you've heard the old story.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.220]   God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, okay?
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.920]   So God didn't create same sex
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.400]   because they can't complement one another.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   They just redundantly reflect one another.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.480]   No, it created distinctive sexuality.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.480]   Furthermore, marriage is not to compete
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.400]   with human options or substitutes.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.480]   This is the way God created it from the very beginning.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.280]   And marriage ultimately is the picture
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.280]   of Christ's relationship to his bride, the church.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.080]   It teaches an important spiritual reality
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.200]   about God's relationship to his people.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.000]   So now marriage becomes a valuable object lesson
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.920]   in understanding that rich dynamic
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.920]   between the husband and his wife, the church,
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.160]   or even in the Old Testament,
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   God is the husbandman and Israel was his bride.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:56.280]   So we understand better of that relationship
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.120]   because we understand the husband and wife relationship.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.120]   Now, in Genesis 2, in verse 18,
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   we find the original purpose of marriage.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.640]   What was the original purpose of marriage?
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   Verse 18 says, "It was not good that man be alone."
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:21.880]   The Hebrew here, to be alone,
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:28.060]   indicated the fact that man was by himself
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.980]   and this was not good.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.680]   This is the first time in God's creation
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.500]   that God called something not good
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.220]   because it was not complete.
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:46.620]   So God creates Eve not primarily to produce babies,
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:51.260]   even though that's one of the blessing of marriage.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.740]   God produced Eve not to be a housewife.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:17:01.500]   God gave Eve to Adam not as another income producer
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.580]   in the home.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:10.240]   God gave Eve to Adam as a companion.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:15.460]   The issue was loneliness.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.540]   So at the very heart of marriage,
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.300]   this gender distinctiveness is good,
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.780]   it's very good because of companionship
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.300]   and now companionship becomes the focus
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.700]   and the purpose of marriage.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.660]   It's always interesting for me
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.060]   that when a marriage gets into trouble
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.860]   and starts having serious problems,
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.940]   that's the first thing that goes out the window,
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940]   is companionship.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.820]   Then in verses 19 through 23,
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.500]   we begin to see that God creates
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.260]   the original partners in marriage.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:59.020]   And in fact, in verse 19, it says,
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.660]   "Out of the ground, God formed every beast of the field
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.640]   "and every bird of the sky and brought them to the man
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.840]   "to see what he would call them
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.400]   "and whatever he called a living creature,
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.980]   "that was its name.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.880]   "And the man gave names to all the cattle
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.960]   "and all the birds of the sky
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.080]   "and to every beast of the field,
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.600]   "but for Adam, there was not found
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.380]   "a helper suitable for him."
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:17.580]   So sandwiched between verse 18
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.460]   and the latter part of verse 19,
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.180]   where it talks about there was no suitable helper for Adam,
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:23.740]   is all this naming the animals.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.480]   Well, why does that occur?
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.980]   Well, imagine if you're Adam.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:31.100]   You spend your entire first day on this planet by yourself
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.020]   naming all of these animals
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.420]   that are passing in front of you.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:37.020]   By the way, that shows the super intelligence of Adam
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.900]   because we still haven't named all the animals
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.500]   on this planet, even with our supercomputers,
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.960]   and we're still finding animals, naming them,
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.740]   but Adam was able to name them all in one 24-hour day
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.220]   and remember distinctively all of those names,
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.840]   shows you super intelligence.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.580]   No man could ever hope to do that now.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.600]   We have devolved, not evolved.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.700]   We've devolved and turned to intelligence
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.700]   from the first Adam.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:06.220]   So he's able to do this in one 24-hour period,
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:14.440]   but there was not found a helper suitable for him,
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.840]   and the word helper suitable
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.360]   is the words in Hebrew, ezer kanigno.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   There was not found an ezer kanigno for Adam.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:25.960]   A fitting completer, ideally suited for him.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.400]   I used to call my wife, Janie, my little ezer kanigno,
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.100]   and people thought I was cursing at her, I think,
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.440]   but it was a term of endearment, all right?
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.360]   An ezer kanigno, ideally suited.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.740]   So you see, the animals would not do.
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.560]   God didn't create a father for Adam, a mother for Adam,
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.020]   a child for Adam, a sister for Adam,
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.920]   a brother for Adam, a playmate for Adam.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.720]   He didn't create a golfing buddy for Adam.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.140]   He created a wife for Adam.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.640]   That's what he did,
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.080]   who was going to be a fitting completer,
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.580]   a suitable helper, ideally suited for him.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:10.080]   Now, after you've been naming animals all day long
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.960]   and you see Mr. and Mrs. Hippopotamus pass in front of you
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.980]   and Mr. and Mrs. Elephant and Mr. and Mrs. Giraffe
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:18.000]   and Mr. and Mrs. Skunk and Mr. and Mrs. Gerbil,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.240]   when you see all of that pass in front of you,
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.800]   at the end of the day, you say,
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:29.240]   Lord, how come there's no one that corresponds to me?
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:36.700]   So it was a vivid object lesson for Adam that he was alone.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.700]   Even Mr. and Mrs. Dog passed in front of Adam.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:45.600]   The dog is not man's best friend.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.440]   Adam was still alone.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:54.660]   So Adam was alone and he knew it.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.920]   He felt it at the end of the day.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.060]   So God causes him to go to sleep.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:04.440]   He takes the rib out of Adam.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.040]   Like John MacArthur says, Adam goes to sleep single,
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040]   wakes up married.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:18.600]   And he creates Eve from the rib that he had taken out.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.600]   Why does he cause him to go to sleep?
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.240]   'Cause I do believe there was pain prior to marriage,
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.160]   or prior to the fall.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.020]   It's just that pain is multiplied after the fall,
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:33.520]   as we're gonna see later on in Genesis 3 and verse 15,
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.960]   or verse 16, I should say.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.700]   We'll take a look at the Hebrew of that.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.160]   Pain is multiplied.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:48.200]   So now God has created Eve for Adam as a companion,
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:53.480]   and that becomes the purpose of marriage.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:57.240]   So now he says, now grab your Bible
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.720]   and look at this real closely.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.920]   After Adam wakes up, he brings Eve to her,
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.720]   to him, I should say.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.320]   And verse 23, then Adam said,
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.320]   "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.080]   "She shall be called woman because she was taken out a man."
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.080]   The question is, what is going on there?
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.960]   The only other time that this Hebrew phraseology is used
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.240]   is in 2 Samuel chapter five and verse one.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.040]   It's where the people of Israel come to David
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.040]   and say, "Bone of bones, flesh of flesh."
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.280]   What are they doing there?
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.560]   They're actually performing a coronation service
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.080]   to coronate David as king over Israel.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.000]   And they're saying, "Bone of bones, flesh of flesh.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.440]   "You're a part of us, we're a part of you."
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.860]   They're swearing their allegiance to David.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.800]   That's what they're doing.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.440]   2 Samuel 5, one.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.840]   So what is Adam doing here before God
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.440]   and all the hosts of heaven?
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.300]   This is a vow of loyalty.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.200]   It's a vow of companionship.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.520]   He's swearing his allegiance to Eve,
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.200]   which is incredibly remarkable
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.720]   because Eve doesn't have any competition.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.920]   There are no other women on the planet.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.880]   And yet, he swears his allegiance,
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.840]   bone of bones, flesh of flesh.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.320]   "She shall be called woman."
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.400]   And the root of the Hebrew word here
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.960]   is characteristic.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.200]   He calls her because what's he been doing all day long?
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.560]   His first day on earth, he's been aiming animals, right?
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.080]   Whole first day on earth, that's all he's been doing,
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:30.920]   he's been naming.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.080]   And usually, if he named an animal,
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.960]   the typical semantic way in which
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:41.520]   ancient Arab people would name things,
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.200]   they would name things based upon
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.880]   its most common characteristic.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.520]   And that's, I think, exactly what Adam does here
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.680]   with the woman because the root of the idea
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.560]   of the old, very ancient, archaic meaning
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.800]   of the word woman means soft.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.320]   Now, I don't know what he did,
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.160]   whether he went up to Eve and poked her
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:09.520]   and goes, "Whoa, soft."
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.920]   I don't know what happened there,
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:17.240]   but whatever he saw, it was soft.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.840]   And so, he says, "Now, bone of bones, flesh of flesh,
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.080]   "she shall be called softy
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.160]   "because she was taken out of man."
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.920]   Wow.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.800]   "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother,
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.320]   "be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh."
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.760]   Which now brings us to the very covenantal bond of marriage.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.320]   Later on in Proverbs 2:17, Malachi 2:14,
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.640]   it's called a barit or a covenant.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.460]   To cut a covenant, when two people made an agreement,
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.080]   they would take an animal and slice it in two
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.840]   and walk between it, in essence saying,
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.540]   "If we were to ever break this agreement,
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.200]   "may God do unto us what has been done to this animal."
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.720]   That's what they would do to cut a covenant.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.220]   So, marriage now becomes a covenant.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:05.720]   Marriage was considered a sacred, unbreakable bond,
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.520]   a lasting lifetime commitment.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.880]   That's what God intended it to be.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:19.600]   And then, it constitutes, then, a leaving
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:25.360]   this marriage was considered the sacred, unbreakable bond,
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.300]   a lasting lifetime commitment.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.200]   Then, it constitutes an essential unity,
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.920]   which involves leaving father and mother.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.400]   There was no father and mother at this time,
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.600]   but God still lays it out, which tells me
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.680]   that from the very beginning,
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.640]   God designed the parent-child relationship to be temporary,
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.920]   and that the husband and wife relationship
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.920]   was to be permanent.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.620]   Now, you know, that is incredibly significant,
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:26:01.840]   because in a lot of homes today that are Christian homes,
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.560]   you got Mary and Tom, they're married together,
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.240]   and this is their home.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.920]   And I can remember, as a pastor several years ago,
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.280]   meeting with a group of pastors,
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.480]   and we recognized a phenomenon that was going on,
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.400]   and that is, after Mary and Tom had raised children,
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.460]   and 25 years into marriage, all of a sudden,
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.920]   to the shock of everybody in the church,
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.620]   they're announcing that they're getting a divorce.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.080]   Why was this going on?
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.480]   And we were sitting as pastors,
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.320]   discussing this kind of thing,
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.040]   and it dawned on us at the time,
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.740]   in a lot of these homes where this was happening,
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.840]   had for years been homeschooling homes.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.680]   Now, I'm not against homeschooling.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.520]   We homeschooled our kids for several years,
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.720]   so don't get that idea.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.320]   But there was a phenomenon we began to see,
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.400]   and that is, when little Mary,
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.440]   becomes the center of the home,
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.840]   and she's number one,
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:22.980]   and oftentimes, a homeschooling home,
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.600]   and it doesn't just have to be a homeschooling home.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.840]   Give me other homes, too.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.800]   Then, over the years, everything in that home
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.420]   revolves around the kids.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.180]   Then, that's a child-centered home.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:39.400]   And all of a sudden, Mary starts to grow up,
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.480]   and she no longer is a part of that home.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.800]   She runs off to college,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.640]   or she gets married, or something happens like that.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.680]   Now, Mom and Dad, and once the kids are gone,
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.040]   look at each other and say, wow, we've done our job.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.000]   We really don't have much of a relationship
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.120]   that's left because we've made
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.740]   little or no investment in it.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.860]   Then, they get a divorce, and that home fractures.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:07.260]   That's what happens to child-centered homes.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:09.200]   God never intended that to be the case.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.600]   Children were to be number two,
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.920]   and the husband and wife relationship
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.860]   was intended to be number one.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:23.920]   Mary's relationship to Tom took first place.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:27.860]   Tom's relationship to Mary took first place,
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:32.860]   and the kids, little Mary and little Tommy,
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:38.560]   were always to be number two.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.600]   You're raising little Tommy and little Mary
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.760]   to leave the home, not stay in the home.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.860]   From the very beginning.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:53.760]   That's why God says, it is here,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.700]   "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother,
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:03.120]   "and be joined," or united, "to his wife."
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.560]   Children are intended to be reared,
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.280]   to leave the home, not stay in the home.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.940]   Cleave to one another, which means to weld together.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:14.200]   In fact, the whole idea behind the Hebrew word here
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.540]   actually means to be glued together.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.880]   I'm sure if they would've had this in the ancient times,
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.720]   they would've called it super-glued together.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.360]   You ever get super-glue on your hands
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.680]   and try to tear it apart and take some of the skin with it?
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.800]   That's the way marriage should be.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.080]   They should be super-glued together
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.340]   and become one flesh.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.720]   That means they become one physically,
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.200]   but it goes beyond that.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.060]   One in their parenting, one in their view of finances.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:50.320]   They need to be super-glued together.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.760]   Our first year of marriage, I realized that.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:59.820]   One day I was shopping and I had $50 in my pocket.
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.000]   That was a lot of money back then.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.200]   Let's see, that's over 32, 33 years ago now.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.160]   So I had a lot of, I had a lot of money.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.360]   It was 50 bucks, and I need a new coat,
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.240]   and I saw one that I really wanted for the winter,
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:18.080]   and it was on half-price sale, 50 bucks.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.360]   And I bought it and took it home.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.480]   I showed it to Janie, and she looked at it,
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.760]   and she says, "Wow, that's really nice, John.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.760]   "Where'd you get the money for that?"
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.000]   I said, "Well, I had $50 in my pocket."
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.120]   When I was a single guy, I used to be able to go out
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.920]   and spend that $50, and then I'd just skip a few meals.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.760]   All right?
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.040]   She had designs on that $50 in my pocket.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.600]   You know, it wasn't really important stuff
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.880]   like paying the rent and buying groceries,
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.080]   and not really important stuff.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:49.840]   When I was a single guy, I'd just make do.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.000]   But now, even though I was married,
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.360]   I still fought as a single person.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.400]   I viewed that money as mine, not ours.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:05.020]   Becoming one means viewing things like that as ours.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.800]   We are one.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.740]   That's a radical change.
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:13.020]   That's not my money anymore.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.740]   I don't have anything that's my money.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:15.580]   It's our money.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:19.020]   We have one income coming into our household,
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:22.580]   and we have to decide, which is a reflection of our unity,
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:24.420]   how we're gonna budget ourselves
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:27.020]   so that we can spend that one bit of money.
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:31.340]   And as we work that out in common agreement,
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:33.500]   that unifies our marriage together.
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.300]   So a budget, a financial budget,
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:39.660]   it's actually an expression of good marital unity.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.300]   It's not a place where you have war.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.380]   It's unity.
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.780]   It's a reflection of unity.
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.460]   The better you're able to work out that budget,
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:49.800]   the more unified you are.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:54.300]   So you get the idea here
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.020]   that the husband-wife relationship
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.780]   God intended from the very beginning
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.940]   to be number one.
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.080]   The children are number two,
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.780]   and children are to be reared to leave that home.
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:07.780]   And then you begin to function as one flesh,
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:14.380]   as an entity being joined together.
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.540]   That's the reason why Reuben and I said what I did
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.740]   about answering your question.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.940]   That chapter two defines what we still believe today
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:31.580]   about a real marital relationship.
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.420]   Cohabitating together is not what Genesis 1
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:35.300]   is talking about.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:41.460]   Where there's a definite public declaration
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:44.420]   of loyalty and companionship together
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:48.060]   that is permanent, where you have left father and mother,
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.860]   and you're cleaving to one another
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:52.440]   defines the very essence of what marriage is.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.040]   Yes, go ahead.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.760]   - Now in Spain we have this situation
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.640]   where you don't have to get married.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.000]   You can live together with your partner,
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.880]   but you sign sort of like a marital contract,
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.040]   which is that public manifestation.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:11.040]   So you have all the rights as people of marriage
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.600]   that you are not.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.720]   And whenever you feel like, oh, I need to break this up,
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.600]   you just go sign another paper,
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:21.320]   and you're free to go necessarily back.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.040]   And that's coming to the church,
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.520]   and a lot of so-called Christians,
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.680]   they understand that as marriages.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:30.280]   - Yeah, that's what we would call here
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.680]   in this culture being semi-married.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.860]   In other words, you have a temporary arrangement,
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:39.640]   but you can back out of it any time, all right?
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.920]   You have all the technical rights of marriage
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.080]   from a legal standpoint, but you can back out of it,
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.560]   which is really no vow of loyalty at all.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.760]   It's just a temporary arrangement.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.200]   - How do you find that?
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.960]   Because in one sense, it is true
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.360]   that how we get married today,
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.640]   a great part of that is coming--
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.520]   - Yeah, how do you find that understanding?
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.280]   I think that you need to talk about marriage
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.760]   as being a permanent lifetime relationship,
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.500]   a sacred covenant.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:15.800]   You need to stress the covenantal nature of marriage.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.920]   And stress Adam's vow, bone of bones, flesh of flesh.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.180]   He vows his loyalty to her.
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:28.420]   To get rid of her is to get rid of my left arm.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.540]   Not gonna do that.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.720]   Jim?
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.840]   - I was just gonna ask you about the words translated wife,
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.720]   at least in the New American Standard in verses 24 and 25.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.960]   For this reason, the man shall leave his father and mother
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.940]   and be joined to his wife.
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.200]   Verse 25, the man and his wife will go naked.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.960]   - Is that, I think it's Isha.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.480]   Does anybody have a Hebrew here?
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.320]   - That's right, it's Isha.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.360]   - Isha, it's Isha.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:01.360]   They've, and it's legitimate to translate Isha as wife.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:07.500]   That's legitimate to do, but it can also mean woman.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.800]   All right, but they translate it

[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.960]   In front of it, his woman, which usually means wife.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:23.640]   Okay, so to bring it into modern English,
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.840]   we would say his wife.
