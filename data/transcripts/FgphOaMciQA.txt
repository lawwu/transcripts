[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Welcome back to another week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   David writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John, in the wake of recent terrorist attacks
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.280]   around the globe and the rise of violence targeted more or less directly at Christians
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.600]   and the daily reality of us Western Christians is changing.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.540]   We've been accustomed to relative peace and safety here in Europe, but it seems that times
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.480]   are quickly shifting.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.220]   That which used to be considered reasonably safe is now becoming increasingly risky, like
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.780]   travel or attending a concert.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.380]   This leads us to re-evaluate our behavior.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.460]   Should we just trust in God's providence, maybe pray, and act as if nothing was happening,
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.260]   that is, continue our travel as before, continue to visit our public venues as before, or is
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.820]   there some reasonable level of caution that we should apply?
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.260]   And in more general terms, what is the difference between wise biblical caution and a fearfulness
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.580]   of unbelief, or to put it another way, what marks the difference between courage and foolishness?"
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.900]   The first principle that I would lay down is the greater the cause, the greater the
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.500]   risk.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.220]   God never calls us to risk our lives for meaningless or silly or merely recreational thrills, but
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.380]   he has regularly called his children to risk their lives, and often lose their lives, for
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.980]   the sake of the gospel, or to bring blessing to other people.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.900]   So that's the first thing to think about.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.560]   When the cause is great, risks are warranted.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.100]   Great risks are warranted.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.580]   Second thing to ponder is that the Bible presents faithful discipleship as something or sometimes
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.180]   standing firm in the face of danger and other times fleeing to avoid danger.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.180]   John Bunyan wrote a whole book about this called "Counsel to Sufferers," in which he
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.060]   shared his own struggle about whether to stay in jail for preaching the gospel or get out
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.660]   of jail and take care of his family, which he could have done and thus minimize the risks
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.740]   to their lives.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:35.380]   And he pointed out that the Bible allows for sometimes standing and suffering and other
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.700]   times fleeing and avoiding suffering.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.100]   And it seems to me that he's right, that there's no clear biblical rule that has any precision
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.920]   anyway for when to do the one and when to do the other, except maybe as the Spirit leads.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.260]   Sometimes faith stands in the face of threat, like Paul, stoned in Lystra, gets up, goes
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.100]   right on to preach in Derby, and you want to say, "Paul, you're going to meet the same
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.820]   mobs a few miles away.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.300]   Come on, take a vacation or take a break."
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.020]   And he doesn't.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.860]   Or nevertheless, Paul escaped from Damascus in a basket through the window because he
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.300]   was not going to face down those enemies at the gate who were ready to kill him.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.260]   So why escape through a window one day and walk right into danger another day?
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.300]   But we might find some guidance if we ponder a few other things.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:55.140]   For example, we should ask, "Is our fleeing or, in general, our caution for the sake of
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.980]   the gospel, for the sake of advancing the gospel and helping people to see the value
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.980]   of the gospel and believe the gospel, or is our fleeing or our caution simply an expression
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.420]   of our instinctive desire for self-preservation?"
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.780]   I'm not saying that it's always wrong to act for self-preservation.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.180]   Clearly it isn't in view of what we just saw from Paul.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:34.940]   I'm asking us to test our hearts as to whether we're being motivated merely by self-preservation
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:43.380]   or whether the advancement of the gospel and the glorification of Christ are figuring significantly
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.820]   in the choices that we're making when we pursue caution.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.820]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.980]   I'm pushing to consider seriously those higher goals rather than just self-preservation.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.140]   Or another factor, we might ask—and I base this question on 1 Peter 3:15—"Does our
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:11.900]   behavior in caution or risk, does our behavior tend to encourage people to ask us about our
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.460]   hope and why it's in heaven?"
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.420]   1 Peter 3:15 says, "Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you a reason
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.940]   for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect."
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.100]   Why do people ask about the reason for your hope?
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.500]   And it's because your behavior, your attitudes, your joy in difficult situations look as though
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.900]   you have a treasure that's different from theirs.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.500]   Theirs is in money and safety and security and health and family, and you seem to act
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.740]   with such courage and abandon and freedom and joy in the midst of danger.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.100]   Where's your hope?
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.140]   And I'm saying that it wouldn't hurt for us to ask the question whether our lifestyle
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.540]   and our attitudes are the kind of thing that might cause someone to ask about our hope
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.500]   in heaven.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:10.000]   And the last thing to say would be that we seriously consider this biblical truth, namely
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.540]   fearlessness in the face of danger is a great witness to the reality of Christ.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:25.280]   I see that in 1 Peter 3, 5, and 6 where wives are told to be fearless, but I read it recently
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:34.340]   in the book, "The Insanity of God," in a story about a 24-year-old widow, Muslim background
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:43.300]   convert, Aisha, who was arrested for being so outspoken in her Islamic town and put in
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:51.540]   the basement of the police station, unfinished cellar, and at the point where she felt she
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.780]   could stand it no more and was about to scream, instead, to her surprise, out of her mouth
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.820]   came a heart song of praise to Christ.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:10.200]   And as she sang in the dark cellar, silence happened upstairs and she could tell they
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   were listening.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.340]   And that night, the police chief came down and said that he was taking her home on one
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.020]   condition, "You must come to my house in three days."
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.060]   And then he said, "I don't understand you," this is a direct quote from the book, "I don't
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.060]   understand.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.220]   You're not afraid of anything.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:36.600]   My wife and daughters and all the women I know are afraid of everything.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.020]   You are not afraid of anything.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:46.340]   I want you to come to my house so that you can tell everyone why you're not afraid, and
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.380]   I want you to sing that song."
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:59.420]   So even though the Bible doesn't draw a simple, precise line between wise biblical caution,
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:07.480]   fearfulness of unbelief, it seems to me it certainly encourages us to lean in the direction
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.980]   of going about our business joyfully, peacefully, in faith, in God's sovereignty, rather than
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.740]   acting in fearful ways.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.300]   Boy, it sure does.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.860]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.380]   And David, thank you for the excellent question.
