[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   A really sharp podcast listener named Rachel writes in today, and she seems quite familiar
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.600]   with Christian hedonism.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.540]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.960]   The world tells us that we can only be real if we obey our native desires.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.520]   That's obviously wrong because our natural desires are for sin and for what will only
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.520]   destroy our joy in the end."
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.040]   But in response, I hear a lot of people in the church simply offering prohibitions, various
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.560]   forms of "don't trust your desires" or "don't follow your heart."
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.720]   And yet, if I understand Christian hedonism correctly, the Bible calls all people everywhere
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.000]   to follow their hearts toward the greatest and most lasting joy in the universe.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.960]   That seems to be how you define faith, in fact, finding Jesus more satisfying than anything
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.000]   else.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.840]   So it would be impossible for us to genuinely believe if we acted toward Christ in a way
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920]   contrary to our own hearts and our own desires.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.720]   So wouldn't the Christian hedonist say something like, "Do trust your desires and do trust
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.180]   your heart when your hearts and desires are calibrated to Christ."
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.420]   At what point do we trust our hearts and follow our desires?
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.560]   The blanket prohibitions seem inaccurate to me.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560]   Right.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560]   Yes.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.200]   They are inaccurate, unless they're just calculated rhetorical devices to get your
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.320]   attention, which sometimes they are.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.600]   Rachel really seems to know her way around in Christian hedonism.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.320]   I'm impressed.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.540]   The two fundamental statements of Christian hedonism are, one, God is most glorified in
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.700]   us when we're most satisfied in Him, and two, therefore, let's all pursue our largest
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.480]   and longest satisfaction in God, the largest being full, really full, and the longest being
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   forever.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.120]   And of course, we know where that comes from.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.360]   Psalm 1611, "In your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forever
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.200]   more."
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.600]   One of the implications of these two statements is that perpetual pursuit of God that does
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.680]   not come from joy in God will not honor God.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.560]   You might pursue God for all kinds of reasons that don't glorify God.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.620]   You might pursue Him for money.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220]   You might pursue Him for marriage.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.340]   You might pursue Him for job success.
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.020]   If God is just a divine butler to bring me what I really want besides God, then pursuing
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.760]   Him gets Him little glory.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.480]   What you glorify most is what you want most, not what you use to get what you want most.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.240]   You don't make God look majestic by making Him the means of something else that you want
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.540]   more.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.560]   And Rachel is right that I think an essential part of saving faith is to be satisfied with
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.720]   all that God is for us in Jesus, and so I think she's right to say that we can't
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.240]   genuinely believe, and I would add can't genuinely worship either, if the pursuit of
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.400]   God is always contrary to our heart.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   That's right.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.600]   Contrary to our heart means that our heart wants something else more, and we simply feel
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.240]   coerced into pursuing God lest something bad happen to us, or as a means to something good
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   that we want more than God.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.120]   So yes, yes, yes, it is essential, let's just call it, to be born again, and that from
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.200]   inside out we be given new preferences, new inclinations, new desires, especially a supreme
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   desire for God.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.440]   And when that essential thing happens, then we may say, perhaps without misunderstanding,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.920]   that we must follow our desires.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.320]   In other words, when we have been made new enough to have our strongest desires be for
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:28.680]   God, then we must follow them; otherwise, we will not only be inauthentic, but God will
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.400]   not be glorified.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.480]   Now what's missing from most contemporary declarations to follow our desires so that
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.120]   we will be authentic, or not to follow our desires because we will be sinful, what's
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.840]   missing is the serious consideration that our desires must be deeply and profoundly
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.960]   renovated.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.240]   This is offensive to unbelievers, and it's scary to some believers who think that they
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   should have the final say in controlling their own behavior.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   It's offensive to unbelievers because it says that they are deeply flawed, deeply flawed
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.800]   human beings, and need to have their most fundamental desires changed by God so that
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.320]   God is at the center of their wants and preferences and values.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.160]   And it's scary to some believers to say that our desires must be profoundly renovated
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.320]   by God because that renovation is not in our control.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.520]   And some people have a theology that says we have to be in control, else we're not
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   responsible.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.880]   That's not true.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.440]   God knows how to renovate and govern our hearts without taking away human responsibility.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:59.320]   Now Rachel was getting at this when she said that we should only pursue our desires if
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.680]   "our heart and desires are calibrated to Christ."
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   I like that phrase.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.240]   I use the word "renovation," she used the word "calibrated to Christ."
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.360]   Right, that's a huge "if," though.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.200]   If our heart and desires are calibrated to Christ, the greatest spiritual task—and
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:25.080]   I think she knows this—the greatest spiritual task of the Christian life is precisely that
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:36.440]   recalibration of our fallen desires, our disordered desires, our misdirected desires into godly,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.040]   orderly, properly directed desires.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.880]   This is where the great battle is fought in the Christian life.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.480]   Of course, indeed, we are taught to use self-control to abstain from external actions that are
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.680]   sinful, but that's not the main battle of the Christian life.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.480]   The main battle is to see our hearts renovated, recalibrated, so that we don't want to do
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.800]   those sinful external behaviors and don't just need willpower not to do them, but the
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.920]   root has been severed and we have different desires.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.880]   In other words, the goal of change, of sanctification of the Christian life is to be so changed
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.960]   that we can and ought to follow our desires.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.880]   Here's another way to say it.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.920]   Authentic living is freedom.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.640]   For freedom, Christ has set you free, Paul says in Galatians 5.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.080]   But what is true freedom?
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.760]   Let's think about this for just a minute.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.920]   When are you free, for example, to enjoy skydiving?
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.760]   Now one right answer is, well, when you have access to a plane and to some equipment that
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   you need.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   The freedom of access.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   Right.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.040]   Here's another right answer.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.920]   You have to have the ability to do it.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   You've got to have some training.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.220]   You've got to know what you're doing.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.160]   You know, the freedom of ability.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Right.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.000]   Here's another right answer.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.760]   You've got to have a desire to skydive.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.200]   You can't enjoy skydiving if you don't want to skydive.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.840]   Enjoyment means fulfilling your desire.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.000]   So there is the freedom of desire.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.760]   Now is that all?
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.400]   Access, ability, desire.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.000]   Is that what constitutes freedom?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.520]   No, that's not all.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.960]   There's one more aspect of freedom that hasn't been mentioned.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.820]   If you're going to freely enjoy skydiving, what if you have access and ability and desire
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:41.320]   and you leap out of the plane enjoying the hundred mile an hour wind in your goggled
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:49.380]   face until you realize there's no ripcord and in 30 seconds you'll be dead.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.540]   That first enjoyment of the wind in your face was not authentic freedom.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.540]   It was a delusion.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.040]   There was a missing dimension to this freedom.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.540]   We had freedom from lack of access, freedom from lack of ability, freedom from lack of
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.420]   desire, but we did not have freedom from regret.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:15.220]   So my definition of true freedom to enjoy something is that we need access and ability
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.540]   and desire and the certainty we will not regret this in a thousand years.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:32.140]   All of which is to say we may pursue our desires and we may trust our heart when our heart
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:41.420]   and desires are so renovated, so calibrated to Christ that we have no passions for the
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.500]   path that leads to regret.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   Very good.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.100]   That's the kind of freedom we should all seek after diligently, freedom to be enthralled
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.500]   by God's beauty.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   So much reminds me of John Donne's Holy Sonnet number 14.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   That kept coming to mind.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.180]   And thanks for joining us today on the podcast for our feed, our archive, or to send us your
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.100]   own question like this great question from Rachel.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.100]   Wow.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.100]   Thank you for it.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.820]   Do all of that from our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.500]   While some people assume that John Piper was born a Calvinist, nope.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.420]   In fact, his embrace of Reformed soteriology came at the expense of some very painful life
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.540]   experiences, one of which he'll share with us next time.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.380]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
