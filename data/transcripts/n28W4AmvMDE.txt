[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.680]   My guest today is Dr. Robert Lustig.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.080]   Dr. Robert Lustig is an endocrinologist.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.460]   That is, he's a specialist in the function of hormones
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.240]   in the body and a professor of pediatric endocrinology
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.720]   at the University of California, San Francisco.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.460]   He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed studies
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.560]   exploring how different types of nutrients,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.300]   that is food, impact our cellular functioning,
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.380]   our organ functioning, and thereby our health.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.040]   During today's discussion, we discuss the idea
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.980]   of whether or not a calorie is indeed a calorie
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980]   and whether or not our body weight and body composition
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.560]   only reflects the number of calories we eat
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.520]   versus the calories that we burn.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   We talk about how different food types,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.080]   that is how the different macronutrients, protein, fat,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.480]   and carbohydrates are processed in the body
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.460]   and the important role that fiber and the gut microbiome
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.720]   plays in that process.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.280]   And we pay particular attention to the topic
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.160]   of how different types of sugars and fructose in particular
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.140]   can indeed be addictive to the brain
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.040]   and can modify the way that hormones in the body,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.000]   in particular insulin, impact our liver health,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.620]   kidney health, and indeed the health
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.920]   of all of our cells and organs.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.640]   Indeed, Dr. Lustig is an expert in how sugar
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.760]   impacts the brain and body.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.040]   We talk about how certain types of sugars
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520]   can indeed be addictive in the same way
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   that certain drugs of abuse and behaviors
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.680]   can become addictive.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.520]   So in other words, how sugar actually changes the way
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.900]   that the brain works.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.200]   And we discuss how the food industry,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   that is the commoditization and sale
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.200]   of particular types of food has altered the way that we eat
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.580]   and indeed the foods that we crave.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.480]   Today's discussion covers all of that.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.340]   And by the end of today's discussion,
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.080]   you'll have a thorough understanding
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.820]   of how foods are processed when they enter your body
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.800]   and how those different food choices
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.840]   are impacting your immediate and long-term health.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.320]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.020]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.620]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.460]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.560]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.600]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.580]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.240]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.160]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.240]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.820]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.480]   Now, a key component of getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.080]   is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.920]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.560]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.320]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.640]   One of the best ways to make sure
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   that those temperature changes occur
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.920]   at the appropriate times, at the beginning and throughout,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.060]   and at the end of your night when you wake up,
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.600]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.720]   And that's what Eight Sleep allows you to do.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.060]   It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.160]   and sleeping environment such that you fall
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.560]   and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.000]   feeling incredibly refreshed and energized.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.800]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.160]   for almost three years now,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.020]   and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.800]   So much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.320]   or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my Eight Sleep,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.760]   I very much look forward to getting home
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.640]   because my sleep is always better
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.680]   when I sleep on my Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.000]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.940]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.120]   to get $150 off their pod three mattress cover.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.080]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.320]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.760]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.120]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.000]   how different foods affect your health
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.540]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.960]   One of the most important factors
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.560]   in your immediate and long-term health
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.480]   is your blood sugar or blood glucose regulation.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.800]   With Levels, you can see how different foods
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.220]   and food combinations, exercise, and sleep patterns
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.280]   impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.420]   It's very easy to use.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.360]   You just put the monitor on the back of your arm,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.660]   and then you take your phone
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.680]   and you scan it over that monitor now and again,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.440]   and it downloads the data about your blood sugar levels
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.040]   in the preceding hours.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.800]   Using Levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.320]   about what works best for me
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.220]   in terms of nutrition, exercise, work schedules, and sleep.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.040]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.240]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.580]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.200]   Levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.080]   and has even better tracking than the previous version.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.320]   Right now, they're also offering
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.600]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.200]   Again, that's levels.link/huberman
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.400]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.440]   but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.120]   I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago,
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.160]   and I've been using one ever since.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.880]   AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.880]   who was an engineer at Stanford.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.600]   And I knew of Alan because he had also built
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.580]   the so-called Aerobie Frisbee,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.540]   which I believe at one time, perhaps still now,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.520]   held the Guinness Book of World Records
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.580]   for furthest thrown object.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.860]   And I used to see Alan, believe it or not,
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.640]   at parks around Palo Alto,
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.540]   testing out different Aerobie Frisbees.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.400]   So he was sort of famous in our community
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.280]   for developing these different feats of engineering
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.120]   that turned into commercial products.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.220]   Now, I love coffee.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.360]   I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.680]   usually about 90 to 120 minutes
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.600]   after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.160]   Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.520]   I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.060]   But I love, love, love coffee.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.380]   And what I've personally found
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.020]   is that by using the AeroPress,
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.920]   I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.760]   I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.440]   that allows the same beans to be prepared
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.660]   into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.420]   as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.520]   even the traditional French press.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.740]   The AeroPress is extremely easy to use
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.640]   and it's extremely compact.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.700]   In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.240]   and I use it on the road in hotels,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.200]   even on planes, I'll just ask for some hot water
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.780]   and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.440]   If you'd like to try AeroPress,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.480]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman.

[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.940]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Robert Lustig.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.940]   Dr. Robert Lustig, welcome.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.780]   - Pleasure.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.780]   Truly, just being here, being invited,
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.040]   high honor, really appreciate it.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.080]   And it's not doctor, it's just Rob.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.560]   - Okay, Rob, I've been looking forward
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.880]   to this conversation for a long time.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.320]   I've seen your now famous, can we also say infamous,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.880]   but famous YouTube video about sugar.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.060]   We'll put a link to it in the show note captions.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.860]   It's been viewed many, many millions of times.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.380]   - Yeah, and I still can't figure out why that is, you know?
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.220]   - Well, I can.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.700]   - I didn't think my mother would watch it and she didn't,
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.400]   but 24 and a half million people did.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.120]   - Well, I think people are very interested
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.080]   in what to eat, what not to eat.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.360]   And we'll start off simply talking about
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.760]   what most everyone believes and understands,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.060]   which is that a calorie is a form of heat energy
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.340]   that's given off during the processing
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.980]   of some food bit or some thing.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.160]   If that's mysterious to people,
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.780]   just understand that a calorie is a unit of energy.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.880]   And I was taught and still many, many people
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.400]   worldwide believe that a calorie is a calorie,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.580]   meaning if I consume more calories in whatever form,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.480]   then I metabolize by thinking, feeling, moving,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.000]   exercising, et cetera, then I will gain weight.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.120]   And if I consume fewer calories than I burn,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.500]   I will lose weight.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.420]   And we could talk a lot about
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.920]   where that weight loss comes from.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.440]   Does it come from adipose body fat stores
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.180]   or from muscle or from protein,
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.880]   or muscle, of course, is protein, et cetera.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.280]   But let's start off with, is a calorie truly a calorie
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.240]   when it comes to the processing
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.320]   of different types of calories?
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.200]   Everyone thinks that obesity is about energy balance.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.240]   That is calories in, calories out.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.740]   Therefore, two behaviors, gluttony and sloth.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.060]   Therefore, if you're fat, it's your fault.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.240]   Therefore, diet and exercise.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.680]   Therefore, any calorie can be part of a balanced diet.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.080]   Therefore, don't pick on our calories,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.940]   go pick on somebody else's calories.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.620]   This is actually what the food industry uses
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.080]   to assuage their culpability
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.160]   for the change in the food supply
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   and the rise in obesity and chronic disease like diabetes.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.280]   Now, it is true that a calorie is that unit of energy
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:23.040]   that raises one gram of water one degree centigrade.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.720]   And so therefore, a calorie burned is a calorie burned.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.100]   I don't argue that, that's true.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.920]   That's the first law of thermodynamics.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   But that doesn't mean a calorie eaten is a calorie eaten.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.640]   That's not the same.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.040]   And that's where people get it wrong.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.360]   So let me give you some examples
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.820]   of how that calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.800]   You like almonds?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.680]   - I do.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.880]   - Me too, almonds are great.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.400]   You eat 160 calories in almonds.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.960]   How many of those do you absorb?
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.420]   130.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.940]   You eat 160, you absorb 130, where'd the other 30 go?
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.520]   - In the processing of that food energy?
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.360]   - No.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.880]   Turned out, the fiber in those almonds,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.820]   both soluble and insoluble fiber,
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.540]   and by the way, fiber's sort of the key
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.040]   to the kingdom in this story,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.960]   forms a gel on the inside of your intestine.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.880]   The insoluble fiber, the cellulose, forms a fishnet,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.240]   if you will, a latticework on the inside of your duodenum.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.960]   The soluble fiber, which are globular,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.560]   plug the holes in that fishnet.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.440]   Together, they form a secondary barrier.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.400]   You can actually see it on electron microscopy,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.520]   a whitish gel, and that prevents absorption
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.840]   of those 30 calories.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.120]   So yes, 130 get absorbed, but many of them don't.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.680]   They end up going further down the intestine
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.920]   to the next part, called the jejunum,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.980]   and that's where the microbiome is.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.320]   Now, everyone knows about the microbiome nowadays.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.640]   It's all the bacteria.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.840]   We always say, when women are pregnant,
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.680]   you're eating for two.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.220]   Well, we're always eating for 100 trillion.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.080]   Now, they have to eat.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.980]   Well, what do they eat?
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.920]   They eat what you eat.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.360]   The question is, how much did you get
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.680]   versus how much did they get?
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.520]   Well, if you ate almonds, they're getting those 30 calories.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.480]   So even though you count the calories at your lips,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.800]   that doesn't matter.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.760]   What really matters is counting the calories
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.640]   at your intestinal brush border, okay?
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.120]   And they're not the same.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.000]   So if you feed your gut, that's a good thing
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.560]   because then your gut will take those calories
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.040]   and turn it into things like short-chain fatty acids,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.320]   which end up being protective
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.520]   against chronic metabolic disease,
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.080]   acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.400]   Those are actually good.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.600]   They're anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer's
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.240]   because you fed your microbiome.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.560]   So even though you ate 160, you absorbed 130.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.320]   So a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   because if you ate it with fiber, it wasn't for you.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.640]   It was for your bacteria,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.680]   but that's not the way you count them up.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.220]   So that's problem number one.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.340]   Problem number two, amino acids.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.020]   So we all eat protein.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.220]   Let's say you eat too much protein.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.200]   You have, you know, the porterhouse steak, all right?
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.860]   Now, if you're a bodybuilder,
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.880]   those amino acids might go to muscle
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.900]   and you might increase your muscle mass
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.880]   because you're a bodybuilder,
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.000]   because you're putting excess force on those muscles
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   and you're growing those muscles, okay?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.620]   But let's say you're not a bodybuilder.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.280]   Let's say you're a mere mortal like me.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.480]   - Or let's say you're a kid going through puberty
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.840]   who's synthesizing a lot of muscle,
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.920]   not because they're lifting weights,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.880]   because they're in growth. - But because testosterone's
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.140]   making it happen, yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.980]   But let's say you're not.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.600]   Let's say, you know, you're just, you know,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.200]   just schlump off the street like, you know, Joe Schmo, okay?
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.740]   And you eat that porterhouse.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.820]   You've taken on all these amino acids.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.580]   There's no place to store it other than muscle.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.960]   So your liver takes the excess
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.940]   and deamidates that amino acid,
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.600]   takes the amino group off
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.880]   to turn it from a amino acid into an organic acid.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.000]   And then that organic acid can then enter the Krebs cycle,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.720]   the tricarboxylic acid cycle,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.120]   what goes on in the mitochondria in order to generate ATP,
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.240]   the chemical energy that your body needs
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.760]   in order to power itself.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.600]   Okay, now that's a good thing.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.160]   It takes double the amount of energy
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.160]   to prepare that amino acid for burning,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.100]   as it does to prepare a carbohydrate for burning.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.320]   - Or fat, 'cause when I asked about,
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.000]   when you asked about almonds, why the 160 versus 130,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.080]   I thought it was the processing.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.180]   It turned out it was fiber.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.080]   You're saying for protein, let's make it realistic
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.580]   for a really nice big porterhouse steak,
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.120]   which I love, by the way.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.760]   Let's say 800 calories. - Me too.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.720]   - Well, it turns out-- - How much of that is,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.960]   so that's what goes in your mouth, my mouth.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   How much of it is actually eaten,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.980]   to stay with your calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.640]   In the processing of that,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.360]   what percentage actually goes
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.000]   into your total caloric intake?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.400]   - Right, so about 10% of everything you eat
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.860]   goes to just maintaining body temperature.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.800]   It's called the thermic effect of food.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.440]   But when you're eating protein,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.680]   you actually generate more heat.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.400]   And the reason is because it takes two ATP
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.960]   to phosphorylate that organic acid,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.120]   as opposed to one ATP
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.560]   to phosphorylate that carbohydrate for consumption.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.440]   So you actually have a net loss of energy
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.080]   because it was an amino acid versus a monosaccharide,
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.400]   a sugar.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.040]   Now, you brought up fat.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.280]   Fat doesn't need to be phosphorylated.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.160]   So it actually doesn't have any thermic effect
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.420]   of food at that point.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.240]   So it depends on what it is
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   as to whether or not you have loss.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.840]   - Okay, so in this, let's make it actually realistic.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   A 1,600 calorie porterhouse with a nice slab of--
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.680]   - Butter. [laughs]
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.800]   - Of grass-fed butter on there.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.280]   I do this every once in a while, not often.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.480]   - With some creamed spinach
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.040]   and maybe some mushrooms along the side.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.280]   - Honestly, when I'm eating a porterhouse,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   I don't want to adulterate the taste with anything else
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.880]   except maybe some butter, maybe a salad afterwards.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.800]   But let's say 1,600 calories of,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.100]   it's got some fat in there for sure.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.880]   Let's say 1,000 of those calories is protein.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.580]   The other 600 are fat.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.760]   - Something like that.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.160]   - Something like that, depending on how marbled it is.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.400]   Okay, so based on what you just said
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.560]   about the thermic effect of food and protein in particular,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.820]   of that 1,000 calories, how much actually can we count?
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.880]   I'm not a calorie counter,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.900]   but does one include as calories truly ingested?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.200]   - Well, if you ingested 1,600--
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.320]   - Well, that's what went in the mouth,
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   but what is going to go against your burn deficit?
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.280]   - Right.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.740]   So I would have to actually do the math to figure that out.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.760]   But as a guess--
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.720]   - Yeah, back of the envelope.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.280]   - Back of the envelope calculation,
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.680]   you're going to lose about 25% of that.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.480]   - Wow, so we're talking 750 calories.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.320]   - Yeah.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.900]   - And to translate this a bit,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.400]   so what we're saying here is if you're somebody
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.920]   who is trying to lose weight or maintain weight,
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.560]   or perhaps even gain weight,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.040]   you eat a 1,600 calorie porterhouse
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.020]   with a slab of butter on it,
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.120]   600 of those calories we're saying in this is fat,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.880]   with the remaining 1,000 calories,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.560]   that all went in your mouth.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.440]   - So you counted at your mouth.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.280]   - Right.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.400]   - But 700, but then when you compare it
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.920]   against your energy burn for that day,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.960]   to maintain temperature, brain activity, physical activity,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.040]   really it's only 750 calories.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.880]   - That's right.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.160]   - That's a huge difference.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.820]   - Exactly, and another reason why a calorie's not a calorie.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.240]   Now let's take the third, let's take fats.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.440]   So over here we have Omega-3s,
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.060]   heart-healthy, anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer's,
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.600]   save your life.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.560]   And over here we have trans fats, the devil incarnate,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.880]   consumable poison, because you can't break
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.040]   the trans double bond, you don't have the desaturase
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.500]   to break that trans double bond.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.660]   So it basically accumulates, lines your arteries,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.040]   lines your liver, causes chronic metabolic disease,
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.940]   causes insulin resistance.
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:55.280]   Omega-3s don't even get broken down for energy,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.760]   because they're so important, they stay intact,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.600]   because your brain needs them, your heart needs them,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.160]   whereas trans fats can't be broken down
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.300]   because of that trans double bond.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.840]   One, save your life, other one, kill you.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.400]   They're both nine calories per gram,
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.120]   if you explode them in a bomb calorimeter,
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.340]   because a calorie burned is a calorie burned,
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.320]   but a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten,
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   because one will save your life, one will kill you.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.320]   And finally, the big kahuna,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.280]   the one that blows everything else out of the water,
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.120]   fructose and glucose.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.480]   All right, now, glucose is the energy of life.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.040]   - So here we're talking carbohydrates.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.020]   I think most of our audience will be familiar
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.480]   with the so-called macronutrients.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.680]   So we talked about fat, in this case, almonds.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.920]   There's some fiber in there,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.420]   probably a little bit of carbohydrate.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.580]   - Little bit. - Little bit.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.200]   Talked about the porterhouse with butter.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.060]   - Right. - You can be hungry already.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.280]   That's protein and fat, very little, if any, carbohydrate.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   It should be zero, essentially, maybe one.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.640]   - Zero, zero. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.680]   And then now we're talking about carbohydrates,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.440]   and we're gonna subdivide that into glucose and fructose.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.560]   - Right, galactose basically becomes glucose in the liver,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.720]   so we can dispense with that,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.060]   unless you have a disease called galactosemia,
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   which is about 120,000, and causes neonatal meningitis,
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.300]   and it's a disease, as a pediatric endocrinologist,
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.140]   I would take care of,
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.880]   but we can dispense with that for the moment.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.680]   All right, so glucose, fructose.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.840]   Glucose is the energy of life.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.280]   Every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.680]   Glucose is so damn important
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.220]   that if you don't consume it, your body makes it.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.080]   So it will take an amino acid and turn it into glucose.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.760]   - That's gluconeogenesis. - Gluconeogenesis, that's right.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.280]   It will take a fatty acid and turn it into glucose,
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.640]   and specifically the glycerol portion of the triglyceride
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.720]   will turn into glucose.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.040]   So the Inuit, they didn't have any place
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.520]   to grow carbohydrate.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.760]   They had ice, they had whale blubber.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.060]   They still have serum glucose level,
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.840]   and the reason is because you had to.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.720]   You have to have a serum glucose level
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.680]   in order to power your brain, in order to power your heart.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.180]   Yes, you can use ketones, of course you can,
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.760]   but only if you're in a ketogenic state
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.840]   will you use exclusively ketones,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.480]   and you also need glucose for structural changes
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.180]   in specific proteins and particularly hormones.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.180]   So glucose molecules will stud TSH, LH, FSH,
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.140]   different pituitary hormones
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.720]   in order to increase their potency.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.600]   It's one of the reasons why aging
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.360]   leads to defective hormoneogenesis.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.020]   For instance, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.480]   is the loss of glycosylation
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.320]   on individual peptide hormones
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.200]   because of the inability to add glucose.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.860]   - Because of insulin?
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.260]   - No, no, it's an aging phenomenon.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.200]   - Okay, we'll come back to this
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.860]   'cause I think it's really important.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.960]   The idea that ingestion of carbohydrates
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.580]   and the, as you called it,
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.680]   the studying of carbohydrate molecules on hormones
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.920]   can augment the function of those hormones,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.580]   and with aging that's a less efficient process.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.640]   - It's a less efficient process,
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.480]   but it's not because of consumption.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.680]   - Right, people are still, I see the plenty of folks
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.860]   who are 65 and older eating plenty of carbohydrates.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.020]   You're saying a lot of them have deficient thyroid,
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.720]   testosterone, estrogen, prolactin, et cetera,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.860]   because of the way those carbohydrates
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.120]   are not studying the hormones.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.640]   - Exactly, so all of those are glycoprotein hormones.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   - Let's tee that up for later
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.760]   'cause I think that's an interesting avenue to go down.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.040]   - Okay, and there's a disease in children and babies
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.500]   called congenital disorders of glycosylation,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   where you can't put glucose molecules on specific proteins,
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.380]   and it causes severe mental retardation,
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.200]   all sorts of metabolic havoc,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.240]   and a lot of those babies die for that matter.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.980]   So that's an important thing.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.460]   All right, but that's how important glucose is.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.440]   Fructose, on the other hand, this sweet molecule,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.020]   the molecule we seek, the reason why the food industry
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.520]   studs every food in the grocery store,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.280]   and 73% of all items in the American grocery store
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.620]   have added sugar on purpose for the food industry's purposes,
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.200]   not for yours, because fructose is addictive,
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.040]   activates the nucleus accumbens,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.720]   the reward center of the brain,
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.540]   in the same way that cocaine, heroin, nicotine, alcohol do,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.440]   and drives dopamine receptors down,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.840]   just like nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, heroin do.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:56.480]   That molecule, fructose, is number one,
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.520]   completely vestigial to all vertebrate life.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.200]   There is no biochemical reaction in any vertebrate
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.720]   that requires dietary fructose.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.600]   That's number one.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.420]   Number two--
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.200]   - Okay, sorry, I'm gonna just answer.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.000]   So you're saying that even though we can process fructose--
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.120]   - We have a limited capacity to process it,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.720]   in the same way we have a limited capacity
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.000]   to metabolize alcohol.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.920]   Now, if you have one drink a day, you're okay.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.240]   If you have two drinks a day, depends on how big you are.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.200]   You know, you and I can probably--
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   - I would argue two drinks a week is the maximum,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.120]   but let's not go there.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   But in terms of, you're saying, when you say fructose,
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.400]   processing of fructose is vestigial,
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.920]   what you're saying is that we don't need to do it.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.880]   It's like the appendix.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.680]   It's an organ for which it has no function.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.520]   - Exactly.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.960]   And fructose has no function in the human body, period.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.800]   - You don't need it.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   - You don't need it.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.180]   Don't need it.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.100]   But our diet is replete with it.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.360]   In fact, our fructose consumption's gone up 25-fold
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.280]   since the beginning of the last century.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.060]   - I have to ask this now.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.720]   I love fruit, I eat berries galore,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.040]   especially since the price of berries
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.280]   seems to have come down.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.240]   It used to be the only get 'em certain times a year.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.880]   I'm what you call a drive-by blueberry eater.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.000]   So I'll just walk past and just take a fistful.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.560]   You can't put them in front of me without me eating them.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.720]   This is even difficult for me
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.360]   when other people I don't know are eating them.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.360]   So I eat lots of blueberries, strawberries,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.020]   blackberries if they're in season, I love them.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:33.860]   - No problem.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.800]   - Loaded with fructose?
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.720]   - No.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.640]   - Plenty of fiber, low fructose?
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.480]   - Low fructose.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.840]   And berries, berries are the lowest fructose
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.680]   of all the different fruits.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.220]   - I was so worried about asking you this today.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.060]   - Not a bit.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.020]   - Okay.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.020]   - And fruit is okay because of the fiber.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.300]   So the molecule, the fructose molecule's the same
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   whether it's in a berry or in a banana
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.420]   or for that matter in a Coca-Cola.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.020]   The fructose molecule is the same molecule.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.800]   The difference is that in the berry
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.720]   it comes with a whole lot of fiber.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.280]   In the banana it comes with a whole lot less fiber.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.360]   And in the Coca-Cola, it doesn't come with any fiber.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.840]   And the fiber is what mitigates the absorption.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.740]   So when you consume the fructose with fiber,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.800]   so your blueberries, you're feeding your microbiome.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.360]   That fructose wasn't for you.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.200]   - Got it.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.040]   Such a relief.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.080]   And I must say recently I had a whole body MRI
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.240]   as a preemptive thing.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.480]   - How was that?
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.380]   - It was great.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.060]   I got to watch a Netflix in there
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.780]   and I never had a whole body MRI.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.940]   I learned a few things that were useful to me.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.100]   I've got a clean bill of health, so that's great.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.940]   - Well, that's good.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.300]   - But one of the pieces of feedback I got is
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   that my gut was filled with this very high contrast stuff.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.360]   And they asked, do you consume a lot of blueberries?
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.760]   And I said, indeed I do, why?
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.200]   And they said, because that high contrast of it
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.640]   shows up white on the scan is high concentrations
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.760]   of magnesium that we see in people
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.840]   that ingest large amounts of blueberries,
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.240]   which is pretty rare.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.560]   And yours are comparable to a bear in blueberry season.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.520]   - Wow.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.780]   - And basically my entire gut was filled with blueberries.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.320]   I suppose I need to cut back a little bit.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.900]   But now I know that fruit is okay,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.480]   especially if the fruit has a lot of fiber,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.860]   but fructose itself,
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.000]   especially if it's not partnered with fiber,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.120]   is first of all, not required for survival at all.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.800]   But you're telling me is problematic.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   - Yeah, and let me tell you why it's problematic.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.000]   We haven't gotten to that yet.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.480]   We're just talking about whether
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.960]   it's vestigial versus needed.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.240]   Now let's talk about what fructose does.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.160]   Turns out fructose inhibits three, count 'em,
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.320]   three separate enzymes necessary
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   for normal mitochondrial function.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.480]   Now, your mitochondria make ATP.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.200]   Your mitochondria have to work at peak efficiency.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   That's what metabolic health is.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.700]   Is mitochondria working at peak efficiency?
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.540]   Well, there are three enzymes
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.840]   that are inhibited by fructose.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.360]   Number one, AMP kinase, all right?
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.620]   Now, AMP kinase is the fuel gauge on the liver cell.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.440]   It's the thing that tells the liver
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.240]   to make more mitochondria, fresher mitochondria,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.260]   because if your AMP levels are high,
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.440]   that means you've dephosphorylated a bunch of ATPs
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.760]   and you have to regenerate 'em,
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.200]   so you need some more mitochondria,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.240]   so it's a negative feedback pathway.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.920]   Well, you need that AMP kinase
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.760]   to generate that mitochondrial biogenesis signal,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.560]   except that fructose, a metabolite of fructose
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.040]   called methylglyoxal, MGO, sits in the active site
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.720]   of the gamma subunit of that AMP kinase
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.860]   and actually binds to arginines in that active site,
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.860]   rendering that enzyme now dead.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.400]   It's an irreversible inhibition
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.760]   because of the covalent bonding of that methylglyoxal,
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.720]   that aldehyde, to the arginine,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.920]   and now that enzyme is dead.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.940]   Okay, so it basically acts like a key
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.080]   that doesn't turn the lock,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.560]   but prevents the key that you want in that lock
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.040]   from entering the lock.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.520]   It's like gluing a lock shut, yeah.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.400]   Got it, so that's one of the enzymes.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.440]   That's one.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   Second one, ACAD-L, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.080]   So this is necessary to cleave two carbon fragments
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.760]   off fatty acids to prepare them for metabolism.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.520]   So it inhibits that one.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.920]   And then finally, it inhibits
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.680]   carnitine palmitoyl transferase one, now CPT-1.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.720]   Now that's the enzyme that regenerates carnitine.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.360]   Carnitine is the shuttle mechanism
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   by which you get the fatty acids from the outer
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.720]   mitochondrial membrane through
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.560]   to the inner mitochondrial membrane
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.960]   so that they can be beta-oxidized for energy.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.240]   So if you don't have that CPT-1,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.180]   you're basically carnitine-less,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.380]   and therefore you can't generate beta-oxidation.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.880]   You said fructose inhibits all three
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.640]   of these enzymatic pathways.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.480]   As a biologist, I have to ask you,
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.140]   how potently does it inhibit them?
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.520]   I mean, 'cause there are drugs that block receptors,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.560]   and then there are drugs that block receptors
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.780]   with unbelievable affinity.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.360]   So I mean, mechanistically in a dish, meaning in vitro,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.080]   you can see all sorts of things.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.320]   But how significant is this for obesity,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.120]   for mitochondrial function in vivo in us?
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.740]   - All right, so the dose determines the poison, right?
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.840]   Paracelsus 1537.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.280]   There are toxins that are parts per billion
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.960]   and will kill you, like sarin, ricin, cyanide.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.780]   By the way, cyanide's a good analogy
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.860]   because it's working on mitochondria.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.560]   It's basically causing mitochondria
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.920]   to be completely defective, all right?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.760]   Then there are intermediate toxins,
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.420]   like arsenic and carbon tetrachloride.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.580]   Parts per million, and they take a little longer to work.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.240]   They're not gonna kill you on the spot.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.080]   That's why I can eat an apple seed
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.740]   that has a little bit of arsenic in it,
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.640]   but I'm not gonna die.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   - Right, and then finally there,
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.120]   and by the tobacco smoke goes in there.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.840]   And then finally, you have weak toxins, all right?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.100]   And you know, where it's not one exposure
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.940]   that will kill you.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.160]   It's, you know, 10,000 exposures that'll kill you,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.120]   like alcohol.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.480]   - Or toxic people.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.780]   - Yeah, or toxic people.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.680]   Well, it depends on how toxic. - Sometimes it only takes one.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.520]   Couldn't resist, sorry.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   Sometimes it only, mildly toxic people.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.080]   Anyway, the point is that fructose is in that last category.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.760]   So it's not what you do one day that kills you.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.240]   It's what you do every day that kills you.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.200]   And if you basically eat ultra-processed food,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.720]   high in sugar, for 10 years in a row,
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.040]   it's gonna show up in terms of your comorbidities.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.360]   And ultimately, yeah, it will kill you.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   And we have the data to show how many years you will lose.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.000]   So right now in America, we pay an eight-year longevity tax.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.520]   If you look at Japan, they have a mean age of death of 88.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.080]   We have a mean age of 80, okay?
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.320]   We're paying an eight-year longevity tax just by living here.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.860]   And we're talking about the healthy people.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.180]   Now, if you have metabolic syndrome,
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.400]   it's a 15-year longevity tax.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.360]   And, sorry, if you have obesity,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.620]   it's a 15-year longevity tax.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.720]   And if you have metabolic syndrome,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.700]   it's a 20-year longevity tax.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.900]   That is primarily, not completely, but primarily sugar.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.040]   It's also, you know, Omega-6s, it's also trans fats,
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.000]   you know, left over because now they're gone.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.580]   But, you know, people are still suffering the ravages
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.560]   of the trans fats, you know, from the previous generation.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   - Are they gone?
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.580]   I mean, I do remember as a kid
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.800]   when we had margarine in our refrigerator.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.720]   This is actually a big debate in my home.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.040]   One parent, I won't identify which, was pro-margarine.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.420]   The other was pro-butter, anti-margarine.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.520]   The marriage didn't last, but there were other reasons.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.840]   - That's probably why.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.900]   - I went butter.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.760]   - Butter is fine.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.880]   In fact, time declared, you know, front cover,
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.160]   butter's back, you know.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.840]   Margarine was the bad guy, without question.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.460]   And we know now, but, you know,
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.040]   back when we thought it was a calorie, it was a calorie.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.840]   We thought, oh, margarine, you know,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.460]   it's the same, you know, nine calories per gram.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.600]   And we said, it lowers your triglycerides.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.540]   Bad idea.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:00.260]   It was, because what it did was, it lined your liver.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.900]   Because you couldn't break that trans double bond.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.100]   And, you know, so they're now gone from our food supply.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.300]   - They're illegal.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.660]   - They're illegal, they're banned.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.020]   But you can make trans fats in your own kitchen
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.120]   by taking olive oil and heating it
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.020]   to beyond the smoking point.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.100]   So they're not completely gone.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.860]   They're just gone from ultra-processed food.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.100]   So now sugar's the big problem,
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.460]   because of these three enzymes that you are inhibiting.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.700]   The point is, we started this with a calorie's a calorie.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.340]   Well, if you are inhibiting mitochondrial function,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.260]   then a calorie's not a calorie, is it?
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.380]   - You're reducing the intensity of the furnace.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.340]   So this whole calorie's a calorie just makes no sense.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.500]   And it hasn't worked at any level.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.660]   And there is no study that actually shows
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.980]   that cutting calories makes a difference.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.780]   And I can show you, you know, voluminous data
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.580]   that shows that virtually every weight loss study
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.400]   that led to caloric restriction basically didn't work.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.380]   Not for any length of time.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.300]   Just to round out our earlier discussion,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.540]   'cause I find it fascinating
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.560]   and I know other people will as well,
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.280]   talked about that 160 calories,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.940]   that's actually 130 at the business end of things,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.020]   of almonds.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.380]   We talked about the porterhouse steak with butter
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:24.380]   and the 25% reduction in what's actually "eaten".
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.140]   And I'll get back to this 'cause this "issue",
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.820]   I think the problem is there's a lack of useful language
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.740]   to dissociate this stuff.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.540]   Even just calling fat, fat.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.740]   People think it's gonna make you gain body fat.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.580]   - Totally.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.580]   - If we called it adipose tissue and lipids,
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.080]   we would have avoided this confusion.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   So I don't wanna get there just yet,
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.460]   but I wanna make sure with-
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.580]   - The food industry does this on purpose.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.420]   - Really?
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.260]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.500]   So they tell you a sugar is a sugar, which is not true.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.540]   They tell you a calorie is a calorie, which is not true.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.900]   And they tell you a fat is a fat, which is not true.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.380]   Okay, this is very specifically.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.940]   So when you're talking about sugar,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.020]   you're talking about dietary sugar,
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.600]   or are you talking about blood sugar?
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.540]   'Cause blood sugar is blood glucose.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.860]   - Or cholesterol. - And I never use-
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.260]   - Dietary cholesterol, or circulating cholesterol, or-
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.820]   - Absolutely, okay.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:19.180]   So we've done this to ourselves,
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.840]   but the food industry has really promulgated it
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.240]   because we farmed out nutrition policy and information
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.260]   to the food industry.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.100]   So they actually use this for their purposes.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.540]   It's one of the problems in this field.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.100]   As we all know, quality nutrition influences,
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.260]   of course, our physical health,
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.980]   but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.900]   our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.080]   And we know that one of the most important features
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.020]   of high quality nutrition is making sure
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.020]   that we get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.780]   from high quality unprocessed
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.620]   or minimally processed sources,
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.740]   as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.800]   to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.660]   including the gut microbiome.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.780]   Now, I, like most everybody,
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.840]   try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.580]   ideally mostly from minimally processed
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.020]   or non-processed foods.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.140]   However, one of the challenges
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.980]   that I and so many other people face
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.060]   is getting enough servings of high quality fruits
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.020]   and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.220]   that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.240]   That's why way back in 2012,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.060]   long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.700]   And so I'm delighted that AG1
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.860]   is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.580]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.860]   and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.660]   is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.620]   that is it provides insurance
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.400]   that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.080]   probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health,
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.260]   physical health, and performance.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.660]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.940]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.500]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.260]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.100]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.420]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.460]   to claim that special offer.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.860]   For the third category of macronutrients, carbohydrates,
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.100]   you differentiated glucose and fructose.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:16.980]   If I ingest, let's say, a half a bagel
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.220]   since we were talking about New York, your city of origin,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.360]   they have great bagels on the West Coast.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.200]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.020]   - Yeah, it's not the same.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:24.860]   - It's pretty pitiful.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.900]   - Same with the pizza dough.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   It's like they claim it's the water, whatever it is,
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.660]   it's different back there and it's better.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.860]   - Indeed.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.860]   - Half a bagel, let's say 250 calories, mostly carbohydrate.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:41.500]   This is an unlined, no cream cheese, no schmear,
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   as they call it back there.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.260]   No cream cheese, no butter, none of that thing.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.380]   Just half a bagel, 250 calories.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.540]   So that's what I ate.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.700]   You're saying that a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.980]   How much of that carbohydrate,
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.300]   given that it's probably most,
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.860]   let's assume it's mostly glucose.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.680]   Let's do it this way.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.520]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.340]   It's polymerized glucose.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.840]   - Okay, polymerized glucose. - That's what it is.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.740]   - How much of that is actually utilized or burned
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.700]   versus the original 250?
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.360]   - So if you look at what happens to energy in the body,
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.480]   65% of that which is ingested
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.460]   goes to resting energy expenditure, just to power the body.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.300]   10% goes to the thermic effect of food.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.060]   And then 25% goes to activity.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.540]   That's the breakdown of where the energy goes.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.500]   - And that's calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrate.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.200]   - Yeah, from everything together.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.500]   And glucose is a perfectly good example of how that works.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.420]   The point is though that when you ingest glucose,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.220]   you're getting a big glucose excursion in your bloodstream.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.940]   So you're getting a big glucose spike.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.480]   And that glucose spike has to come down.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.460]   Well, what makes it come down?
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.080]   The hormone insulin.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.020]   Insulin is the bad guy in this story.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.060]   The higher your glucose goes,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.060]   the more your pancreas will release insulin
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.960]   in order to bring that glucose down.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.720]   Well, it turns out that glucose rise was not benign.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.600]   That glucose rise led to endothelial dysfunction.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.180]   Transient, but nonetheless, endothelial dysfunction.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.720]   - Could you just remind people
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.980]   what endothelial cells are?
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.820]   - The inside of your arteries, okay?
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.660]   And it will change blood pressure.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.660]   We've got plenty of data to demonstrate
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.860]   how it changes blood pressure.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.140]   And over time, that will cause coronary artery disease.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.220]   That will cause kidney disease, et cetera.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.340]   But it's the insulin response that is really the bad guy.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.620]   Now, people think insulin is good
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.900]   because it lowers blood glucose.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.300]   After all, diabetics take insulin
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.060]   to lower their blood glucose.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.220]   Okay, let's take a diabetic.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.140]   A patient with diabetes.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.740]   Blood sugar's 300, that's bad.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.660]   We give him a shot of insulin in the arm.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.820]   Blood sugar goes down to 100.
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.260]   Blood sugar went from 300 to 100.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.140]   Okay, where did the 200 points of blood glucose go?
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:12.580]   - I'm assuming that the insulin sequestered it to where?
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.880]   - I'm assuming to the liver.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.660]   - To the fat.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.580]   - Interesting. - For storage.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.860]   That's insulin's job.
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.380]   Insulin takes whatever you're not burning
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.460]   and puts it into fat for storage.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.540]   Insulin is not the diabetes hormone.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.220]   Insulin is the energy storage hormone.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.780]   - How quickly does it do that?
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:29.620]   - Pretty quick.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.220]   - Because if I'm having a very busy day,
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.460]   or the diabetic person is having a very busy day
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.220]   and they're moving around a lot,
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.580]   then you've got insulin-bound glucose in the bloodstream
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.420]   for how long?
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.500]   - No, no, insulin doesn't bind glucose.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.260]   Insulin binds to its receptor.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.100]   - Sure, sorry.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.980]   - Insulin allows for glucose transporters to work.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.900]   - So, but for some period of time,
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.360]   while that person is active,
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.940]   there's an opportunity to utilize that glucose, right?
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.700]   So how quickly is insulin managing that glucose?
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.140]   We know that the spike comes down quickly,
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.660]   but the glucose is not available for energy utilization
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.740]   after what?
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   It's sequestered to the adipose, to the fat tissue
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.500]   within an hour?
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.340]   Is that about right?
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.820]   - So about 90 minutes, yeah.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.420]   But I mean, if you're active,
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:23.420]   if you eat a muffin and you're active,
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.140]   your muscles are going to take up that glucose
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.980]   irrespective of insulin.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.320]   In fact, muscles are insulin independent.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.020]   They have glucose transporters,
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.260]   but they are insulin independent
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.380]   because if they weren't,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.460]   then every patient in diabetic ketoacidosis
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.140]   would be paralyzed, okay?
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.620]   So glucose will end up in muscles
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:48.500]   irrespective of energy status and insulin status.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.820]   - And in muscles, it's used as immediate fuel
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.420]   and glycogen?
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.480]   - Both. - Okay.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.500]   - Immediate fuel and glycogen storage in the muscle.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.620]   Absolutely, all right?
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.380]   Now, if you're active,
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.660]   then you will clear glucose into muscle,
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.820]   therefore your blood glucose won't rise as much
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.060]   'cause it went into muscle,
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.300]   and therefore your pancreas will put out less insulin
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.180]   because it doesn't have to clear as much
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.780]   from the bloodstream, and that's okay, that's good, right?
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.620]   But let's say you didn't exercise,
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.420]   so you've got a big glucose excursion,
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.920]   now you have a big insulin response,
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.300]   and that insulin is going to take the excess
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.220]   that's in your blood, it has to clear it,
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.380]   and it will go to fat for storage.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.720]   That insulin rise turns out to be particularly egregious
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.280]   in terms of metabolic disease, and I can prove it.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.780]   There is a mouse, my favorite mouse.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.820]   I love this mouse.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.260]   This mouse turns medicine on its head
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.940]   and teaches every doctor why they have to go
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.320]   back to medical school and learn it right.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:58.200]   This mouse is called the PADERCO mouse, P-O-D-I-R-K-O.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.780]   - Is it discovered by PADERCO?
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.060]   - No. (laughs)
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.500]   No, it was discovered in Ron Kahn's lab,
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.580]   it was manufactured in Ron Kahn's lab.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.460]   So this is a tissue-specific insulin receptor
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.700]   knockout mouse, I-R-K-O.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.260]   - So it lacks the insulin receptor in the kidney.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.300]   - PADERCO, glomerular podocyte
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.380]   insulin receptor knockout mouse.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.460]   - We haven't talked too much about transgenic models
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.560]   and knock-ins and knock-outs,
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.020]   so just in 10 seconds or less, basically,
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.980]   these are mice that are genetically engineered
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.220]   to lack the receptor for insulin,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.660]   specifically in the kidney.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.980]   - Glomerular podocyte, the kidney.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.020]   - In the kidney, and everywhere else in this mouse,
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.420]   insulin does its thing normally.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.740]   - Exactly, great.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:47.740]   So these animals are euglycemic, normal blood glucose levels.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.820]   These animals are normally glucose-tolerant,
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.320]   so they go up, they go down, just like every other mouse.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.660]   These mice are not fat, these mice are not thin.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:05.620]   These mice are mice, except they have
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.740]   the worst diabetic nephropathy on the planet.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.460]   - So their, oh, their kidney is degenerative.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.020]   - Their kidneys degenerate to nothing.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.860]   - Yikes.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.180]   - Now, they have normal blood glucose levels.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.020]   They have normal glucose tolerance.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.480]   They have normal insulin tolerance whole body,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.080]   but their kidneys are dying.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.420]   How come?
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.460]   Can't be the glucose, it's the insulin,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.580]   because insulin's the bad guy.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.020]   Insulin's actually making the kidney disease.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.220]   And so these animals that are insulin-resistant,
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.780]   they have diabetic nephropathy without diabetes.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:50.020]   - So the insulin is having a negative,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.080]   clearly negative effect on the kidneys
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.140]   without binding to the receptor.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:54.980]   - Exactly.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.060]   - So circulating insulin can do stuff
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.980]   without binding to its receptor.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.180]   - Well, no, it binds to its receptor
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.580]   in different parts of the body.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.540]   - Other parts of the body, but in the kidney it can't
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.380]   'cause it's a knockout.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.780]   - It's a knockout, right.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.620]   The point is insulin does stuff by itself.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:14.540]   And it turns out insulin drives growth.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.300]   Now, every cell in your body wants to burn
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:25.220]   at one time in its life and wants to grow
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.980]   at another time in its life.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.420]   Every cell has those two pathways.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.860]   Burning, growth, burning, growth.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:37.620]   What determines whether a cell should be burning
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.420]   or whether a cell should be growing?
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.260]   - I don't know what makes it burning,
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.660]   but presumably it has something to do with mitochondria.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.900]   - It has everything to do with mitochondria.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.020]   So every cell needs to burn and needs to grow
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.780]   at a different time in its life.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.640]   Here's a way to think about it.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.900]   We all start out as a zygote, a single cell.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.420]   We end up an adult.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   Now, that single cell had to become two cells.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.500]   Those two cells had to become four cells.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.180]   Those four cells had to become eight cells.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.980]   And on and on and on and on.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.420]   So every cycle there's a doubling.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:22.380]   How many doublings to get from a zygote to an adult?
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.260]   - What's an exponential growth?
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.540]   So I don't know it off the top of my head.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.380]   - 41.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:34.380]   - 41, two to the 41 doublings.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.220]   - Gives you an organism?
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.220]   - 10 trillion cells.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.060]   - We're 10 trillion cells?
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.900]   - We're 10 trillion cells.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:39.740]   - Do we know that?
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.860]   - Yeah.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.180]   - Okay.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.300]   - Two to the 41.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.140]   - Okay.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.980]   - Okay, now of those 41 doublings,
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.260]   some of them had to occur in utero.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.340]   Some of them had to occur postnatally.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.700]   So I need two numbers that add up to 41.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.780]   How many in utero?
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.020]   How many postnatally?
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.860]   - Postnatally.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.820]   - Well, way more.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.460]   You start off with a lot more than you end up with,
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.740]   but then you have cells that turn over
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.660]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.780]   So this is a tough one.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.620]   - Okay.
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.460]   - Because skin cells turn over.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.580]   - Sure.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.060]   - With neurons, it's pretty straightforward
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.580]   because you're gonna...
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.260]   - What you get is what you get.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.500]   - Right, and you're born with somewhere between three
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.860]   and 10 X of what you end up with,
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.060]   depending on the brain structure.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:24.900]   - Yeah.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.020]   - So, but for whole body wide,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.500]   I don't know how you'd come up with that number.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.660]   - 36 and five.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.580]   - Okay.
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.780]   - 36 doublings prenatally, five doublings postnatally.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.500]   And I can prove that to you too.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.580]   Typical baby weighs seven pounds.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.980]   First doubling, 14 pounds.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.380]   Second doubling, 28 pounds.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.140]   Next doubling, 56 pounds.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.820]   Next doubling, 112 pounds.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.740]   Next doubling, 224 pounds.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.580]   - Hopefully it stops there.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.420]   - Obese individuals.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.100]   - Hopefully it stops there.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.820]   Not all people 212 pounds are obese,
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.900]   but some people who are certain heights or below
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.940]   are 212 or obese.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.940]   Point is, the cell has to know when to grow
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.740]   and when to burn.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.860]   It turns out that the signal for that is oxygen
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.460]   because oxygen is necessary for mitochondria
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.020]   to be able to burn.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:22.020]   In the absence of oxygen, the cell only knows how to grow.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.420]   This is actually why Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.620]   in 1931 for the Warburg effect.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.020]   He asked the question,
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.500]   how come cancer cells don't need oxygen to grow?
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.060]   And the answer is because no cell needs oxygen to grow.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.820]   In fact, oxygen is the thing that prevents growth.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.020]   Famous article from the New England Journal of Medicine,
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.580]   1951, Mount Everest in utero,
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:53.580]   because every fetus is oxygen deprived.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:58.580]   So normal, partial pressure of oxygen, 100 millimeters
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   of mercury out here, right?
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.300]   If I checked your blood, it'd be about 100, right?
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.260]   - I hope so.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.100]   - How about a tumor cell?
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:11.300]   - Guess tumor cells probably, is it double?
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.960]   - About 44.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.800]   - Wait, you just told me--
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.820]   - Partial pressure of oxygen in a tumor cell, it's about 44.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.580]   - But you just told me that tumor cells,
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.780]   which grow like wild.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.220]   - Right, they grow like wild
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.120]   because they don't have oxygen.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.260]   - But there are some of the,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.060]   so here's what's peculiar about it.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.100]   Tumor cells are some of the most vascularized cells,
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.460]   or tumors are heavily vascularized.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.780]   I mean, one way to try and kill one
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.860]   is to de-vascularize the tumor cell.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.940]   - Yes, and angiogenesis inhibition, et cetera,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.380]   is a big deal.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.980]   Judah Folkman and all that from Harvard, you know.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.920]   - So the excess blood to a tumor
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.320]   is the attempt to bring in oxygen that it's not getting.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.160]   - That's right.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.560]   - As opposed to delivering lots of oxygen
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.520]   and that's why it's growing.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.360]   - That's right.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.500]   - Okay.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.200]   - But a fetus, what's the partial pressure in the placenta?
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.040]   - I don't know.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:04.880]   - Six to 31.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.540]   So it's actually like a mile above Mount Everest.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.260]   That's how much oxygen the fetus gets.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.400]   And it's for that reason that you've got 36 doublings.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.740]   And then, as soon as you're out,
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.900]   you cut the cord and you start breathing
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.140]   and now your partial pressure's at 100,
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.140]   that's when growth slows down.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.740]   - Has there been any effort to treat tumors
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.220]   by oxygenating tumors?
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.060]   - Yes.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:30.900]   - And what does that look like?
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.960]   - It's hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.800]   It's a thing.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.640]   - Oh yeah. - Yeah.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.180]   - Yeah, we'll probably do an episode on hyperbaric chambers.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:41.780]   The reason we haven't yet is it's pretty niche,
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.760]   but there are people who own these things,
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.120]   who sit in these things.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.700]   Okay, so we got here by way of the bagel.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.540]   - Right.
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.300]   - So I just want to orient us.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.460]   You just had 250 calories of the bagel.
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.780]   We talked about glucose excursions.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.860]   - But it's that insulin rise that's driving the adiposity
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.140]   and it's also driving the growth, okay?
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.060]   In the absence of oxygen.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.260]   'Cause if you have oxygen,
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.100]   then you don't need that much insulin.
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.120]   - Okay.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:19.160]   So, because you're gonna burn instead of store.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.000]   Got it.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   In terms of the raw metabolism of carbohydrate though,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.480]   that glucose, if I eat 250 calories of glucose,
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.960]   how much of that did I quote unquote actually eat?
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.880]   How much is used?
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.760]   - How much is used?
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.520]   - Yeah, let's assume that I'm at my desk working
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.920]   or I'm walking around a little bit.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.180]   I'm not exercising hard in the subsequent hour.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.420]   - So used for what is the question?
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.800]   - I'm getting back to the calories.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.140]   Is the calorie a calorie?
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.440]   Clearly the answer is no.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.640]   But based on the processing of different types of calories,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.840]   we established it for fat.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.000]   The almonds, we established it for protein.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.060]   The porterhouse with butter.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.220]   And now we're trying to establish that
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.180]   for the 250 calories of bagel, which is glucose.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.020]   - Right.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.700]   So the glucose has to be phosphorylated.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.480]   So you're gonna lose an ATP in the process.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.360]   So ATP goes to ADP.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.280]   And then that ADP will go to AMP, adenosine monophosphate,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.840]   which will then go to IMP, adenosine monophosphate,
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   which will then go to uric acid.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.680]   - Okay.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.640]   - And that uric acid will be then released from the cell,
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.720]   circulate in the bloodstream,
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.580]   and hopefully go out in the kidney.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.700]   In the process, that uric acid
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.320]   can inhibit mitochondrial function,
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.360]   and it can also inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase,
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.600]   which is the enzyme in your vasculature
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.960]   that is your endogenous blood pressure lower.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.200]   - Right, by expanding blood vessels and capillaries.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.040]   - Exactly.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.740]   - Right, this is the mechanistic foundation
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.200]   of the drugs that were originally used
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.480]   for improving prostate function,
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.360]   but are used to treat erectile dysfunction,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.120]   which are the PDE inhibitors,
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.680]   which allow nitric oxide to be around longer
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.940]   and more of it, right?
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.920]   People use it for other purposes too.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.640]   Now no one will forget, if I queue it up with that example.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.840]   - We, in the neonatal intensive care unit,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   it closes patent ductus arteriosus,
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.320]   which is a big deal in the neonatal world.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.940]   - Well, okay, I wanna ask you about that,
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.040]   but so I heard two things.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.240]   One is that glucose and the insulin that goes with it
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.180]   increases uric acid.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:32.800]   Uric acid, while it has certain important functions
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.680]   in health, too much of it, you said,
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.720]   can inhibit nitric oxide.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.880]   - Yeah, can inhibit nitric oxide.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.520]   - So that means that the blood vessels and capillaries
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.740]   are gonna stay more constricted,
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.400]   so blood pressure is gonna be higher
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.240]   than it would be normally.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.080]   - That's right.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.480]   - And then uric acid is also inhibiting
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.760]   mitochondrial function.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.600]   - That's right.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.240]   - Okay.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.920]   But eating half a bagel isn't necessarily a terrible thing
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.720]   if it's within your caloric requirements.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   - And it all depends on how much you clear
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.900]   and how high your insulin goes.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.280]   - Now let's compare that 250 calories of glucose
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.320]   to 250 calories of fructose.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.720]   - Right.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.360]   - Let's come up with a food example.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:18.440]   250 calories of fructose would be trivial to consume
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.360]   in the form of high fructose corn syrup, right?
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.220]   - So remember that high fructose corn syrup
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.800]   is half glucose, half fructose.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.640]   - Okay, so let's not use--
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.020]   - So it'd be 125, 125.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:26.920]   - So let's not use that.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.080]   Well, so let's assume, so we can talk about a soda
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.540]   to get that 250 calories easily,
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.200]   especially if it's not a can or a European-sized bottle.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.640]   - Eight ounce can of soda.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.520]   - Okay, so eight ounce can of soda and maybe
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.520]   let's include a food item.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.360]   Let's talk like a store-bought packaged cookie,
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.120]   couple of Oreos, two Oreos.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:49.960]   - Okay.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.680]   - Probably get you to that 250 or maybe four Oreos.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.520]   - Maybe three Oreos.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.400]   - Okay, Oreo lovers everywhere celebrating.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.980]   Three, 250 calories of fructose.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.060]   What's the effect on uric acid?
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.920]   What's the effect on caloric burn?
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.520]   What's the effect on anything for that matter
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.080]   that we should be aware of?
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.720]   - All right, so first of all, the Oreo has plenty
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.680]   of fructose in it, so keep that in mind.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.520]   - Okay.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:18.560]   - Let's say you consumed 250 calories in a bagel
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.400]   'cause that's pretty much polymerized glucose
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.760]   versus say the soda.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.680]   So the bagel versus the soda, that's what you're--
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.880]   - Equivalent calories, right.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.720]   - Equivalent calories.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.160]   - Or the bagel versus let's say two Oreos
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.240]   and a little bit of, yeah, two Oreos.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:37.920]   - Okay, so number one, there's only half the glucose
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.400]   in the soda because the other half is the fructose.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.960]   So 125, 125.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.840]   So your glucose rise won't be as high.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.240]   Your glucose excursion will be lower.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.120]   This is actually one of the reasons
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   why there's this thing called glycemic index.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.960]   And glycemic index is a canard.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.160]   It's garbage.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.520]   It is complete and utter BS.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.780]   - The glycemic index.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.480]   - Absolute BS.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   Nothing is more egregious in terms of argument
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   than the glycemic index.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.260]   And this is one of the things that dieticians
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:18.880]   promote and espouse and one of the things that's gotta go.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.420]   This is an idea that must die.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.640]   - Okay, we'll get back to why the glycemic index
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.720]   has gotta die.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:30.240]   So 250 calories and actually can we make these equal
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.120]   just for sake of simplicity?
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.960]   Can we say 250 calories of glucose from the bagel
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.140]   versus 250 calories of fructose?
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.760]   How do we get 250 calories of pure fructose?
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.580]   - We don't.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.420]   - You can't.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.260]   Okay, you gotta bring the glucose with you.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.360]   - Lab fructose.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.200]   You'd have to make it crystalline fructose in the lab.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.320]   - Then let's stay with the Oreos,
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.000]   which is half glucose, half fructose.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:48.840]   - Right.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.800]   I mean, there is no fructose alone in nature.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.040]   - Even crackers, some of the ones that are salty
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.120]   are also sweet.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:54.940]   They have fructose in them.
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:55.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.880]   - High fructose corn syrup. - On purpose.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.920]   - Yeah, that's why it's impossible to eat just one.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.360]   - Indeed.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.760]   - So what's happening biochemically
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.720]   as a consequence of the fructose component specifically?
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.320]   - So the fructose will, first of all, go into the intestine.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.320]   The intestine will metabolize some of that fructose
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.800]   through what is known as intestinal de novo lipogenesis.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.520]   About 10% of that fructose will be turned into fat
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.320]   right in the intestine.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.680]   - And that's 'cause fructose, it just wants to be fat?
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.160]   - Yeah, fructose wants to be fat.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.680]   Fructose is the lipogenic substrate.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.880]   - Here, we're not talking about body fat.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.040]   We're talking about fat molecules
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.800]   that can potentially be used as energy.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.820]   - That's right, triglyceride molecules.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.940]   Okay, so 10% of that fructose will be turned
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.480]   into triglyceride right in the intestine
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.080]   and be released into the bloodstream.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:46.920]   And it is the reason
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.560]   for a postprandial triglyceride response.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.420]   - Postprandial is, and I'm including myself in this group,
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.920]   is the nerd speak for after eating lunch.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.000]   Typically it's lunch.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.820]   So that's actually one of the drivers
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.260]   of cardiovascular pathology,
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.740]   that intestinal de novo lipogenesis,
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.080]   turning that fructose into triglyceride
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.840]   right in the intestine.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.180]   Now, there's a limit to how fast
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:14.000]   and how much the intestine can do that.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.240]   The rest of the fructose will be absorbed
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.360]   into the portal vein,
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.560]   but not before some of that fructose
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.760]   will make it further down
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.560]   and it will nitrate tight junction proteins.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.520]   Now, let's talk about that. - Okay, portal vein
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.640]   of the kidney.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.840]   - Portal vein goes to the liver.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.040]   Portal vein goes from the visceral,
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.860]   from the intestine, to the liver.
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.880]   - No kidney, doesn't feed the kidney.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.200]   - No kidney, no kidney.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.360]   Intestine to liver.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.520]   But fructose nitrates tight junction proteins.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.120]   Now, let me explain that to your audience.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.340]   Your intestine is a sewer.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.520]   Definition of a sewer.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.120]   A pipe with shit in it, okay?
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.000]   That's its sewer.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.640]   Our intestines are sewers.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.120]   There's junk in the center
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.200]   and the job of the intestine
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:08.600]   is to move the junk through to the anus,
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.520]   absorbing the good stuff while you can.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.320]   The intestine is made up of cells,
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.840]   intestinal epithelial cells,
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.640]   that are bound together
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.940]   and they're bound with proteins
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.800]   that basically form a barrier.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   Those barriers are called tight junction proteins.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.000]   - Things like Claudins and things like that?
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.940]   - Zonulin is the main one.
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:31.780]   Okay, there are others,
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.400]   but zonulin is the one that goes,
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.500]   is defective in celiac disease.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.700]   - What defines a tight junction?
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:40.220]   Is it like completely impermeable or semi-permeable?
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.120]   - Completely impermeable,
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.640]   unless its function is inhibited.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   Turns out if you alter the phosphorylation status
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.320]   or the nitrate status of that tight junction,
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.940]   it will become transiently permeable, okay?
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.280]   And so fructose nitrates tight junction proteins,
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.520]   causing them to be transiently permeable,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.860]   allowing some of the junk in your intestine
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.740]   to get through into your bloodstream.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.780]   - So this is leaky gut.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.880]   - This is leaky gut.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.920]   This is what causes leaky gut.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.760]   Fructose is a driver of leaky gut.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.080]   - Got it.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.840]   - That causes inflammation at the level of the liver,
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.960]   which ultimately leads to systemic inflammation,
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   one of the reasons why high sensitivity CRP
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.320]   is high in patients who eat ultra-processed food.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.240]   - CRP is C-reactive protein,
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.520]   which is a marker of a,
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.400]   essentially an inflammatory immune response.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.240]   - Exactly.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.400]   - You don't want it too high.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.180]   - And 93% of Americans today are inflamed.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.780]   - Does that mean that 93% of Americans have leaky guts?
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.500]   - Yeah, it does, 'cause that's where it comes from.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.380]   - So in addition to limiting fructose intake,
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:01.660]   what are things that support the tight junctions
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.140]   of the intestinal pathway?
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.580]   - So there are three barriers in your intestine
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.240]   to keep the junk where it belongs, in the center,
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.840]   so that it can get pooped out your behind, all right?
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.560]   Three separate barriers.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.720]   One is a physical barrier called the mucin layer.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.960]   So it's a layer of mucus that actually sits
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.460]   on top of the intestinal epithelial cells.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:28.820]   Now, that mucin is a polysaccharide,
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.100]   and the bacteria can use that mucin layer
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.860]   for its own purposes.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.320]   It will eat your mucin layer
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.060]   if you don't feed your bacteria.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.460]   You must feed your bacteria,
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:42.720]   or your bacteria will feed on you, okay?
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.020]   So you are in concert with your microbiome.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.360]   If you deprive your microbiome of the food that it needs,
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.740]   it will use you as its food.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.100]   And that's one of the reasons why fiber is so important.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.100]   - So fiber to build up this mucin layer
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.540]   is one way to reinforce the fence
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.780]   that is the tight junctions, et cetera,
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.500]   between your intestine and the bloodstream.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.020]   This raises an interesting point about fasting.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.160]   Many people, including myself, do a pseudo intermittent
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.000]   fasting.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.120]   I eat my first meal somewhere between 11 and noon.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.960]   I'm not strict about this, the 11 versus noon thing.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.240]   And I probably eat my last bite of food
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.200]   somewhere around 8 p.m.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.320]   And occasionally it's outside that window.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.360]   I've done this for a long time.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.920]   It just feels best to me.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.120]   But other people use a shorter eating window.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.700]   One thing that I learned from a colleague at Yale
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.480]   who studies the gut microbiome that was surprising to me
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.940]   is that when you eat in that way,
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.100]   there's a long stretch of time, sometimes longer,
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.380]   for people that have a shorter eating window,
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.380]   longer fasting window, that is,
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.680]   where you're actually eating up your own intestinal lining.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.040]   So this idea that fasting is so great for us,
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.840]   on the one hand might be true.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.200]   On the other hand, you're actually consuming components
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.480]   of your, you're not feeding your gut microbiome
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.320]   and you deplete it.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.460]   But then here's where I was positively surprised.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.560]   When you do eat, provided that you eat enough fiber
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.240]   and in particular high quality fermented foods,
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.640]   low sugar fermented foods,
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.340]   it seems that the lining of the gut
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.460]   and the gut microbiome is replenished
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.600]   to a level that is greater than if you had eaten
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.880]   for longer periods of the 24 hour cycle.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.880]   Do I have that right?
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.040]   - We do, you do have it right.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.920]   And I don't know why that is true,
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.760]   but it does seem to be the case.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.920]   And fermented foods, in part because they've got
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.020]   already short chain fatty acids in them,
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.200]   seem to help. - Is that the preferred food
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.040]   of the microbiome?
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.800]   - Well, it's what the microbiome actually turns fiber into.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.680]   So it's probably helping your intestinal epithelial cells
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.340]   in the same way the microbiome turning fiber
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.200]   into short chain fatty acids helps.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.660]   So it's what we call a postbiotic.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.000]   So you have prebiotic, which is the food for the bacteria.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.560]   You have the probiotic, which is the bacteria itself.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.000]   And then you have the postbiotic,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.320]   which is what the bacteria make in order to heal you.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.160]   God, okay.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.960]   And so short chain fatty acids are postbiotics.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.940]   And there are a lot of people selling short chain fatty acids
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.320]   you know, drinks and supplements and what have you.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.640]   Whether they work or not is another story.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.660]   - If I consume fructose in the form of,
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.920]   let's say a highly processed food,
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.840]   has minimal antioxidants,
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.920]   but it's got plenty of calories typically.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.040]   And it's disrupting the tight junctions,
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.640]   making my gut leaky.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.680]   But I'm also eating fiber.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.880]   You know, I'm having a meal that includes a salad.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.600]   I'm having some probiotics.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.400]   And then I want like a couple of Reese's peanut butter cups,
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.300]   like in the dark chocolate ones in particular.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.600]   I don't do this anymore,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.400]   but I used to eat like that more often.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.720]   As time has gone on, I've become,
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   I don't like to call it stricter,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.640]   but more I tend to like healthier foods over time.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.480]   And I think you can get away with different things
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.800]   at different stages of life.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.420]   Although you work with young people,
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.280]   so we'll get to very young people.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.300]   So we'll get to this.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:03.080]   But how much damage am I doing by ingesting any fructose
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.920]   in the form of a highly processed food?
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.300]   - So I'll make it very simple, Andrew.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.220]   I am for dessert.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.860]   For dessert.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.160]   I am not for dessert for breakfast, lunch,
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.080]   snacks, and dinner.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:22.720]   So if you wanna have a couple of Reese's peanut butter cups
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.600]   as your dessert, in the same way as you might have
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:31.560]   a cognac for dessert, that's fine.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.960]   I have no problem with that.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   - The question is, are you gonna eat Reese's peanut butter
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   cups for breakfast?
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.440]   - No, I don't eat breakfast, but no.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.900]   But I do see your point.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.080]   - The National School Breakfast Program,
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.320]   which 29% of school children today consume,
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.440]   is a bowl of Froot Loops and a glass of orange juice.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.320]   That is 41 grams of sugar.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.240]   American Heart Association says that the upper limit
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.240]   for children should be 12 grams of added sugar per day.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   That's 41 grams of added sugar, and it's just breakfast.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.640]   - And that's fructose rich.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.200]   - Totally, completely.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.280]   So the question is, which dessert are we talking about?
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.840]   - Right, and can we adjust that morning meal
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.280]   to a different reality?
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.080]   'Cause I agree that there are plenty of kids eating that,
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.360]   or a muffin that might be the equivalent.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.960]   But what about the parent who says,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.740]   okay, let's come up with a healthier option
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:34.240]   that the kid still likes, like,
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.000]   I'm thinking back to my childhood,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.760]   like a Honey Nut Cheerios or something.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.160]   So not Froot Loops, which is kind of the extreme.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   - Take a look at the side of the package.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.000]   No difference.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   - Now let's say they go with some waffles that are made.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.060]   So with a pre-made mix, some milk, some butter,
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.840]   so mom or dad is making waffles.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.520]   Great, it sounds healthier, but then if you do the breakdown
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.200]   we're still ending up at very high.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.660]   Are we basically eating dessert for breakfast
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.240]   in that case too? - Are we eating Eggo waffles?
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.880]   Or are we making waffles de novo
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.920]   from scratch in your own kitchen?
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.560]   - Let's say making- - Big difference.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   Okay, because the Eggo waffles replete with sugar on purpose
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.700]   because the food industry knows when they add it,
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.880]   you buy more because it's addictive.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   And we actually have the demographic, the mechanistic,
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   the imaging, and also the economic data to demonstrate
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.920]   that sugar's addictive and the food industry knows it.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.480]   So have you ever heard of a phenomenon
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.300]   called price elasticity?
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:48.280]   Price elasticity is an economic term that is used
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   to ask the question, if the price of a given good
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.400]   goes up by 1%, that should result in reduction
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.300]   in purchase or consumption
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.120]   because price influences consumption.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.680]   How much does it influence it?
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.680]   So if something's price elastic, when the price goes up,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.240]   consumption goes down equivalently.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.080]   A food that is price elastic,
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.040]   the most price elastic food is eggs.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.520]   So when the price of eggs goes up 1%,
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.520]   consumption of eggs goes down 0.68%,
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.980]   meaning that eggs have a price elasticity of 0.32.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:37.480]   Got it? - Got it.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.320]   - Now, what's the most price inelastic food?
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:47.280]   The top three most price inelastic foods are fast food.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.400]   - Cereal? - 0.81.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.020]   - I like a good quiz.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.020]   Fast food, 0.81, soft drinks at 0.79 and juice at 0.77.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.940]   - Meaning people will pay not whatever,
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.980]   but they're willing to pay more,
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:04.740]   more readily willing to pay more.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.540]   - Because of the sugar, because it's addictive,
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.120]   because it's hedonic.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.180]   So many, many years ago, Andrew,
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.300]   you probably remember something called Keynesian economics.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.180]   And Keynesian economics was based on this concept
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.140]   of the rational actor.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:25.060]   And the rational actor can determine value,
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.020]   which is utility over cost.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.380]   And if you're a rational actor,
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.220]   you should be able to say, yeah, I'll buy that,
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.520]   but I won't buy that, right?
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.360]   Okay.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.140]   In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:44.980]   Nobel Prize winner, Daniel Kahneman,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.080]   described the irrational actor.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.020]   Now the irrational actor cannot determine value.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.140]   And the reason is because he is risk averse.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.560]   So the cost is always too great.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.660]   So the utility may be the same,
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:02.140]   but the cost goes up because that's why they have,
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.340]   you know, aversive tendencies, the irrational actor.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:10.180]   Jeffrey Sachs has described the hedonic actor,
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:13.780]   who also cannot determine value
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.440]   because it doesn't matter what it costs.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.660]   They need their fix.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:21.660]   And this is what's going on and the food industry knows it.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:27.120]   And that's why every food in the store has been spiked.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.420]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.020]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Element.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.500]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.600]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.540]   That means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.600]   of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.380]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.540]   is extremely important because every cell in your body,
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.820]   but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.900]   relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.400]   So when you're well hydrated
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.260]   and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.120]   in your system, your mental functioning
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.220]   and your physical functioning is improved.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.060]   I drink one packet of Element dissolved
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.460]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.980]   when I wake up in the morning, as well as while I exercise.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.060]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.520]   I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.500]   in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.680]   Element comes in a variety of different flavors,
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.620]   all of which I find really tasty.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.260]   I like the citrus, I like the watermelon,
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.360]   I like the raspberry.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.200]   Frankly, I can't pick just one.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.280]   It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.740]   which I find tastes best if they are put into water,
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.560]   dissolved, and then heated up.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.000]   I tend to do that in the winter months
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.600]   because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.060]   and in the summer and spring months,
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.140]   but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.140]   and the environment tends to be dry.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.300]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.540]   you can go to drink element spelled element.com/huberman
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.800]   to try a free sample pack.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.620]   Again, that's drink element.com/huberman.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.460]   - We talked about dessert for breakfast
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.100]   in the form of cereals,
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.100]   some of which are disguised or couched as healthier.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.300]   You know, I think of like honey nut Cheerios.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.900]   It seems healthier than Froot Loops.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.020]   It looks healthier like just by way of color.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.300]   It looks kind of weedy, you know, color.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.460]   So, but let, and in terms of lunch,
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:13.020]   I mean, one of the things that I love about Europe
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.780]   is that the breads are amazing.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.580]   - Yeah, that's a terrific pair.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.540]   - And I like them because they're not as sweet.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.380]   - Exactly.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.420]   - And so a sandwich from not every deli,
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.580]   but from a typical sandwich shopper
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.940]   that one makes with store-bought bread, sliced bread
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.240]   in the US has a lot of fructose.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.300]   I looked this up prior to our discussion today.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.620]   So in some ways, dessert is being woven into foods
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:39.220]   that are, that parents and or kids,
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.460]   everyone thinks are savory, we're actually eating sweets.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.300]   - Exactly right.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.380]   - But we can't, but we don't taste them as sweet
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.740]   at a conscious level necessarily, right?
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.200]   - But our taste buds do.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.040]   - Right.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.860]   - That's exactly right.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.220]   So the question is why do they do that?
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:56.100]   So question for your audience.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.140]   You buy a loaf of bread at the local bakery.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.260]   How soon before it stales?
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.580]   - Two days at best.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:04.420]   - Yeah.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.580]   - If it's really great bread.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.420]   - That's right.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.460]   - The better the bread, the quicker it stales.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:14.460]   You buy a loaf of bread at the neighborhood grocery store.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.940]   How soon before it stales?
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:21.080]   - You've got probably a week and then there's moldy pieces
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.300]   at the end that you, you know, if you're in college
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.100]   and you were maybe trying to scrape that off.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.300]   (laughing)
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.320]   - It can last up to three weeks, depending, right?
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.640]   - You could throw it in the freezer.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.100]   You probably do that with the bakery bread,
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.040]   but it's never the same.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:32.880]   - Never the same.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.700]   - It's never the same.
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.540]   - So the question is why is that?
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.260]   And the answer is sugar.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.480]   The answer is sugar.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.480]   So the grocery store bread had sugar added to it on purpose
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:49.360]   because when you bake it, the sugar does not evaporate.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.820]   It stays in the bread and the sugar is hygroscopic,
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:55.020]   meaning it holds on to water.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.180]   This is a phenomenon that the food industry uses
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.380]   called water activity, okay?
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:02.860]   And so it will hold on to water and so it will stay spongy
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.180]   and will not stale as quickly as the bakery store bread,
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.660]   which did not have that sugar added to it.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.620]   So even something as benign as bread has been turned
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.220]   into something that ultimately leads
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.740]   to chronic metabolic disease.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:23.300]   - We've pivoted somewhat from carbohydrate divided
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.220]   into glucose and fructose to a discussion of sugar.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.960]   Could you tell us the link between sugar and fructose?
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.720]   - So table sugar, what percentage of table sugar is fructose?
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.040]   What percentage of brown sugar is fructose?
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.400]   What percentage of the sugar that's added to food
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.500]   is high fructose corn syrup on average?
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.320]   You know, just because here what we're talking about
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.320]   is what you're describing as an intentional lacing of food
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.620]   with something that's addictive,
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.940]   but that's also processed very differently
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:53.600]   at the level of the kidney, at the level of the liver.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.880]   And it's bad, it's a bad situation.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.320]   - So when we talk about sugar,
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.220]   I think we need to be as careful
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.300]   in describing what we really mean
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.100]   as when we talk about a calorie.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.580]   - I completely agree.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.260]   So for your audience,
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.560]   let's be very, very clear on definitions.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.580]   Let's not use the word sugar
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:21.380]   because it has multiple definitions.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:24.980]   Let's use sucrose.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:29.720]   Sucrose is what you put in your coffee.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.660]   It's the crystals, right?
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.780]   It's cane sugar, beet sugar,
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:39.060]   you know, the stuff that you, teaspoons of, right?
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:42.100]   This was all that was available for many, many years.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.500]   That is one molecule of glucose,
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.860]   one molecule of fructose bound together
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:54.740]   for the chemists out there in O-glycosidic linkage, okay?
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:57.420]   The enzyme in your intestine called sucrose
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:01.020]   cleaves this O-glycosidic linkage in about a nanosecond.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.300]   You absorb the two molecules separately.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.500]   The glucose goes to the entire body,
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.960]   generates an insulin response.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.880]   The fructose goes straight to your liver, generates fat.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.300]   That's sucrose.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.020]   High fructose corn syrup
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.220]   is essentially one molecule of glucose,
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:22.180]   one molecule of fructose, not bound together.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.920]   No O-glycosidic linkage.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.120]   So they're free.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.140]   The enzyme sucrose doesn't care
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:33.020]   because the blond's already broken.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:36.180]   Ultimately, they do the same thing,
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.180]   and that's why high fructose corn syrup and sucrose
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.740]   are indistinguishable metabolically.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:46.780]   What they are is they're very different economically,
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.900]   and the reason is because high fructose corn syrup
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:52.020]   is half the price of sucrose
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:55.980]   because sucrose we get from importing,
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.280]   and high fructose corn syrup we make at home.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:02.260]   Sucrose is in bags.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:05.320]   High fructose corn syrup is in barrels.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.800]   Sucrose you can sell at the store.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.740]   High fructose corn syrup you sell
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:13.020]   to the ultra-processed food manufacturer.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.740]   You can't buy high fructose corn syrup at the grocery store.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:18.900]   So they're very different
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.820]   in terms of what they're used for.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.340]   High fructose corn syrup is particularly egregious
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:30.140]   because it's so miscible, because it's already a liquid.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.020]   So you probably remember Chips Ahoy cookies in the old days.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:38.780]   They often would seem like the sugar
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.300]   in the cookie had crystallized
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.660]   'cause the sugar content was so high.
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.160]   - It's been a while since I've had one.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.580]   They weren't particularly good.
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.900]   - Yeah, well now--
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.700]   - But you eat two of them,
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.140]   and then you think they're good,
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.500]   and then you want to eat four.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.380]   That's what's so odd.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.300]   The first bite is kinda like the,
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.300]   and then it's bombs away.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.760]   - There you go.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.820]   Well now it's a chewy Chips Ahoy cookies.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.540]   - Oh, I remember the chewy Chips Ahoy cookies.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:04.380]   - Remember chewy chips?
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.940]   Well that, that's high fructose corn syrup
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:11.820]   because the two molecules are free,
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.700]   they don't crystallize.
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.820]   So you can actually up the dose.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.440]   Several times throughout today's discussion,
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.160]   you've been talking about the quote unquote food industry.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.280]   Okay, so I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.120]   - I am.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.680]   - But I understand, you know,
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.840]   that most businesses exist to make money.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.780]   Many businesses start off with good intentions and drift
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:40.140]   in order to stay competitive.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:45.280]   And many, many businesses, as we know,
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.020]   not all of which are entirely bad,
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.140]   such as the pharmaceutical industry, right?
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.940]   There are bad, there are instances of like the opioid crisis,
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.440]   but then there are drugs from the pharmaceutical industry
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.480]   that help save lives.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.060]   I mean, that's my stance.
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.060]   The food industry, I think there are good actors
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:03.920]   and there are bad actors,
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.940]   but we're talking about the food industry.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.140]   Okay, well, we can talk about the exercise industry,
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.540]   we talk about the podcast industry.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.760]   I mean, you got good actors and bad actors,
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.500]   but what you've alluded to several times here,
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.340]   and you're more informed than I am,
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:20.340]   is a concerted effort to lace food with a form of sugar
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:26.860]   that makes people crave more of that food,
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.140]   and that is causing metabolic illness,
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.280]   disrupting mitochondria, and on and on.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.120]   - Exactly.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.820]   - And you're the physician, not me.
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:38.260]   You've worked with patients who struggle with obesity
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.980]   and for various reasons, not me.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:45.980]   And so we could probably spend hours, if not days,
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.260]   talking about all the terrible things
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.860]   that the quote-unquote food industry has done,
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:54.100]   but what do you think is the pure motivation, right?
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:57.200]   I don't think that they want people to be sick,
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.220]   but they wanna sell product and this sells more product.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:01.940]   So then it raises two questions.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:07.940]   Why is it that more people don't know this information,
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.060]   although many more will know after today's conversation,
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:14.020]   but, and certainly in government, it's a mix,
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.660]   regardless of what side of the aisle you're on,
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.380]   or if you're right in between.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.840]   There are clearly people that care about
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.220]   the health of themselves and others.
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.800]   So I can understand how things
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.880]   might've gotten to this point,
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.460]   but what do you think are the barriers
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:32.320]   to getting people to appreciate just what a problem this is,
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.700]   and getting people to change their choices
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.340]   in terms of what they're eating?
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.700]   Are they truly addicted to the point where they are sick,
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.160]   they can't make good decisions?
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:43.100]   Like a drug addict who's highly addicted to heroin
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.700]   is a sick person, they have an illness
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.940]   and they need treatment, but until they get that treatment,
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.860]   they can't make good decisions.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.500]   - Let's take an analogy, alcohol.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:58.460]   40% of Americans are teetotalers, never touch this stuff.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:00.460]   - 40% don't drink. - 40% don't drink.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.580]   - Great, I'm not a big fan of alcohol.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.060]   I've never seen it make anyone better
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.180]   at anything that really mattered.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.380]   - No, because it's- - Except drinking.
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.220]   And that doesn't really matter.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.420]   - It's also completely vestigial.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:11.380]   There's no biochemical reaction in the body
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.980]   that requires alcohol, okay?
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.100]   For the same reason, by the way, fructose.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.980]   40% are social drinkers.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.540]   Yeah, you can pick up a beer, put it down,
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.380]   I'm in that category.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:26.300]   10% are binge drinkers, and 10% are chronic alcoholics.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.580]   Okay?
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:33.580]   Now, do you deprive the 40% of social drinkers
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:40.300]   because of the 20% of binge drinkers and chronic alcoholics?
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:43.100]   - Well, I believe people should be in choice,
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.580]   but I believe people should know what they are doing
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.540]   so that they can be in choice, right?
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.220]   Like, do as you, I always say,
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.040]   and I said this about the alcohol episode,
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.540]   which turned out to be one of our most prolific episodes,
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.580]   where I said that more than two drinks,
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:56.700]   zero is better than any,
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.940]   and more than two drinks per week,
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.700]   you need to do other things to offset that,
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.380]   and it's problematic.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.300]   Those are what the data say.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:06.200]   But I would say, do as you want, but know what you're doing.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.100]   - Well, so I would say that that's exactly
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:12.340]   what the food industry wants you to think.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.860]   That is the food industry's mantra,
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.660]   is you have your own choice, personal responsibility.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:25.020]   So the question is, does personal responsibility work?
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.220]   And the answer is, no, it doesn't.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:31.660]   Every public health debacle
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.860]   in the history of mankind
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.060]   started out as a personal health issue
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.380]   before it became a public health crisis.
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:42.700]   And you can pick your personal responsibility issue,
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.760]   whether it be exposures, whether it be addictions,
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.900]   whether it be infections.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.080]   Bottom line is, ultimately,
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.900]   it required a societal response, okay?
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:57.820]   We can talk about syphilis, we can talk about tuberculosis,
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.980]   ultimately needed a public health response.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.900]   We can talk about teen pregnancy, we can talk about--
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.740]   - Tobacco.
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:07.860]   - Tobacco ultimately needs a public health response
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.160]   because the sheer enormity of it
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.820]   and the egregiousness of it
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.340]   requires that public health response.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.280]   Well, turns out, this is no different.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.500]   In order to exercise personal responsibility,
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:26.060]   four criteria have to be met.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.360]   Those four criteria are the following.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.380]   Number one, knowledge.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.300]   You have to have the knowledge
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.540]   because if you don't have the knowledge,
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.160]   then how can you exercise personal responsibility?
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.940]   Well, in fact, the public's being kept from the knowledge.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.640]   We're doing this now in part to entrain that knowledge,
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:48.140]   to get people to understand what the problem is.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.220]   - Yeah, I consider myself pretty informed
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.500]   about nutrition and health,
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:56.500]   but already today I've learned two dozen facts
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.820]   about processing of fructose in calories generally
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.600]   that I had no knowledge of prior.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.700]   - Well, that's good, okay?
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:07.500]   'Cause it's not about the math, it's about the science, okay?
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.440]   They want it to be about calories.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.740]   So we have this thing called food science,
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.580]   we have this thing called nutrition,
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.900]   and we have this thing called metabolic health.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:17.060]   They are not the same.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.580]   Food science is what happens to food
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.820]   between the ground and the mouth.
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.300]   Nutrition is what happens to food
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.400]   between the mouth and the cell.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.940]   Metabolic health is what happens to food inside the cell.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.140]   But all of the chronic diseases that we are suffering from,
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.440]   type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.160]   cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia,
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.120]   fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian disease,
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.540]   those eight diseases, which make up 75%
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.160]   of healthcare expenditures in this country today,
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.620]   are all inside the cell,
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:52.420]   because they are all mitochondrial dysfunction,
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:56.860]   and there is no medicine that gets to the mitochondria.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:00.760]   - Although you and others at Stanford, Harvard, et cetera,
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:02.860]   are starting this with metabolic psychiatry
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.980]   being one instance, right?
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.480]   - Indeed. - And UCSF as well,
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.060]   forgive me, I should have mentioned UCSF up front.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.140]   Your home institution, wonderful institution
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:11.780]   right up the road from Stanford.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:13.260]   So, you know, things are changing.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.000]   People are starting to think about mitochondrial health.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:15.840]   - They are.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.700]   - Okay, so you listed off the first thing.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.440]   You said there are four things that stand is bare.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.300]   First one was knowledge. - Knowledge.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.540]   - Second, access, because if you don't have access,
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.180]   then how can you exercise personal responsibility?
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.580]   - Access to healthier alternatives.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:30.500]   - Exactly.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.580]   - Which means cost-effective.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.420]   I mean, I love berries from the farmer's market
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.720]   more than I love berries from the store.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.500]   I love the farmer's markets generally,
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.760]   but it takes time, energy to go there,
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.460]   and the cost is actually lower
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:47.060]   at the level of what you hand the vendor, typically,
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.060]   but volume is tough to achieve.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:52.180]   - They actually have me at a quota.
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.600]   I'm not allowed to buy as many berries as I want
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.740]   because obviously there are other people who want berries.
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:57.580]   So there's that, right?
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.620]   People have to feed their family that, you know,
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:02.280]   and we're used to eating a lot of volume.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.520]   - But you're able to at least go there.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.820]   - Sometimes, yeah.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:08.900]   - We're talking about people who live in, quote, food deserts.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.300]   We're also talking about people who live in food swamps, okay?
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.560]   When we're talking about food swamps,
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.180]   we're not talking about a plethora of healthy foods.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.260]   We're talking about all the junk.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.980]   That's what they, they live in the swamp of junk.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:25.100]   So if you live in the swamp of junk,
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:28.380]   how are you supposed to exercise personal responsibility?
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:33.140]   Number three, or affordability.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.900]   So you have to be able to afford your choice,
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:37.620]   and society has to be able to afford your choice.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.040]   And right now, we can't afford that choice
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.980]   because healthcare costs right now
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.880]   are at $4.1 trillion a year.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   - But like so many things in behavioral economics and health,
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.600]   it's so hard for people to see that the immediate choice
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.520]   is leading to a higher cost down the road.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.660]   There are just too many nodes of separation
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:03.500]   for people to realize,
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.840]   hey, when I'm reaching for this cereal,
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.880]   as opposed to making waffles for my kids from scratch,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.000]   or, you know, they're thinking time efficiency,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.080]   cost efficiency, volume, the kid's not throwing tantrums
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.420]   'cause they're no longer getting the cereal.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.320]   And it's very difficult to see this is the reason
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.100]   why healthcare costs are going up.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.700]   There are just too many nodes of separation.
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.020]   - Well, couldn't agree more.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:26.720]   But ultimately, it's because the government separates
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.720]   and silos food industry profits from healthcare costs.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.380]   If you actually combine those,
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.620]   'cause they ultimately are the same,
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:38.240]   you would see the problem.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.240]   So globally, the food industry grosses $9 trillion a year.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.240]   Healthcare costs globally cost $11 trillion a year,
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.120]   dietary related healthcare costs.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   Environmental costs cost $7 trillion a year,
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.060]   and productivity costs cost $1 trillion a year.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.540]   So when you do the math,
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.100]   nine minus 11 minus seven minus one
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:10.100]   means that there is a $10 trillion a year deficit
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.800]   because of us cleaning up the mess
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.600]   that the food industry makes.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.440]   - And while numbers like that-
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.760]   - That's not affordable.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.600]   - Right, I agree.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.240]   And while numbers like that land really hard,
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.000]   I find that for myself and for many people,
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.040]   statistics like that are hard to keep in mind in a way.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.120]   There's something about the human brain
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.840]   that hears that and goes, whoa,
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.160]   where like that war costs that much
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.380]   and this food issue costs that much.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.800]   And then we go to the store and we're hungry.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.900]   And the kids are hungry.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:44.280]   And so those nodes of separation,
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.940]   it's almost like a neural slash memory
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.820]   slash prefrontal cortex issue to me.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.860]   And of course I look at everything
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.180]   through the lens of neurobiology.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.020]   - Me too.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.420]   - Not everything, but most everything.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.440]   And so how could I not, how could we not?
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.460]   But then the issue is,
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.380]   well, there's still food on the shelves.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:06.380]   And so what do we do to bring closer together these nodes?
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.180]   What would the government do?
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.620]   So the question is, is there food on the shelves?
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:11.840]   Let me finish the fourth one
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.660]   and then I wanna come back to that point.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:16.360]   Let me just finish a concept.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.540]   So affordability.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:20.880]   And number four, externalities.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.020]   Your choice can't hurt anybody else.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.360]   But what if your choice does hurt somebody else?
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.900]   So like for tobacco, secondhand smoke.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.740]   - Right.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.020]   - Four, alcohol, drunk driving.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.580]   - But what's the argument for teen pregnancy
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:36.400]   that someone else was gonna have to raise the kids?
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.720]   - Exactly.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.780]   - But what about for food?
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.500]   Well, how about the fact that your employer,
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:48.500]   Stanford University, has to pay $2,750 per year
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.840]   in obesity-related healthcare expenses
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.420]   that they have passed on to you
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.860]   even though you're not obese?
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.820]   That is affecting you.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:03.820]   So that guy's obesity right there, that is affecting you.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:07.760]   But there, nowadays, it's especially tricky
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.180]   even to have the conversation.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.040]   I'm willing to have it now,
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.360]   which is that there's this whole concept
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.320]   of fat-shaming, right?
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.520]   So if somebody's obese, whose fault is it?
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.120]   And if we even talk about it,
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:24.360]   are we subject to attack, legitimate attack?
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:30.440]   So calling someone obese at a clinical level,
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.820]   like I mean, you're an expert in endocrinology.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.280]   Don't talk about obesity.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.120]   Let's talk about diabetes.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.160]   - Okay, so talk about the consequence of obesity.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.400]   - Yeah, let's talk about the metabolic health issue itself.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:49.320]   The fact is that diabetes is now 11.4% of America.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.980]   - What was it 20 years ago?
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.440]   - It was, 20 years ago, it was about 8%.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.920]   - I was wondering this earlier.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.540]   20 years ago, there was a lot more margarine
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.780]   in refrigerators, but people were thinner
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:03.260]   and there was less diabetes.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.080]   - Everything you told us about margarine and trans fats
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.160]   is that it's bad, bad, bad.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.480]   Now butter is back, as Time magazine and you said.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.320]   So clearly can't be the transition away from trans fats.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.600]   That's increased obesity.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   So it's gonna be the increase in sugar
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.080]   and these hidden sugars in the foods.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.580]   - Exactly, that's right.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:28.120]   The key though is Pakistan and India and China,
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:33.500]   they are not fat, but they have 14% diabetes rates
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:36.680]   and they're thin and the reason is
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.320]   because of ultra processed food.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.560]   - Are there any countries in the world
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.160]   that don't allow high fructose corn syrup
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.160]   or at least not at the level that we do?
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.960]   - Oh, boat loads, okay.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.960]   There are boat loads of countries
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.200]   that don't import high fructose corn syrup or don't make it.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.740]   - So Scandinavian countries?
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:59.040]   - Scandinavian countries, most of Europe.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.280]   Other than the Asia Pacific Rim, so Japan has it.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.640]   In fact, it was invented in Japan,
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:09.300]   1966 Saga Medical School, Takasaki, et al.
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:14.040]   Korea has it, but Australia does not have it.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.560]   Thailand does not have it,
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:19.000]   but they have just as much of obesity
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.560]   and diabetes problem as we do because they have sucrose.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.360]   Because high fructose corn syrup and sucrose
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.920]   are no different metabolically.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.260]   So it doesn't really matter.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.500]   - Is that one to one?
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.240]   - It's the one to one thing, exactly.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.300]   - Of glucose and fructose.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.200]   - So here's the question, Andrew, okay?
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.720]   So I wanna go back to that.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:41.200]   You said all this food is still on the shelves.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.840]   Is it food?
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.440]   What is the definition of food?
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.080]   - Can I give the definition I think most people would give?
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.000]   That's not necessarily the one I would give,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.720]   but something that contains caloric energy.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.740]   Or like I could eat this microphone,
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:00.440]   but it's not gonna provide much useful energy.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.680]   - The definition of food straight from the dictionary,
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.960]   and believe me, I looked it up and memorized it.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.600]   - I believe you.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.800]   - Substrate that contributes to either growth
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:13.440]   or burning of an organism.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.280]   - Interesting.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:15.320]   - That is the definition of food.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.560]   - So I'm pretty scientific.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.160]   - 100% correct, growth or burning.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.960]   So any substrate that passes your lips
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:27.800]   that contributes to either growth or burning, that's food.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.800]   Okay, let's do it.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.360]   Let's do burning first.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.760]   I just showed you that sugar,
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.640]   which is the marker of ultra-processed food,
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.160]   and 73% of the items in the grocery store
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.160]   are spiked with sugar, inhibits burning.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.780]   It inhibits those three enzymes
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.520]   involved in mitochondrial function.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.240]   Now let's do growth.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:50.080]   My colleague, Dr. Efrat Monsonigo-Ornan,
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.840]   who is the chairman of nutrition
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.400]   at Hebrew University Jerusalem,
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:56.040]   actually looked at this question
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.440]   and showed that ultra-processed food
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.760]   actually inhibits growth.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.560]   It inhibits cortical bone growth.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.800]   It inhibits trabecular bone growth.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.280]   It inhibits cancellous bone growth.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.440]   It inhibits linear bone growth.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.040]   It hijacks growth for cancer
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.920]   because it inhibits mitochondria.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.800]   And so you have to then grow instead of burn.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.800]   - And this was work that was done in in vivo or in vitro?
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.640]   - In vivo.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.800]   - In vivo, so these are people
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.960]   that are eating high amounts of highly processed food.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.800]   - Exactly.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.400]   - How did you find those in the Middle East?
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.280]   - They found, in Israel, they found them.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.960]   So bottom line is if a substrate
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.720]   does not contribute to growth
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.160]   and does not contribute to burning,
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.040]   is it a food?
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.080]   - I see the answer is no.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.280]   - Well, that's 73% of what's in the grocery store.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.120]   So I would argue, you said the food's there.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.600]   No, it's not.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.000]   That's not food.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.920]   In fact, it's consumable poison.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.920]   - So this leads to an important question of what's left.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.040]   You remove all that, what's left.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.200]   Just anecdotally, and what I sometimes call anecdata,
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.080]   you know, I've had several friends in their 40s
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.200]   and early 50s say they wanted to lose weight
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.800]   and get in shape, and the thing that's worked
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:21.520]   every single time for them to lose significant amounts
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.640]   of weight quickly and keep it off,
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.600]   and many of them were already exercising,
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.640]   but then also increase their exercise,
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.080]   was I just, since I'm not a dietician,
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.080]   nutritionist, or anything, I just say,
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:37.080]   eat meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits,
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.760]   you're not gonna eat starches.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.920]   You're not gonna drink alcohol.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.400]   You're not gonna drink soda.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.280]   You can still have coffee, tea.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.200]   You can still have artificial sweeteners.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.760]   I will get to artificial sweeteners in a little bit.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.480]   - We have to go there.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.760]   - And the reason I say no starches,
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.880]   even though I personally eat rice, oatmeal, pasta,
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.200]   things of that sort, some in moderation,
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.240]   depending on what sort of exercise I'm doing and how much,
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.560]   is because of the fact that nowadays
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.720]   many of those things contain fructose,
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.800]   and inevitably, every one of those people
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.920]   is blown away by the fact that it, quote unquote, works,
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.080]   and assumes that it's all because
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.200]   of reduced calorie intake overall,
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:21.840]   and they lose like anywhere from 30 to 55 pounds
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.520]   and keep it off, and they're like, hey, this is great.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.580]   I can actually still eat ribeye steaks and salads,
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.480]   but they're not eating croutons.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.120]   And so in some sense, it looks extreme.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.540]   It sounds ketogenic, but it's nothing like that.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.780]   You're just saying basically stay away from,
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.080]   you're eliminating processed foods,
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:40.340]   you're eliminating liquid calories in general,
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.420]   and on and on.
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.480]   And so there's nothing sophisticated about it.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.920]   And my question to you is how much of that weight loss
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.560]   effect do you think is a calories in
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.520]   versus calories out effect?
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.860]   'Cause they're eating a lot of food, in some cases.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.580]   And how much of it do you think is the elimination
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:04.040]   or near elimination of this fructose or this glucose,
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.440]   fructose combination?
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.200]   - It's nothing to do with the calories.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.240]   It has everything to do with the insulin.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.140]   If you get the insulin down,
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:16.480]   you're not shunting energy to fat.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.080]   You can lose weight.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.080]   Your fat will give up the triglycerides stored in it
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:27.580]   as soon as your insulin goes down.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.020]   Insulin is pushing on your fat cell all the time.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.980]   And as long as your insulin's up,
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.720]   your fat cell can't release it.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.640]   The minute your insulin goes down,
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.880]   you can now engage in what we call lipolysis.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:46.180]   Hormone sensitive lipase is an enzyme in the fat cell
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:48.980]   that is inhibited by insulin.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:52.440]   As soon as the insulin's gone, hormone sensitive lipase
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.440]   can turn that stored triglyceride into free fatty acids
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.320]   and glycerol and release it and you can lose weight.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.960]   So get the insulin down and it all works.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.560]   So the question is, what makes insulin go up?
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.880]   Well, two things, refined carbohydrate and sugar.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.800]   Those are the two things that make insulin go up.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.560]   In addition, branched chain amino acids
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.220]   make insulin go up as well.
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:17.040]   Leucine, isoleucine, valine, which is in corn-fed
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.660]   beef, chicken and fish, processed food.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:25.560]   All right, here's the deal in one concept.
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:29.200]   My colleague, Dr. Carlos Montero,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.320]   who is a professor of public health
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.820]   at the University of São Paulo,
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.220]   has done the world a great service.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:38.660]   He has developed a system for categorization
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:40.960]   of food processing.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:44.520]   It is called the NOVA system, just means new.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.960]   But he has basically categorized every food
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.320]   anywhere in the world into one of four classes.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.380]   Easiest way to explain this would be an example.
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.580]   Let's take an apple.
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:02.560]   NOVA class one would be an apple picked off a tree.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:06.360]   NOVA class two would be apple slices.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.040]   De-stemmed, de-seeded, de-skinned maybe.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.020]   NOVA class three would be apple sauce.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:16.440]   Cooked, macerated, possibly a preservative added,
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.540]   maybe some extra sugar, maybe not.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:22.380]   NOVA class four would be a McDonald's apple pie.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.460]   Now, does that McDonald's apple pie
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.600]   look anything like that apple?
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.640]   No.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.240]   Is there even any apple in it?
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.680]   Maybe a tiny bit. Maybe not.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.060]   Maybe a tiny bit.
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.880]   It's all flavor enhanced, et cetera.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:40.560]   Turns out, and this is epidemiologic data,
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.920]   but nonetheless, prospective epidemiologic data,
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.120]   so it's not useless.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:50.460]   That NOVA class four, that ultra-processed food category,
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:53.100]   which is 73% of the American grocery store,
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.440]   is the class that is associated
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.640]   with all of these chronic metabolic diseases.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.720]   NOVA class one through three, no problem.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:03.820]   - Now, when you say associated,
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.300]   what percentage of one's daily total caloric intake
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.060]   needs to come from NOVA class four
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.980]   before that statement you just made is true?
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:15.020]   Because I love the recommendation you made earlier,
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:19.240]   or the, let's just say, the contour of a,
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:22.300]   you don't have to avoid dessert.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.520]   You can enjoy dessert,
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.740]   but don't eat dessert at other times of day.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.820]   And maybe you don't eat dessert every single night.
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.380]   I mean, is there a rule that people
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.780]   have to eat dessert every single night?
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:34.740]   - So the answer is about seven to 10%
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:36.660]   would be at the upper limit.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:40.340]   - So you can get seven to 10% of your caloric intake,
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:43.480]   daily caloric intake, from these NOVA class four foods,
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.860]   and still- - And still be okay.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:45.700]   - And still be okay.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.540]   - Yeah. - So this is, I know-
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.700]   - But that's not what's happening.
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:50.500]   - Right, I know some very healthy physicians
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.540]   who I used to observe how people, A, moved,
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:58.480]   'cause I would pay attention in our field, right?
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.900]   I was like, oh, you know, people all around me
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:02.820]   at Stanford, UCSF, et cetera, were successful,
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.200]   or else they wouldn't be there.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.380]   I was like, you know, who looks healthy?
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.460]   Who can make it up the stairs
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.220]   and doesn't have to take the elevator?
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.820]   How much exercise are people doing at a given age?
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:13.320]   Are they fanatic, you know, like four in the morning runners?
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.380]   I'm not gonna do that consistently unless I have to.
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.820]   And I observed that, you know,
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.820]   many of the healthiest people I know,
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.260]   they move a lot during the day, they eat very well.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.620]   Many of them skip breakfast or lunch, not always.
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:30.780]   And then I also noticed that they would drink very little
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:34.100]   or no alcohol, but they would enjoy like a,
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:36.260]   there's one physician at UCSF in particular I'm thinking of
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.380]   who really enjoyed his dark chocolate Kit Kat after lunch.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:42.560]   And he's sort of very ceremonial about the unraveling
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.700]   of the foil and the end of the day.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.220]   And I was like, okay, so you're talking about
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:47.820]   that small percentage of calories.
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:51.900]   If that's all you do, hey, you know, God bless you.
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:54.260]   But that's not what people are doing.
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:55.980]   That's the problem.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.780]   Bottom line, that NOVA class four is where all the action is
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.380]   in terms of chronic metabolic disease.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.580]   So the question is, how can you avoid that?
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.520]   How do you know which is which?
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.940]   We have a solution.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:14.940]   So my colleagues and I have developed a web-based tool
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:19.640]   that is available to the entire world right now.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.500]   And you'll put it in your show notes.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:22.480]   - Yeah, we'll put a link to this.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.280]   - Absolutely, it's called PERFECT, P-E-R-F-A-C-T.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.540]   And you can find it at PERFECT.CO.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:34.980]   And what it is, is it's a recommendation engine, not AI.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:38.220]   We're gonna talk about AI in a minute.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:42.180]   But it is a recommendation engine based on the science
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:47.180]   of human metabolism that categorizes foods
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:52.340]   based on not their nutrient content,
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:54.740]   but on their metabolic effect.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:55.580]   - Interesting.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.780]   - And so there is a NOVA filter,
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:00.500]   which will filter out all the NOVA class four stuff.
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.660]   And it will go to your grocery store
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:06.300]   and will tell you what you can buy
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.900]   that will be in NOVA class one through three,
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:13.420]   which turns out to only be 20% of the grocery store.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:14.920]   - It means basically staying on the periphery
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.760]   of the grocery store, right?
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.060]   - Well, that's a lot of it. - In general.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:17.900]   - In general, yes.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:20.260]   - Yeah, the produce, the meat, the dairy, the--
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:23.260]   - All the things you mentioned, in fact.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:27.500]   So I'm not low carb, I'm low insulin.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.760]   And there are a lot of ways to get to low insulin.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.340]   Get rid of the refined carbohydrate, get rid of the sugar,
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:35.500]   increase the fiber, get rid of the branched chain
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:40.460]   amino acids, okay, so eating fish is a good place to be.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:45.460]   Even eating a steak is okay if it's a pasture-fed steak.
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.500]   So let's talk about your steak.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.380]   - Right, which is also better for the animals, right?
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:51.540]   - It is, absolutely.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.600]   So you mentioned marbling before.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.340]   We love our marbling, right?
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.540]   We can cut our US grade A steaks with a butter knife
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.420]   because they're so tender, right?
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:03.940]   You ever been to Argentina?
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:04.900]   - Yeah, my father's Argentina.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.340]   - Oh, right, that's right, you're Argentinian.
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.340]   - Yeah, they only know grass-fed steak.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:12.220]   The idea that cows would eat anything but grass
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:16.060]   is sort of like the idea that fish would fly.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:19.740]   - Absolutely, New Zealand, same thing, okay?
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.120]   The meat is gorgeous, it's homogeneous, it's pink,
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.560]   it's delightful.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.720]   I've been to Argentina, the meat is fantastic,
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.880]   but you have to use a steak knife.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.720]   You can't use a butter knife.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.460]   - And it takes more chewing.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:33.940]   - And it takes more chewing because there's sinew.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:36.240]   It's a different experience entirely.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.500]   It's delicious, but it is kind of a little bit tougher.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.580]   Turns out that marbling is intramyocellular lipid.
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:50.100]   That animal has metabolic syndrome.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:51.580]   - The American corn-fed.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:54.920]   - The American corn-fed animal because that corn
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.980]   is filled with branched-chain amino acids,
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.460]   leucine, isoleucine, valine.
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.220]   Branched-chain amino acids are what's in protein powder.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:05.540]   That's what bodybuilders put in their smoothies
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.700]   to build muscle.
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.780]   And if you're building muscle, that's okay
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:13.780]   because 20% of the amino acids in muscle are branched-chain.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:18.980]   So if you've got a place to put them, have at it.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.080]   - Yeah, there's a need there
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.140]   'cause they're breaking down muscle.
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:21.980]   - Yeah, fine.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.860]   But if you're not, if you're, again, a mere mortal like me,
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:27.740]   you consume those excess branched-chain amino acids,
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:30.100]   they're gonna go to the liver, they're gonna be deamidated
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.740]   like we talked about earlier,
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:34.700]   and they're gonna end up as branched-chain organic acids.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:36.940]   They're gonna flood the mitochondria.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.500]   The mitochondria are not gonna be able
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.540]   to deal with the volume.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:43.860]   And so they're gonna divert the excess
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.580]   and turn that into fat.
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:48.600]   And so now you've got hypertriglyceridemia
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:53.300]   and chance for fatty liver disease and insulin resistance.
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:58.300]   So what kind of meat you eat has a lot to do
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.500]   with your metabolic health.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.460]   - What about the egg, the whole egg?
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:06.940]   Near perfect protein score in terms of its bioavailability.
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:10.060]   - Eggs are terrific.
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:10.880]   - Okay, great.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.180]   - There's nothing wrong with eggs.
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.660]   Now, there are better eggs than others.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.220]   So there are-- - Pasture.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.940]   - Well, there's yellow yolk eggs
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.700]   and there are orange yolk eggs.
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:22.500]   What's the difference between a yellow oak egg
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.420]   and an orange oak egg?
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:27.620]   - I'm guessing that something about the feed
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:30.200]   of the mother chicken.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.940]   And I'm guessing it probably also has something to do
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:35.960]   with choline content?
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.100]   - Omega-3s.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:38.660]   - Ah, interesting.
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:43.660]   - The orange yolk egg has a lot of omega-3s in it.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.580]   - What are other great sources of omega-3s?
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:47.220]   I know some off the top of my head,
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.180]   but I'd like to hear it from you.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:53.100]   - Okay, so marine life is number one, fish.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.660]   - Provided you're not bringing in heavy metals with it.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:47:00.420]   - Well, yes, so that's always the argument.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.860]   The question is, is it the mercury or is it the omega-3s?
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.900]   Ultimately, I think it's the omega-3s that is more important
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:09.600]   but yes, I do understand the mercury issue.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.340]   Ultimately, there are three omega-3s.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:17.980]   There's ALA, alpha-linolenic acid,
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.680]   which you can get in vegetables.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:25.140]   There is EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid,
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.180]   which you can only get in marine life.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.380]   - Fish oil, cod liver oil.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:34.080]   - Right, and finally, DHA, docohexainoic acid,
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.060]   which you also get from marine life
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.320]   but you can get from algae.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.740]   So you can get algal oil, which the vegans will use.
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:45.100]   - Do you personally take anything
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.080]   to increase your omega-3 intake?
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:47.920]   - Yeah, I take fish oil.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.580]   - I know that there's even prescription omega-3s.
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.540]   - I take fish oil.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.420]   - You take a fish oil, yeah.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:55.200]   - I only take three supplements.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.180]   - Okay, I'd like to know what those are.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:58.340]   I will say that I always, always, always say
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.640]   behaviors first, right, do's and don'ts.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.020]   Behaviors, nutrition, then only if needed
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:05.860]   and one can afford it,
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.620]   then supplementation and prescription drugs.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.300]   And I'm a big consumer of supplements
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.740]   and always have been, frankly.
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:11.580]   So what are the three?
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.420]   So you take--
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:13.420]   - Fish oil.
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:16.580]   - And do you take to get above a certain threshold of EPA?
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.940]   - About 1,000 milligrams.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:20.580]   - So you say about a gram a day of EPA, okay.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.860]   - Vitamin C.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:22.700]   - How much vitamin C do you take?
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.940]   - A thousand milligrams a day.
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:25.100]   - You and Linus Pauling.
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:27.680]   - Yeah, well, it's actually from my rosacea.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:32.680]   I've got a skin issue that helps with that.
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.620]   - Interesting.
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:35.320]   - And finally, vitamin D.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.060]   Now I will tell you, vitamin D is a complicated one.
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:42.160]   All right, and we can talk about vitamin D
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.740]   and how either important or non-important it is
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:48.640]   'cause there's a quirk to vitamin D
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.560]   and it's important for your audience to know about it
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.320]   'cause everybody and his brothers, you know,
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.640]   touting vitamin D as the cure for everything.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.440]   - It's sort of funny because you have your supplement,
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.360]   lovers, haters, and agnostics,
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.200]   but vitamin D somehow made it through the chute.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.880]   Like everyone's like pro vitamin D.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.720]   It's really interesting.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.160]   Somehow vitamin D,
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:12.440]   people are comfortable taking a vitamin D gel cap,
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.240]   but like other supplements where you say,
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:17.840]   oh, like maybe this might be good for, you know,
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.560]   like Omega-3s and fish oil,
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.360]   then people are a little bit like more standoffish.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.640]   It's really interesting that the kind of
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.840]   psychosocial stuff around this.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.360]   How much vitamin D do you personally take?
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.080]   - I take 5,000 units a day.
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:29.960]   - Okay, so do I.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:32.200]   - Vitamin D is complicated though.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.680]   Here's the problem.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.400]   If you look at the literature,
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.880]   vitamin D deficiency is associated
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.840]   with all of these chronic metabolic diseases.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.480]   However, supplementation with vitamin D
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.560]   has not fixed any of those.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.800]   So if you're vitamin D deficient,
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.520]   why wouldn't supplementation fix it?
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.360]   Couple of reasons.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.160]   One, one of the reasons for vitamin D deficiency
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.400]   is 'cause everyone's drinking soft drinks.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   That's one reason, but there's a more important reason.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.480]   - Sugar and artificially sweetened soft drinks?
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:09.320]   - Yeah.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.720]   - Can deplete vitamin D, utilize it?
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.280]   - Well, you're not consuming dairy
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.200]   'cause you're consuming soft drinks.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.200]   - But I can't tolerate milk anymore.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.200]   - Well, then you take vitamin D.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.840]   But here's the real nugget of truth.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.940]   And this is a little complicated,
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:27.300]   but the endocrinologists in the audience will get it.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:32.640]   Vitamin D is a pre-pro hormone.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.380]   It's not active at all.
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:39.360]   Vitamin D is converted in the liver first step
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.680]   to a compound called 25-hydroxy vitamin D.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:45.440]   That is a pro hormone.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.360]   It also is inactive.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.180]   It has no activity whatsoever.
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:54.400]   From there, 25-hydroxy vitamin D
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.380]   can be metabolized one of two ways.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:00.920]   It can either be one alpha-hydroxylated in the kidney
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.120]   to the active form, one alpha,
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.600]   one 25-dihydroxy vitamin D,
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.080]   which will then do all of the business of vitamin D,
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.180]   such as calcium absorption from the gut,
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:16.120]   suppression of the immune system
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.940]   at the toll-like receptor four.
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.100]   - That sounds like a bad thing.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:19.940]   - No, that's a good thing.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:21.420]   - I know, but I had to bring that up
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:23.200]   because when you say suppression of the immune system,
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.800]   people go, "Oh, I'm immunosuppressed."
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.680]   That sounds like AIDS.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:28.580]   - It suppresses inflammation.
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:31.600]   It's a good thing, okay, suppression of inflammation.
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.900]   And that's actually the point that we're getting to.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.140]   So there are a lot of good things
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:40.600]   about one 25-dihydroxy vitamin D.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:46.120]   However, that 25-hydroxy D that came out of the liver
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:48.800]   can be metabolized a different way.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:53.720]   It can be 24-hydroxylated in inflammatory tissue,
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:59.600]   like tuberculosis, sarcoid, gut inflammation.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:04.960]   And so you will end up taking your 25-hydroxy D,
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:06.320]   which is a prohormone,
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:11.320]   and turning it into the inactive 24/25-dihydroxy D,
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:13.800]   which then just gets excreted out.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.640]   So in other words, you consumed all this vitamin D
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.080]   and it didn't go where you needed it to go.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.360]   And the reason was because you're inflamed.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:25.400]   You have to fix the inflammation
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.680]   before the vitamin D can be effective.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:31.960]   And 93% of Americans are inflamed.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:36.960]   So giving them vitamin D is not gonna do a damn thing.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.660]   - Got it, is reducing fructose intake
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:42.880]   one of the primary ways to reduce systemic inflammation?
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:43.980]   - Absolutely.
[01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:44.920]   - What are some others?
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.000]   - Reducing oxidative stress in general,
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.380]   so heavy metals like cadmium.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.440]   Cadmium is very high in chocolate,
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.280]   especially South American chocolate, sorry.
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:55.740]   - No, I'm not a fan of chocolate.
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.440]   I occasionally like a little dark chocolate,
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:01.600]   but so if people are going to eat chocolate,
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.480]   they should be careful how much chocolate they eat.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.760]   - Well, especially if it's South American chocolate
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:07.080]   and processed chocolate.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.580]   I mean, the really good stuff.
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:10.680]   - We're gonna be on the hit list of so many industries
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.720]   after this episode comes out.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.900]   - All I can tell you is I've been on the hit list
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.240]   for a decade and I'm still here.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:17.320]   - You're just one big target.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.320]   - Yeah, right.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:21.720]   I gotta, it's on my back, you know, kick me.
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:22.680]   I already got that.
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:29.300]   There are, the main thing is to make that gut work right.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:35.840]   So fiber, short chain fatty acid production from fiber
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.040]   is a huge, you know, boon and benefit.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.140]   - To reduce inflammation.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:41.980]   - To reduce inflammation.
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.060]   - How about improving sleep?
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:46.080]   Is there any evidence that, you know,
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:49.180]   chronic slight sleep deprivation can increase inflammation?
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:51.460]   - Well, what it will do is it'll increase cortisol
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:53.500]   and chronically increased cortisol
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:56.420]   will definitely lead to increased inflammation.
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.700]   You know, which is funny 'cause cortisol
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:59.660]   is usually considered the anti-inflammatory,
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.180]   but only acutely.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:04.020]   Chronic cortisol elevation does the opposite.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.860]   - If we can contribute to,
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:09.960]   I have this secret agenda, which is not a secret,
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.120]   which is that people think cortisol is bad
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:15.980]   when in fact acutely cortisol does wonderful things
[01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:18.300]   provided it's happening at the right time of day.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:21.140]   Late shifted cortisol, bad.
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.940]   Too much or too frequent cortisol, bad.
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:25.940]   But cortisol, you need it.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.020]   It's so essential.
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.620]   And I think most people just hear cortisol
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:30.320]   and it's been associated with all things bad
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.140]   and maybe we can help shift that narrative.
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:33.240]   - Yeah, I'm very happy.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:35.440]   I mean, as an endocrinologist, you know, this is,
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.880]   you know, this is my wheelhouse is where I live.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:43.520]   Cortisol is a good news, bad news deal like so many things.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.520]   Short-term gain for long-term pain, okay?
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:51.220]   So when you are in what we call allostasis,
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:55.200]   that is perturbation of homeostasis,
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.440]   that is a stress, an acute stress,
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:04.180]   cortisol is one of the things that helps you manage that
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.980]   bodily and mental stress.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:11.460]   So an English test, a car accident,
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:14.960]   running away from the lion, you know, the famous, you know,
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.140]   pygmy running away from the lion.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:21.080]   All of those require cortisol in order to manage
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.960]   and mitigate that stress.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.680]   - The upcoming 2024 election.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:27.100]   - That's chronic stress.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:31.780]   That is not acute stress, that's the worst.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:35.080]   - That'll be the only mention of politics on this podcast.
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:36.940]   - And we don't have to go there.
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:39.460]   But we're all chronically stressed.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:43.440]   And we can talk about why that is and what's going on.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.180]   And I'm actually very interested in that.
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:49.040]   And a colleague of mine in Paris and I have built
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.580]   a computational model of the limbic system,
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:55.440]   which focuses on the stress center of the brain,
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.200]   the amygdala, to understand how chronic stress
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.000]   is different from acute stress and how that chronic stress
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.900]   ultimately leads to metabolic and mental health disaster.
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:09.680]   - Very interested in learning more about that.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.880]   Before we touch on that, you've worked a lot with kids.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.600]   People age, as you put it, zero to 19.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:22.080]   I don't know about the exact numbers,
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.240]   but when I was growing up, there were some kids in school
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:27.700]   that were overweight, but it was the occasional kid.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.640]   - Right.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.040]   Now it seems, depending on where one draws the threshold
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.280]   for overweight, it seems that there are a lot of kids
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:36.080]   that are overweight.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.080]   - How about 25% obese and 40% overweight?
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.740]   - Okay, so obviously a serious problem.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:44.580]   - Serious problem.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.760]   - Now and going forward.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.740]   What about adults in the U.S.?
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.160]   I remember seeing at a meeting a map of obesity in the U.S.
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:54.620]   and over time, and it very quickly filled in
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:56.960]   from very few people were obese to very many.
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.960]   Colorado was this beacon of fit people,
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:04.760]   but now it's no longer-
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:05.800]   - And that's bullshit too.
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:06.840]   - Oh, okay, cool.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:07.800]   - I'll tell you why.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:09.160]   There are four things that can increase
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:12.800]   mitochondrial biogenesis.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:13.920]   - Are you gonna tell me altitude is-
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:17.120]   - Cold, that's why Colorado is less obese.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:20.280]   Altitude, that's why Colorado is less obese.
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:23.400]   And what were the other two?
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.840]   But those were the reason.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.400]   It had nothing to do with being more fit.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:29.720]   It had to do with cold and altitude.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:32.840]   Example, Switzerland compared to Germany,
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.680]   they got the same crappy food,
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.520]   but Switzerland has half the obesity that Germany does.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.240]   Because Switzerland is higher.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.120]   - Oh, I love the food.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:42.800]   When I go to Munich, I love the schnitzels
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.640]   and the sauerkraut. - Yeah, it's wonderful.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:46.800]   They got that in Switzerland too.
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.920]   - Okay, so they have great food.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:50.200]   - Switzerland is less obese.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.200]   Same way Colorado is less obese.
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:54.100]   It's because of the altitude.
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.460]   - You mentioned cold.
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:57.040]   Many listeners of this podcast
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:00.760]   are at least interested in some also practice
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.980]   deliberate cold exposure, cold showers, cold plunges,
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:05.840]   mainly for the, I think the best data
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.680]   are the increase in catecholamines,
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.840]   epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine that are long lasting.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.320]   People feel a big state shift.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.480]   They feel better.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.700]   But when one looks at the effects on metabolism,
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:16.960]   they're pretty slight.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:18.280]   - They are slight. - They're slight.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.160]   However, studies like that, to me,
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:24.220]   always seem short-sighted in the sense
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:27.980]   that if there's a longer arc of effect on the mitochondria
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:29.440]   that's affecting other things
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.620]   in terms of how calories are processed
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:36.660]   or how calories are feeding into mitochondrial function
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.420]   or dysfunction, there I could see how it might shift
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:42.420]   the scale, so to speak.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:45.700]   I mean, cold is an amazingly powerful stimulus.
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:49.780]   And I think of light, cold, food, movement.
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:52.340]   It's kind of like the core four ways
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:54.660]   in which you can shift physiology easily.
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.780]   - All of these things are eminently manipulable
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.600]   and for almost zero dollars, okay?
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.420]   But you have to know what you're doing.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:06.380]   And right now, we've been actually kept from that knowledge.
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:09.180]   And if you're addicted,
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:11.980]   it's really hard to unaddict yourself.
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:14.380]   - So that brings us back to this thing
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:19.380]   about food industry conspiracies, government conspiracies,
[01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:20.740]   and the rest.
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:25.300]   Boy, this is going to be an interesting section.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:28.700]   But what do we do?
[01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:31.180]   So if you and I go up to Capitol Hill.
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.020]   - Which I've done.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:34.780]   - Yeah, which you've done, and maybe I'll join you someday.
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:39.980]   And you're at UCSF, I'm down at Stanford.
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.420]   You're a clinician, I'm a scientist
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:45.340]   and a public health advocate, podcaster.
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:47.820]   And we explain to people, hey, listen,
[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:50.820]   the food is laced with a drug, it's not even really food.
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.880]   - That's right, it's not food.
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.120]   - It's an aggregate of food and non-food parts
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.360]   that make you think it's food.
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.700]   It's sort of like telling people, hey, your kids are,
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:00.000]   they're swimming in a swimming pool, looks like water,
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.740]   but it's actually part poison and it's harming them.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:05.140]   It's giving them, if you say those kinds of things,
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:07.620]   I mean, congressmen and women are,
[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:10.640]   they're like reasonably smart people, right?
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.720]   I mean, aren't they gonna do something about it?
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:13.560]   - No.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:14.580]   - So where is the conflict?
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:18.260]   Is it that the food industry has the government
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.140]   by the short hairs?
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.180]   - That's exactly right.
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:22.000]   - And they have them by the short hairs where?
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.540]   I mean, is it, are they lining their pockets?
[02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:28.540]   I mean, where is the leverage actually exerted?
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:31.180]   - Okay, so they are lining their pockets, that's number one.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:33.020]   That is absolutely true, and we have the data
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:34.260]   to support that.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.180]   Blanche Lincoln, who was a senator from Arkansas,
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:38.740]   who was the chairman of the nutrition committee,
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:40.580]   you had to see her campaign contributions
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:42.060]   every time she was up for reelection.
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.580]   - So it's all about getting reelected,
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:48.060]   or it's about them having a third home in the Hamptons?
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.920]   - I think it's the third home in the Hamptons
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:50.760]   more than anything.
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:53.820]   - Okay, so it's really as bad as some of the documentaries
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:55.100]   would make us believe. - Without question.
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:55.940]   Without question.
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:56.780]   - Goodness.
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:58.120]   - And we have the data.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:02.720]   There is an organization that I absolutely wanna call out
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:07.500]   because they are the most egregious political organization
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:08.840]   on the face of the earth.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.680]   They're called the American Legislative Exchange Council,
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.640]   ALEC, or A-LIC, and they write bills.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:18.840]   They are a bill mill, okay?
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.780]   And they are for whoever gives them money.
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:23.960]   And who gives them money?
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:28.960]   Big pharma, big agra, big oil, and big food.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.620]   - So you're including big pharma.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:31.460]   You're a physician.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:32.400]   You've written scripts before.
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.380]   You've written prescriptions for patients before.
[02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:36.360]   Isn't that pharma that provides the drugs
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.000]   that allows your patients to feel better?
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.160]   - Well, the question is, do they?
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.260]   Do they feel better?
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.180]   This is a big question.
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:44.020]   You wanna go there?
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:44.860]   We can go there.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.900]   - But you're writing the script.
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:49.980]   I mean, I'm not trying to challenge you, but I see.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:52.980]   So you don't, there have to be instances
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.180]   where someone's thyroid deficient
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:55.500]   and you give them a drug.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:58.960]   - Absolutely, so if you've got a disease
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.740]   and a medicine will replace what's missing, sure, okay?
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:06.220]   So for deficiency diseases, which as an endocrinologist,
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:08.980]   that's what I do, absolutely.
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:12.140]   And I did that with no compunction
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:15.480]   of impropriety whatsoever.
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:18.260]   But that's not what we're talking about here.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.060]   Let's talk about what we're really talking about.
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:26.060]   Let's start with statins, statins lower LDL.
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:32.480]   Okay, do statins reduce heart disease?
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:34.420]   Yes or no?
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:39.220]   - I seem to be whiffing today on all the quizzes
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.920]   and it's kind of becoming fun for me at this level.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.080]   I'm gonna go with no, but I will say, you know,
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.500]   my friend and I think his expert physician as well,
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.280]   you know, Peter Attia and others, you know,
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.740]   has talked about some of the positive attributes
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.980]   of statins in certain cases for certain patients.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:56.920]   - In certain cases, that's exactly right.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.900]   And I completely agree.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:00.340]   And by the way, Peter's a friend and, you know,
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.980]   someday we'll, you know, all, you know,
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:04.260]   go out drinking together.
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:06.020]   - Well, I won't drink, but how about
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:06.860]   if we share a steak?
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:08.740]   - Share a steak, absolutely.
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:09.580]   You got it.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:12.580]   - You guys, I don't know if he drinks a little bit.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:13.820]   - If you're listening, okay.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.660]   - He drinks a little bit.
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:15.500]   - Porterhouse on me.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:18.020]   - Yeah, I don't do the dessert or the alcohol anymore.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:20.660]   But I'm, and it's not so I can live to be 120.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:21.940]   It's so I can wake up the next morning
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:24.140]   and keep up with you guys.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:25.740]   - It's fine, yeah, I get it.
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:31.340]   So for primary prevention, that is your LDL's high,
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.460]   you need a statin.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:33.980]   That's primary prevention.
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.300]   You haven't declared yourself.
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:36.940]   You haven't had an event.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:41.940]   For primary prevention, the mean increase in lifespan
[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:46.100]   for being on a statin is four days.
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:46.940]   - Four days?
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:47.780]   - Four days.
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:48.620]   - Four days.
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:49.540]   Sorry, I have to chuckle.
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:50.780]   That's a--
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:55.660]   - And the risk for diabetes is 20% increase.
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:58.460]   - What about any improvement in quality of life?
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:03:59.300]   - Done.
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:00.580]   For primary prevention.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:03.420]   Now for secondary prevention, for secondary,
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:05.140]   in other words, you've already declared yourself.
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:06.820]   You already have a problem.
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:10.460]   For secondary prevention, that's where statins shine.
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:12.700]   So there's a value to them.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.700]   I'm not arguing that.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.220]   And if you have familial hypercholesterolemia,
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:19.660]   which is one in 500, okay, not only do you need a statin,
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:23.820]   but you need a low-fat diet and a priest, okay?
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:27.860]   So there is definitely a value to statins,
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.920]   but not for primary prevention.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.100]   But that's what every doctor's doing.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:36.620]   Oh, your LDL, it's over 80, you need a statin.
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.460]   That's ridiculous.
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:39.100]   That is absolutely a joke.
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:41.940]   And the data show that.
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:46.280]   In fact, in fact, my colleague Asim Malhotra in the UK
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.340]   participated in an analysis
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:52.140]   where they took the entire UK population,
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:55.900]   and they took out everybody under age 65.
[02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:58.260]   So you're looking at people 65 to 90.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:01.300]   And it turned out that the LDL level
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:03.400]   correlated with longevity.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:06.900]   The higher the LDL, the longer they lived
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:10.800]   when you took out all the people who had problems.
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:13.420]   So LDL is not really the problem.
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:15.500]   And the reason is 'cause there are two LDLs.
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:16.860]   There's one called large buoyant.
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.800]   There's one called small dense.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.300]   Turns out dietary fat raises your large buoyant.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:24.020]   Your large buoyant is irrelevant.
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:28.220]   It is cardiovascularly neutral.
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:30.220]   But that's the one that statins affects.
[02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:34.680]   The small dense, that's the atherogenic particle.
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.920]   When your small dense LDL is high,
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:41.260]   that means you are not clearing triglyceride peripherally
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:43.820]   because that's what small dense show you.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:47.260]   That's what happens to triglyceride,
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:48.620]   they become small dense.
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:51.900]   - Can I take a guess and say
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:54.540]   that the best way to reduce small dense
[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:56.780]   is to reduce insulin?
[02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:58.960]   - Yes, by reducing sugar.
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:03.340]   Because that triglyceride is made in the liver.
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:06.860]   It's all palmitate and that's the only fat
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:08.900]   that the liver knows how to make.
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:13.900]   And so triglyceride is your liver output of carbohydrate.
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:16.800]   That's how you have to look at triglyceride.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.860]   So triglyceride turns out to be much more important
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:23.140]   as a cardiovascular risk factor than LDL ever was.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:26.380]   - So does big pharma and big food,
[02:06:26.380 --> 02:06:28.140]   do they know all of this?
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:31.480]   - Yes, I know they know 'cause they've told me so.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:33.980]   But they have statins to sell.
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:38.900]   - And foods in the NOVA class four.
[02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:40.780]   - They know this too.
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:45.780]   - So I'm an optimist or what's it gonna take
[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:47.900]   to really move the needle?
[02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:49.900]   I mean, you described the four barriers.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:53.600]   We're trying to add to the knowledge component now.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.900]   What's it gonna take?
[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:59.260]   Going to take having a president in office
[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:02.820]   or congress people in office that really understand
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:04.700]   and care about this stuff?
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:05.620]   - Yeah.
[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:07.860]   - I mean, to really revamp the whole system.
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:13.540]   - So right now, the system is completely and utterly broken.
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:14.860]   Completely and utterly broken.
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.220]   And there's a reason why it's completely and utterly broken
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.380]   'cause the food industry likes it that way.
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:21.740]   - Well, it's profitable for them, obviously.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:24.940]   - There are 51 different federal agencies
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:27.820]   that manage our food, 51.
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:30.220]   And none of them know what the other one's doing.
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:33.380]   And the food industry likes it that way.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:38.100]   - So communication across these 51 organizations would help?
[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:43.100]   - Well, if we had a centralized food czar or food,
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:47.860]   if we split the food off the FDA,
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:52.460]   because it's not the FDA, it's the DA,
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:55.100]   or the FDA is not the Food and Drug Administration,
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:56.740]   it's the Federal Drug Administration.
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:58.500]   They spend a lot of time on drugs.
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.660]   They spend almost no time on food.
[02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:02.300]   - Well, let's think about where there's been success.
[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:04.540]   So I can recall when people smoked on planes.
[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:08.380]   I actually recall going to a gym in Europe
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:11.060]   and there was an ashtray molded into the squat rack.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:11.900]   - Yep.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:12.900]   - That was telling.
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:13.780]   - Yep.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:16.180]   - I don't see people smoking cigarettes
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.740]   around Stanford Hospital anymore.
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:19.940]   But I remember when they initially said
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:21.820]   that people couldn't smoke anywhere
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:24.340]   except in this one little designated area.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.020]   And that's typically what you see nowadays.
[02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:29.260]   And my understanding of the anti-smoking campaign,
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:31.460]   at least for kids, for people 18 and younger,
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:34.300]   was that telling people it was bad for their health
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:35.300]   didn't work.
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:38.500]   Showing them lungs that were decrepit didn't work.
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:41.260]   What worked was showing them commercials
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:45.060]   of cackling, hand writhing white guys
[02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:49.940]   who were talking about how much money they were making
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:54.820]   off of these naive kids who were buying cigarettes
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:55.860]   and other tobacco products.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:59.220]   So it became the effective campaign
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:01.000]   to end smoking in young people
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000]   was to hijack their inherent rebelliousness of youth.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.140]   And then they were like, "No, we're not gonna smoke.
[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:10.240]   "Stick it to them."
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.340]   Like, you know, as my friend calls it,
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:15.800]   like the two-finger business card, like no.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:18.460]   And so that worked.
[02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:19.300]   That worked.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.780]   - Vaping's making a comeback.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:21.960]   Vaping is a separate episode.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.800]   We won't get into that.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.120]   But because nicotine is still addictive.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:28.380]   But you don't see a lot of people smoking cigarettes.
[02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:29.220]   So it worked.
[02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:31.020]   Like something that you would never imagine
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:32.460]   could ever work, worked.
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:34.260]   - Well, so yes, no.
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:35.420]   I mean, that's part of it.
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:36.840]   I'm not gonna tell you that it's not.
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.060]   It is part of it.
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:40.620]   And we actually have an example
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:41.860]   of how that could be applied
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:46.020]   to another toxic substance, sugar.
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:48.600]   We had Berkeley versus Big Soda.
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:51.780]   You know, that's how Berkeley ended up with its soda tax.
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:54.240]   That dates back to 2015.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:55.080]   - The city of Berkeley.
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:56.420]   - City of Berkeley.
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:59.040]   We just celebrated the five-year anniversary
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:01.040]   of the Berkeley soda tax.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.140]   And we've been able to actually look.
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:07.360]   Gestational diabetes, way down.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.460]   Obesity, down slightly.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:10.980]   Not a lot, but a little bit.
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:14.060]   Cardiovascular disease, down.
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:18.620]   Dean Schillinger and Chris Madsen at UCSF and UC Berkeley
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:20.500]   just presented at San Francisco General
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.120]   just three weeks ago.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:24.160]   - So a soda tax like the cigarette tax.
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:25.800]   - Like this-- - Just makes soda expensive.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:26.640]   - Exactly.
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:28.240]   - So you're telling me that a can of Coke
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:31.480]   that I buy on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:34.320]   costs more than a can of Coke that I buy
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.640]   on University Avenue in Palo Alto?
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:37.600]   - It does.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.600]   - Huh, okay.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.160]   - Buy a dime.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.080]   - And that was sufficient enough
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:43.880]   to create this kind of change?
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:45.480]   - Well, yes, it is.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.320]   - 'Cause money hurts.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.960]   - 'Cause money hurts, exactly.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:52.260]   So, Andrew, there have been four, count 'em,
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:55.840]   four cultural tectonic shifts in America
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:57.400]   in the last 30 years.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:00.640]   And they're all undeniable, here they are.
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:04.200]   Number one, bicycle helmets and seat belts.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.760]   - Everybody uses those.
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:08.600]   - Two, smoking in public places.
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.980]   - Nobody does that.
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:12.540]   - Three, drunk driving.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:15.280]   - Hopefully fewer people are doing that.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.400]   - Four, condoms in bathrooms.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:19.560]   - Condoms in bathrooms?
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.260]   - In bathrooms, in public bathrooms.
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:22.880]   - Yeah, you see those more available.
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:24.360]   - Okay, all right.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:29.360]   30 years ago, if a legislator stood up in a state house
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:33.120]   and proposed legislation for any one of those four,
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:34.560]   and I don't care if it's in a state house
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:37.560]   or in Congress or in Parliament or in the Duma
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:39.200]   or anywhere else in the world,
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:41.360]   they'd have gotten laughed right out of town.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:45.920]   Nanny state, liberty interest, get out of my kitchen,
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:48.260]   get out of my bathroom, get out of my car.
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:50.260]   Okay, today, they're all facts of life.
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:54.780]   All right, nobody's bellyaching about any of those.
[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:59.100]   The point is, we were able to solve those
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:03.440]   for public health tobaccos.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.320]   How did we do it?
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.600]   How did we solve those four?
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.600]   No one could imagine that we would ever solve smoking, right?
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.200]   But we did, sort of.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:16.320]   I mean, we brought consumption down by half.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.480]   Okay, that's pretty good when you think about it.
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:19.320]   For an addictive substance--
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.560]   - How many fewer people are dying
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.200]   of lung cancer nowadays in the US?
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.400]   - It's like 80% lower.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.480]   - Well, there's also been improvements in treatment, but--
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:29.480]   - Yeah, but no, it's the incidence--
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:31.320]   - But diagnosed with the incidence.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:32.140]   - Incidence has gone down.
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:32.980]   - Amazing.
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:35.400]   - Okay, because tobacco's gone down.
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.960]   So the question is, how did that happen?
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:41.440]   The answer is very, and why did it take 30 years to do it?
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.460]   We taught the children, the children grew up,
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:50.460]   and they voted, and the naysayers are dead.
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:56.460]   That's how you make a cultural tectonic shift.
[02:12:56.460 --> 02:13:02.160]   So, we now have this real food movement.
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.040]   We have people who are arguing against ultra-processed food.
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:10.600]   We have kids who are demanding different in their schools.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:15.000]   And by the way, what is the biggest fast food franchise
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.840]   in the United States?
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:19.460]   - I'm gonna get this wrong, so--
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:20.300]   - Try me again.
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:21.640]   - I don't know, I've never tried it,
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:24.940]   but I've heard of, is it Chick-fil-A?
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:25.780]   - Nope.
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:26.600]   - Is it McDonald's?
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:27.760]   I don't know.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:30.720]   - It is this nation's public schools.
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:32.240]   - Ah.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:37.240]   - You can add up McDonald's, Subway, Burger King, Chick-fil-A,
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:44.400]   and Wendy's, and every other fast food franchise,
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:48.000]   Jack in the Box, every fast food franchise
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.840]   in the entire country, and it would only be half
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:53.400]   our nation's public schools.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.600]   - Wow, so could you imagine a world
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:01.600]   where there were no class three or class four NOVA foods
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:04.400]   allowed in public schools?
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:06.180]   - And we're doing it.
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:09.380]   So I am the chief science officer of a nonprofit,
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:12.920]   and put this in the show notes, called Eat Real,
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:17.760]   eatreal.org, and we have a new business model
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.920]   for public schools.
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:25.080]   So in 1971, the Department of Education
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:29.940]   issued an administrative ordinance called Resolution 242,
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:34.000]   and they did this purely on monetary reasons.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.080]   This was under Nixon, and what this Resolution 242 said
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:42.800]   was that all school cafeterias all throughout the country
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:44.120]   had to make book.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:48.400]   They had to basically cover their costs.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:51.200]   They couldn't be loss leaders for the school.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:54.840]   They had to fend for themselves.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:57.120]   Well, this sent every food service director
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:00.760]   in the country scurrying for how am I gonna do this,
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:04.520]   'cause I got all these lunch ladies,
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:08.160]   which personnel and food preparation equipment
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:11.600]   and costs that they're mounting,
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.440]   how am I going to break even?
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.480]   They couldn't do it.
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:21.480]   So in walks Aramark and Cisco and Guggenheim and McDonald's,
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:26.440]   and they say, "Hey, we'll do it for you.
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:29.060]   "We'll provide every kid in America
[02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:32.600]   "with a nutritious meal every single day."
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:33.560]   - Hot lunch.
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.520]   - Well, they didn't say hot.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:36.740]   They just said lunch.
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:38.400]   Nutritious, they said nutritious,
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:40.000]   and I put that in air quotes too,
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.200]   'cause it wasn't nutritious.
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:45.740]   And here's the added benefit.
[02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:48.720]   You can take your food preparation facilities
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:52.080]   and your footprint in the school,
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.160]   and you can turn that into classrooms
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.320]   'cause you're gonna need 'em.
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.140]   And that was the goal.
[02:15:58.140 --> 02:15:59.760]   Because as soon as you've moved
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:01.980]   the food preparation facilities out of the school,
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:03.880]   you are now hostage to the food industry
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:05.360]   for the rest of your life.
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:08.360]   - And I could also see how that allows room for them
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.400]   to use these commoditized foods,
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:12.120]   foods that have very long shelf life.
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:12.960]   - Exactly.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:14.400]   - Right, because you wanna make sure
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:18.120]   that if you only sold 2/3 of the lunches
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.640]   that were prepared that on next Tuesday after the weekend,
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:23.600]   that you could still give them food that isn't moldy.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:24.720]   - Exactly right.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:28.480]   And I will tell you, so that's how it happened.
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:31.960]   And you can actually trace IQ scores
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:35.520]   and reading and math scores in this country
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:38.420]   down from 1971 to today.
[02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:42.760]   - When I went to school, I was allowed to get,
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:44.940]   I called it hot lunch 'cause it was usually hot.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:48.820]   I was allowed to get the school lunch one day a week.
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:49.660]   - One day a week.
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:51.940]   - Two days, I had to bring my lunch.
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:53.420]   That one day was pretty special,
[02:16:53.420 --> 02:16:55.040]   like you felt like you were getting a treat.
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.460]   It was usually like corn dog or a hamburger.
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:00.540]   The hamburger was pretty paltry, but the-
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:01.700]   - It's a commoditized hamburger.
[02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:03.580]   - Yeah, a commoditized hamburger.
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:05.620]   You had to go looking for the patty portion
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.560]   and the bread was sweetened.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:09.140]   And so it was different,
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:11.460]   but I don't remember nearly as much obesity.
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:14.620]   I went to high school in the early '90s.
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:18.120]   So you're saying that now, if I went to a high school,
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:23.120]   it would be a lot more sodas and donuts and pizza and-
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:24.100]   - Got it.
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:26.720]   Yeah, pizza's a vegetable, didn't you know?
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:27.640]   - They claim it's a vegetable.
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.160]   - Congress said pizza's a vegetable.
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:31.100]   Amy Klobuchar made pizza a vegetable.
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:31.940]   - Maybe they need their eyes checked.
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:36.680]   - Because the biggest frozen pizza producer is in Minnesota.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:41.760]   - I mean, the ketchup is a vegetable was a stretch,
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:44.300]   but at least it made sense on the Nova system
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:47.960]   of going from tomato all the way to ketchup.
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:48.800]   - To ketchup.
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:49.940]   - Since high fructose corn syrup
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:53.600]   is the primary ingredient in ketchup.
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:54.440]   - Indeed.
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:58.500]   - So the point is that our kids are suffering
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:03.500]   under the weight, the burden of this chronic disaster
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:07.300]   of ultra processed food, which is not food.
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:09.760]   And no wonder they're all obese
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:14.760]   and sick and doing so poorly in school.
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.400]   And by the way, also depressed.
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:20.320]   Ultra processed food has now been shown
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:23.100]   in three separate studies to correlate
[02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:25.320]   with depression in teenagers.
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.280]   - So what is the relationship between processed food
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:31.960]   or maybe we call it Nova system level three, four foods
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.840]   and depression and other psychiatric challenges?
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:40.840]   And if you could, you separate out metabolic syndrome
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:44.400]   from obesity in answering that.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.520]   Like, is there something inherently depressing
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:50.680]   about carrying excess adipose tissue,
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:55.020]   setting aside any kind of aesthetic stuff,
[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:57.640]   you know, how people want to look or perceived,
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:18:59.080]   you know, just, is there anything bad
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.040]   about carrying a lot of body fat
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.680]   independent of the metabolic syndrome
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.880]   for mood and overall sense of wellbeing?
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.600]   - No, I'm really glad you asked that, Andrew.
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:09.800]   And we should have actually covered this earlier.
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:12.900]   Everyone thinks fat is fat.
[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:15.280]   As we've learned, fat is not fat.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:20.280]   And a fat is not a fat, but body fat is not body fat.
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:22.560]   There are three fat depots
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:26.720]   and they are metabolically different.
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.000]   The first is the,
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.520]   does this bathing suit make me look fat fat?
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.600]   By the way, never answer that question.
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:41.040]   That's called subcutaneous fat or big butt fat, if you will.
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:42.180]   So here's the question.
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:46.920]   How many pounds or kilos of subcutaneous fat
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:50.920]   do you have to gain before you become metabolically ill?
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:52.280]   - I have no idea.
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:55.160]   - About 10 kilos, about 22 pounds.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:57.320]   - Okay. - Why?
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:00.200]   The reason is because that subcutaneous fat
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.520]   drains into the systemic circulation.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:08.440]   So you have to have a lot of cytokines
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:12.040]   coming from those subcutaneous adipocytes
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:16.860]   to raise the blood level of cytokines
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:19.000]   to the point where it starts doing damage
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.220]   at the level of the liver.
[02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:21.940]   - So fats are releasing cytokines,
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:23.140]   which are pro-inflammatory?
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:23.980]   - Exactly.
[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:25.120]   - And they're doing that at rest.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:26.360]   Any fat cell?
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.520]   - Any fat cell.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.640]   - Okay. - Any fat cell.
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:31.460]   But if it's going to the systemic circulation,
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:34.420]   you have a volume of distribution of six liters.
[02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:37.920]   So you have to lose, you have to have a lot of cytokines
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:39.560]   to get the concentration up.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:42.380]   - Now, just out of fairness to the fat,
[02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:46.520]   how many cytokines does a muscle cell release?
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.360]   I mean, are we unfairly picking on adipose tissue?
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:52.800]   'Cause why would adipose tissue be pro-inflammatory?
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:54.320]   I mean, a single fat cell.
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:59.160]   I've got a fat cell sitting in my shoulder someplace, right?
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:01.820]   I mean, I'm not zero fat at my shoulder.
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.560]   Why would it be pro-inflammatory?
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:07.640]   - So in fact, the fat cell itself is not.
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:09.520]   Here's what happens.
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:12.040]   The fat cell has a fat vacuole.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:16.180]   It has a storage place for this lipid droplet.
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:19.320]   You stuff it, you stuff it, you stuff it,
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:22.100]   the fat vacuole gets bigger, bigger, bigger.
[02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:26.520]   The perilylipin border that encompasses that fat vacuole,
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:30.080]   that borders the space,
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.560]   ultimately can't get any bigger,
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.660]   and it starts breaking down.
[02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:38.860]   When that happens, it spills the grease
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:41.120]   into the fat cell.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:45.560]   The fat cell dies, becomes necrotic.
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:49.880]   That calls macrophages in to clean up the grease,
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:53.800]   and it's the macrophages that release the cytokines.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:58.120]   So in fact, the fat cell is not the problem.
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:03.120]   It's the breakdown of the grease
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:06.280]   that leads to the macrophage activation.
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:07.720]   That's the problem.
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:10.780]   But when you do it in subcutaneous fat,
[02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:14.040]   it's going into this six-liter tank,
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:17.480]   and so the concentration doesn't go up very much.
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:22.400]   So 10 kilos before you start seeing some effect.
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:25.380]   Fat depot number two,
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:29.340]   visceral or big belly fat.
[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:34.680]   Now, how many pounds or kilos of big belly fat
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:38.120]   do you have to gain before you get metabolically ill?
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.380]   - I don't know, but I'm guessing it's less than 22 pounds.
[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:41.560]   - It's way less.
[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:43.000]   - Oh, for once I got an answer right today.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.720]   - Yeah, that's right. (laughs)
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:48.040]   About five, about five pounds.
[02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:49.780]   Now, the question is why?
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:54.240]   Number one, the visceral fat does not drain
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:56.960]   into the systemic circulation.
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:58.720]   It drains into the portal vein,
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:00.240]   which goes straight to the liver.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:02.000]   So you're getting a bigger load
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000]   going straight to the liver of cytokines.
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.300]   - Not to the kidney.
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.140]   - Not to the kidneys.
[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:07.480]   - The good thing about getting an answer wrong, folks,
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:10.040]   is that you never forget the correct answer.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:11.760]   That's what I always tell my students, right?
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:13.200]   So I'll never forget that.
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:14.080]   - Indeed.
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:15.160]   - Got it.
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:18.800]   - And the question is what made the visceral fat
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:20.140]   in the first place?
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:21.760]   Was it calories?
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:23.200]   Nope.
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:24.700]   It's cortisol.
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:26.440]   It's stress.
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:27.400]   It's the combination
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:29.720]   of the sympathetic nervous system and cortisol.
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:32.620]   And the reason we know this is because you can take patients
[02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:34.400]   with major depressive disorder,
[02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:37.160]   with endogenous depression, who are suicidal,
[02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:39.100]   who have to be admitted to the hospital
[02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:42.500]   to keep themselves from killing themselves,
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:44.400]   stick them in a scanner,
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:47.200]   and they are losing subcutaneous fat like crazy
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:48.940]   'cause they're not eating,
[02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:50.840]   but they're gaining visceral fat
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:54.460]   because of the high cortisol and the stress.
[02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:57.440]   - So there's something about the adrenocorticoid receptors
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:00.640]   in that area that just preferentially depot fat there
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:02.380]   when cortisol is high?
[02:24:02.380 --> 02:24:03.880]   - Indeed.
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:07.760]   Because that's the metabolically active fat, right?
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:09.880]   And five pounds will do it.
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.160]   And then finally the third fat depot, the liver.
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:17.760]   Now, how many pounds of fat can the liver store
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:20.500]   before you become metabolically ill?
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:24.000]   - Oh, I gotta be even less
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.240]   because the liver's not nearly as large
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:28.840]   as the sort of abdominal region.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:31.160]   - Half a pound, quarter of a kilo.
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:33.820]   How much does a healthy liver weigh?
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:38.100]   - Healthy liver weighs 1,500 grams, okay?
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:43.160]   So it's not very--
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.740]   - I'm trying to translate quickly to pounds,
[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:47.040]   so we're going metric, we're going as standard to metric.
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:50.000]   - So 1,500 grams would be three pounds.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.860]   So basically half a pound, okay?
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.240]   So not very much.
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:58.980]   Because that's where the action is.
[02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:02.120]   And so when you have fat in your liver,
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:05.720]   it causes metabolic dysfunction right away.
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:08.700]   And the question is where did that fat come from?
[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:10.540]   That came from alcohol or sugar.
[02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:15.280]   So alcohol and sugar, most metabolically egregious
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:17.600]   'cause it affects the liver directly.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:22.600]   Stress, second most because it affects the visceral fat.
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:26.720]   And subcutaneous fat, the least important
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:29.040]   in terms of metabolic derangement.
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:32.140]   So yes, it may not look good in a bathing suit,
[02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:33.920]   but from a metabolic standpoint,
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:36.020]   it is actually the least important.
[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:39.740]   So the question then becomes, all right,
[02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:42.380]   what are you trying to fix?
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:46.280]   If you're trying to fix liver fat, it's really easy.
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:47.360]   Get rid of the alcohol and the sugar,
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:49.360]   except of course they're both addictive.
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:51.520]   - Will that also liberate any fat
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:52.680]   that's already in the liver?
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:54.000]   - Absolutely, and that's one of the reasons
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.080]   why intermittent fasting works
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.760]   is because it gives your liver a chance
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:02.720]   to basically offload what it's already stored.
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:05.320]   That's one of the things that intermittent fasting
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:10.080]   will buy you is a little less liver fat.
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:11.880]   So that's a good thing.
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:14.960]   All right, now stress on the other hand, as you know,
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.360]   and as we've talked about and as you know,
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:21.960]   you've had Dr. Les Appel on your podcast before,
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:25.120]   stress is tough, trying to mitigate stress,
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:27.080]   especially in today's environment,
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.140]   and I hope you'll invite me back some time
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:33.640]   to talk about the role of stress on the amygdala.
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:34.480]   - Yeah, gladly.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:39.200]   - And then finally, the subcutaneous fat.
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:44.200]   So when people go on diet sweeteners, what are they doing?
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:51.320]   Are they really reducing the fat?
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:53.600]   And the answer is no.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:55.460]   - When are you talking about artificial sweeteners?
[02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:57.120]   - Diet sweeteners of any sort.
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:59.320]   You can pick your artificial sweetener.
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.320]   So aspartame or sucralose, stevia, monk fruit,
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:08.400]   the new ones, you know.
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:10.640]   - Yeah, the one that people are more excited about nowadays
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:13.460]   is Allulose, it's expensive, it tends to have less
[02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:16.520]   of an artificial sweetener taste that people can detect.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:21.100]   So you're saying that regardless of, oh, and we should,
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:25.500]   I'm remembering from the comment section, I do read them,
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:29.860]   artificial sweeteners and non-caloric sweeteners.
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:31.500]   Because the moment you say artificial, people say,
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:33.180]   what about stevia, what about Allulose?
[02:27:33.180 --> 02:27:37.200]   So let's just say non-caloric sweeteners
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:40.100]   can wrap our arms around that entire category
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:42.460]   unless we need to distinguish among the different
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:44.140]   participants in that category.
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:48.460]   So you're saying that even though people can lower
[02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:50.960]   their total caloric intake, pretty effectively,
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:53.100]   I've seen the studies that show if, you know,
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:58.100]   dieters who consume water only as their main liquid
[02:27:58.100 --> 02:28:04.140]   versus diet sodas with aspartame typically or stevia,
[02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:08.340]   the diet soda drinkers actually lose more weight.
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:11.220]   We know that, but you're saying there may be deposition
[02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:14.820]   of fat in the liver in those individuals,
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:16.900]   specifically because of the artificial sweetener.
[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:18.460]   - Because of the insulin.
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:20.820]   Turns out there's still an insulin response.
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:24.540]   So a very famous study done in Copenhagen,
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:29.540]   100 normal individuals, 25 in four different groups.
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:35.680]   One group, one liter of sugared soda per day for six months.
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.520]   - One liter, that's a lot of sugared soda.
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:43.220]   - Yeah, one group, one liter of diet soda per day
[02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:44.180]   for six months.
[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:46.400]   - I probably did that in graduate school.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:50.180]   - One group, one liter of milk per day for six months.
[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:52.060]   - I probably did that when I was an infant.
[02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:54.220]   - And finally, one final group,
[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:56.540]   one liter of water per day for six months.
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:57.380]   - I do that now.
[02:28:57.380 --> 02:29:00.260]   I do more than that, but yeah.
[02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:04.540]   - The one liter of soda per day in six months
[02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:05.620]   gained 10 kilos.
[02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:06.540]   - The sugary soda.
[02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:07.380]   - The sugary soda.
[02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:08.380]   - 10 kilos.
[02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:10.540]   - 10 kilos, no surprise.
[02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:14.940]   The one liter of water per day lost two kilos.
[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:18.060]   Also no surprise, those were the easy ones.
[02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:20.340]   Now let's do the ones in the middle.
[02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:25.020]   One liter of milk per day, no change.
[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:26.660]   - Presumably that was full fat milk.
[02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:28.100]   We're talking about Europe.
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:28.940]   - Full fat milk.
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:31.100]   - Yeah, they like their full fat milk.
[02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:33.420]   - No change, why is that?
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:37.860]   They're taking on an enormous increase
[02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:39.580]   in total caloric intake.
[02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:42.860]   - I'm guessing that there was a blunted insulin response
[02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:44.460]   due to the fat in the milk.
[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:49.060]   - And also because lactose is not a very big driver
[02:29:49.060 --> 02:29:50.540]   of insulin response.
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:53.760]   And because there's a satiety effect.
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:54.600]   - That's like food.
[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:55.420]   - They eat less.
[02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:56.260]   - Yeah, it's like food.
[02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:57.880]   - Like food.
[02:29:57.880 --> 02:30:01.940]   And finally, the key, the kicker to the whole thing,
[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:04.880]   diet soda, the one liter of diet soda.
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:08.020]   What would you predict their weight would do?
[02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:09.940]   - More weight loss than in the water group
[02:30:09.940 --> 02:30:12.300]   based on my understanding of the literature.
[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:14.160]   - They gain two kilos.
[02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:16.040]   - A child, because they ate more.
[02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:21.900]   - Well, you tell me, why did they gain two kilos
[02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:24.600]   if they were consuming a liter of diet soda,
[02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:26.580]   which are zero calories?
[02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:28.340]   The answer is because they still generated
[02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:29.460]   an insulin response.
[02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:31.920]   - And that insulin response generated more hunger?
[02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:35.980]   - More weight and more hunger, exactly.
[02:30:35.980 --> 02:30:36.900]   And that's the key.
[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:40.620]   So they didn't gain the 10 kilos, they gained two kilos.
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:44.300]   So it looks better compared to the sugared version,
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:50.760]   but it looks like a problem compared to the water version
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:51.940]   or even the milk version.
[02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:54.740]   - So unless you bootstrap calories and hold that constant,
[02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:55.800]   you're gonna see a weight gain
[02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:57.620]   due to artificial sweetener intake.
[02:30:57.620 --> 02:30:58.460]   - Exactly right.
[02:30:58.460 --> 02:31:00.520]   And that's been shown 50 ways from Sunday
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:02.500]   at a whole bunch of different studies.
[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:06.000]   So compared to sugar, yeah, it's better.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.640]   But compared to water, it's way worse.
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:11.380]   And the reason is the insulin response.
[02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:13.080]   You put something sweet on the tongue,
[02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:15.720]   message goes, tongue to brain, sugar's coming,
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:19.040]   message goes, brain to pancreas through the vagus nerve,
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:22.040]   sugar's coming, release the insulin.
[02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:26.040]   And so tongue doesn't know if it's sugar or not.
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:28.600]   It releases the, the pancreas releases the insulin,
[02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:30.620]   which drives energy into fat,
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:34.300]   whether it was from the diet sweetener or not.
[02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:35.840]   - I saw some really interesting data
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.900]   from Dana Small's group at Yale
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:40.920]   showing that when people have a diet soda with food,
[02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:42.720]   so this is like the Diet Coke with the sandwich
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:45.620]   or with the burger, maybe even with the pasta,
[02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:48.000]   the insulin response from the food
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.840]   and the insulin response from the diet soda are compounded,
[02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:52.440]   but there's a classical conditioning effect,
[02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:56.040]   Pavlovian effect, such that then later,
[02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:58.640]   if they just drink the diet soda,
[02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:00.760]   they get an even bigger insulin response
[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:03.800]   just to the diet soda than they would have originally
[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:06.240]   if they'd only had the diet soda separate from food.
[02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:08.120]   So in other words, the insulin,
[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:09.980]   the food-induced insulin response
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:12.200]   is conditioning a greater insulin response
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:13.220]   from the diet soda.
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:14.640]   - And we actually have another study
[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:17.620]   that demonstrates the same thing out of Singapore,
[02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:21.540]   Tay et al in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,
[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:26.540]   2018, I believe, that looked at a similar paradigm.
[02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:28.620]   Here's what they did.
[02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:31.860]   They took a bunch of people and they admitted them
[02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:35.540]   to their clinical research center four times a week apart,
[02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:37.400]   and they did them in random order.
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:42.400]   And each time they started the morning, they're fasting,
[02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:46.640]   and they did either a sucrose tolerance test
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:51.640]   or an aspartame tolerance test or a sucralose tolerance test
[02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:55.960]   or a monk fruit tolerance test.
[02:32:55.960 --> 02:33:00.960]   So two hours, ingesting one of the four
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:03.500]   and measuring glucose and insulin
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:05.360]   over the course of the next two hours.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:06.340]   - Fasted.
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:07.820]   - Fasted, okay.
[02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:10.360]   Then it was time for lunch,
[02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:13.060]   and they let them have whatever lunch they want.
[02:33:13.060 --> 02:33:14.980]   It was a metabolic buffet.
[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:17.520]   They could eat whatever they wanted off the buffet
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:21.600]   except that they were being clocked,
[02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:23.180]   and the same for dinner.
[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:24.380]   They were being clocked,
[02:33:24.380 --> 02:33:25.640]   but they could eat whatever they wanted.
[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:26.700]   - In a given period of time.
[02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:30.860]   - In the 24 hours, or from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:32.740]   whenever they went home.
[02:33:32.740 --> 02:33:35.960]   Turned out the sucrose tolerance test
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:38.960]   generated an insulin response as you'd expect.
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:43.960]   The monk fruit, the sucralose, and the aspartame did not.
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:49.320]   But then when they ate lunch,
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:53.460]   if they had had one of the three diet sweeteners
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:57.600]   in the morning, they ate more at lunch and more at dinner
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:00.120]   and generated an increased insulin response
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:01.160]   both at lunch and dinner
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:03.360]   so that the area under the curve for the whole day
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:05.060]   was exactly the same.
[02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:07.920]   - So they ate significantly more.
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:11.980]   - Yeah, yeah, because they had the diet soda in the morning.
[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:17.960]   - Wild, well I drink drinks that contain stevia,
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:20.460]   and I don't worry about it too much,
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:25.300]   but what you're saying is even if I bootstrap my calories,
[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:27.280]   there's a possibility that the insulin response
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:29.600]   could have direct effects on the liver.
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.440]   - Exactly right.
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:31.320]   - And not for the better.
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:32.360]   - And not for the better.
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:33.820]   Now, having said that,
[02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:39.380]   we have undertaken an interesting project,
[02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:41.280]   which I don't know if you know about.
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:46.000]   In 2020, during the pandemic,
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.420]   I was approached by a food company in the Middle East
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:54.000]   called Kuwaiti Danish Dairy Company, KDD.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.040]   It's the Nestle of the Middle East.
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:58.040]   Now they make all sorts of junk.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:03.360]   Frozen yogurt, flavored milks, ice cream,
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:06.720]   confectionery, biscuits, tomato sauce, okay?
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:14.280]   Kuwait has an 18% diabetes rate and an 80% obesity rate.
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:16.960]   - Eight zero. - Eight zero.
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:19.240]   - Wow. - In the adults, all right?
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:24.680]   Now, the company recognized that they wanted
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:27.600]   to be a metabolically healthy company
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:28.900]   and they knew they weren't.
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:31.660]   They contacted me and said,
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:34.280]   would you put together a scientific advisory team
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:39.280]   to advise us what we need to do to change the food
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.220]   in order to be a metabolically healthy company?
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:43.360]   And we wanna lead.
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.760]   And I said, I'd be happy to do that with one proviso.
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:50.800]   We get to publish what we did
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:53.200]   so that it can serve as a roadmap
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.080]   for the rest of the food industry.
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:56.560]   And they said, fine.
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:59.840]   And so I convened a scientific advisory team
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:01.840]   with my colleague, Wolfram Alderson,
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:05.680]   who started the very first farmer's market in Los Angeles
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:06.880]   and is now actually the director
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:08.920]   of sustainability and nutrition for KDD.
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:13.280]   Tim Harlan, who is the head of culinary medicine
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:15.480]   at George Washington University.
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:18.040]   Rachel Gao, who is a fatty acid expert
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.920]   who ran the omega-3 for ADD trial at the NIH.
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:23.160]   And Andreas Kornstadt,
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:25.920]   who's actually a computer scientist from Stanford.
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:31.280]   And we basically stripped down every single thing
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:36.640]   that KDD did in terms of procurement,
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.560]   in terms of ingredients, in terms of packaging.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.480]   We submitted every single ingredient
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:44.440]   to biochemical analysis because you couldn't trust
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:47.720]   what the vendors were basically telling KDD
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:48.760]   was in the food.
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:51.480]   We had to actually know what was in the food.
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:53.820]   And that was a half a million dollars all by itself.
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.820]   I mean, this was not a cheap little sojourn into the woods.
[02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:00.080]   This was a big deal.
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:05.080]   We basically re-engineered their entire 180 item portfolio.
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:10.260]   And they have now turned over 10% of their products
[02:37:10.260 --> 02:37:12.300]   to be metabolically healthy.
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:17.820]   And the precepts that we set in this paper,
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.640]   which is in Frontiers in Nutrition
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:22.720]   in March of this year, 2023,
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:24.440]   three things, three principles.
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:26.200]   If you adhere to these three principles,
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:29.440]   you can turn any food healthy,
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:31.460]   including ultra-processed food.
[02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:34.660]   Number one, protect the liver.
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:36.720]   Number two, feed the gut.
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:38.600]   Number three, support the brain.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:43.200]   If you have a food that does all three of those,
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:44.700]   it is healthy.
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:47.240]   If you have a food that does none of those three,
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:49.020]   then it's poison because it's not food.
[02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:50.060]   - It's not, I was gonna say,
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:53.560]   it doesn't sound like food is the right descriptor
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:54.400]   in that case.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:55.220]   - Exactly.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:37:57.280]   And if it does one or two but not all three,
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:59.180]   then it's gonna be somewhere in between.
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.640]   So the goal was to take all of KDD's products
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:06.600]   and move them from the lowest tier up to the highest tier
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:09.740]   by adhering to these three principles.
[02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:12.940]   And we came up with some very simple things.
[02:38:12.940 --> 02:38:15.520]   Number one, gotta get rid of the sugar.
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:19.220]   Number two, gotta add fiber.
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:21.940]   Number three, gotta add omega-3s.
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:26.000]   Number four, gotta do something about the emulsifiers
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.400]   because the emulsifiers are causing the gut inflammation
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.920]   because after all, emulsifiers are detergents.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:33.240]   They hold fat and water together.
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:35.300]   They burn a hole in the mucin layer.
[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:38.200]   So they're actually contributing to that gut inflammation
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.080]   and emulsifiers are strewn throughout
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:43.120]   ultra-processed food-dom.
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:46.200]   - We've heard about hidden sugars a lot
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:47.820]   during today's episode and elsewhere,
[02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:51.760]   but based on everything you told us about artificial,
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:53.940]   excuse me, low-calorie sweeteners,
[02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:57.080]   it makes more sense to me now
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:00.280]   why foods that are not touted as diet foods
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:02.500]   would be laced with things like sucralose
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:05.780]   because it should drive the craving for that food
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:09.540]   through increases in insulin and craving of other foods
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:11.460]   later that day and later that evening.
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:14.980]   Is that why non-caloric sweeteners
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:17.120]   are added to all sorts of foods now
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.840]   that because typically one thing's non-caloric sweeteners
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:22.280]   probably only added to quote-unquote diet foods,
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:24.520]   low-calorie foods, but that's not--
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:26.660]   - You're right, that's not the case.
[02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:30.020]   And they are adding diet sweeteners to foods
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:31.960]   that you didn't know had diet sweeteners in them.
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:32.800]   That's right.
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:36.180]   There are two reasons that this happens.
[02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:39.320]   One is insulin because insulin blocks leptin signaling
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:43.120]   at the level of the hypothalamus and the nucleus accumbens.
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:44.760]   So if it blocks leptin,
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:47.240]   leptin is the hormone that your fat cells make
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:49.480]   that tells your brain you've had enough.
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.300]   So if insulin blocks leptin, it makes you hungrier
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:55.440]   and it also extinguishes,
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:58.700]   it stops the extinguishing of reward by that food
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.520]   so that you want more of it.
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:03.520]   So it does both because leptin normally
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:08.100]   suppresses food intake and reduces craving.
[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:12.180]   - The analogy that comes to mind is a slot machine
[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:15.300]   that encourages you to feed more money
[02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:17.660]   and hit go to pull the lever,
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:19.900]   but that also blinds you to the outcome.
[02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:22.660]   So even if you win, you don't even know that you have wins.
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:24.580]   It's also blinding you to your losses.
[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:27.460]   You're effectively becoming an automaton
[02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:32.460]   of just eating without any kind of conscious understanding
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:35.920]   of what you're bringing in or tasting the food any longer.
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:36.760]   - Exactly.
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:37.860]   - Right, it's not this like,
[02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:39.740]   Anna Lemke when she came on the podcast,
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:40.980]   author of "Dopamine Nation"
[02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:43.940]   and obviously head of our dual diagnosis addiction clinic
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:48.940]   at Stanford, talked about these consumptive behaviors
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:52.420]   where people are scrolling social media or consuming porn
[02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:55.560]   or consuming drugs or alcohol in a way that like,
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:57.520]   they're not in touch with the pleasure
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:59.980]   of the substance or behavior anymore.
[02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:01.520]   They become automatons.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:04.500]   But if they don't do it, they feel lousy.
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:07.140]   So the pleasure is gone, the pain is definitely awaiting.
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:08.840]   - Tolerance and dependence,
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:10.960]   that's the definition of addiction.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:14.620]   So dopamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter.
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:16.940]   It excites the next neuron always.
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:19.980]   There is no such thing as dopamine inhibiting
[02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:21.500]   a post-synaptic neuron.
[02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:23.880]   Dopamine stimulates the next neuron.
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:26.000]   And it doesn't matter which dopamine receptor it is,
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.980]   one through five, it's always excitatory.
[02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:30.780]   Now, neurons like to be excited.
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.700]   That's why they have receptors.
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:35.680]   But neurons like to be tickled, not bludgeoned.
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:39.780]   Chronic overstimulation of any neuron, and you know this,
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:41.920]   leads to neuronal cell death.
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:46.260]   And the reason is because the neuron needs energy.
[02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:51.260]   The neuron is the most energy-dependent tissue in the body.
[02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:57.080]   It needs those mitochondria to be pumping out ATP
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:00.700]   like crazy to engage in neurotransmission.
[02:42:00.700 --> 02:42:05.700]   Well, when you're firing nonstop, you risk cell death.
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:11.740]   So the excitatory neuron, the post-synaptic neuron,
[02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:14.180]   has a plan B.
[02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:16.900]   It down-regulates the receptor.
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:19.060]   It down-regulates the dopamine receptor.
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:22.540]   So there's less chance that any stray dopamine molecule
[02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:24.760]   will find a receptor to bind to.
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:28.940]   And this is its plan B in order to try to mitigate
[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:30.000]   the risk of dying.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.660]   Well, what does that mean in human terms?
[02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:36.420]   It means you get a hit, you get a rush,
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:39.260]   receptors go down, next time you need a bigger hit
[02:42:39.260 --> 02:42:41.860]   to get the same rush, and receptors go down,
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:43.540]   and you need a bigger hit and a bigger hit and a bigger hit
[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:46.300]   until finally you need a huge hit to get nothing.
[02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:48.100]   That's called tolerance.
[02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:51.060]   And then when the neurons do start to die,
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:52.260]   that's called addiction.
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:55.660]   That's what we've got.
[02:42:55.660 --> 02:42:59.180]   And that's what's happened in terms of food addiction.
[02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:02.740]   So the question is, what's addictive?
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:04.820]   Is fat addictive?
[02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:07.080]   No, because if fat was addictive,
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:09.780]   then all the people on the Atkins diet
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:11.520]   or on the ketogenic diet would be gaining weight,
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:12.360]   not losing it.
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:14.340]   - And I'd be craving rib-eyes all day.
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:16.460]   I like a rib-eye pretty often, actually.
[02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:18.300]   But I know, I know, people say no.
[02:43:18.300 --> 02:43:20.580]   But hey, look, my lipids are in line
[02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:23.540]   and I don't eat many starches and I certainly avoid sugar.
[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:25.920]   Although now I'm thinking I might want to really reduce
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:29.260]   my low-calorie sweetener intake.
[02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:32.700]   I don't see myself reducing my stevia intake to zero
[02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:34.440]   'cause it's in some things I really like.
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:37.620]   - Andrew, I am not the food police, you know?
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:39.780]   - I always say that to people, I'm not a cop.
[02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:44.780]   But data are data and health data are interesting.
[02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:48.620]   - The data say that that's not helping you any.
[02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:50.000]   That's what the data say.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.720]   Point is that the fat's not the problem.
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:58.380]   The salt's not the problem.
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:00.260]   The caffeine's a problem.
[02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:01.100]   - Really?
[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:04.880]   - It's a classic addictive substance at every level.
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:06.640]   - Yeah, but in terms of-- - And the sugar's a problem.
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.280]   - But if one can cut out caffeine by the early afternoon
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:13.520]   or even sooner in the day and it's not consumed to excess
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:17.920]   and it's in the form of coffee, yerba mate,
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:19.600]   some other form that's healthy,
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:23.480]   is it really that much of a problem?
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.440]   I love coffee and yerba mate. - Me too.
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:26.260]   That's my addiction.
[02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:30.520]   - Like with a capital L underlined boldface highlight.
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:33.500]   - I feel your pain.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:38.360]   And the answer is no one has shown that coffee is toxic.
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:40.560]   It is addictive, but it's not toxic.
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:42.660]   Now, if you mix the coffee with alcohol,
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:44.980]   now you got four loco, now it's toxic.
[02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:49.200]   But in and of itself, caffeine is not toxic.
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:51.640]   And that's why there's a Starbucks on every street corner.
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:53.060]   - But it is highly reinforcing.
[02:44:53.060 --> 02:44:55.960]   I did an episode on caffeine where it covered some data
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:57.560]   that was published in the journal Science,
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:59.060]   one of the three apex journals.
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:04.360]   And if you put caffeine, unbeknownst to the consumer,
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:09.000]   into plain yogurt, people will crave plain yogurt much more.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.160]   I mean, people like the feeling of being caffeine
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.160]   as long as it's not creating anxiety levels of energy.
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:15.000]   - Exactly.
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.180]   - I'm gonna stick with caffeine.
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:18.520]   - That's fine, and so will I.
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:20.660]   - We've been talking a little bit about the hypothalamus
[02:45:20.660 --> 02:45:23.640]   as well as some peripheral gut-based mechanisms
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:25.580]   for hunger and satiety.
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:28.440]   This is a great opportunity to talk about
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:33.440]   some of the GLP-1 agonists that are now widely used.
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:35.560]   So typically called ozempic,
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:39.040]   but GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1,
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:41.300]   originally discovered in the Gila monster,
[02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:42.320]   which eats very seldom.
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:45.360]   And some really smart biologist, I love biology like this,
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:46.680]   said, "How come they don't have to eat very much?"
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:49.720]   Well, their blood is loaded with GLP-1.
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:50.560]   - Right.
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.320]   - And so they only have to eat one,
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:55.560]   whatever Gila monsters delight in,
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:57.560]   per year or something outrageous like that.
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:45:59.240]   Humans make GLP-1 as well.
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:00.960]   My understanding is that GLP-1,
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.060]   not that it's injected, but that one makes naturally,
[02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:10.200]   is acting on both the brain and the gut
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:11.720]   to increase satiety.
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:16.400]   - So it is acting on the brain, no argument,
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:19.320]   but the primary action is on the gut.
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:25.160]   GLP-1 decreases the rate of gastric emptying.
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:28.840]   - That is its primary driver.
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:30.320]   Yes, it does affect the brain.
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:31.680]   I'm not arguing that it does,
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:34.880]   but the primary effect is to reduce
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:36.160]   the rate of gastric emptying.
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:41.160]   So you stay fuller longer because the food doesn't move
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:43.360]   through the stomach and the intestine.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:46.080]   - Interesting, in South America, in Uruguay and Argentina,
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:50.200]   it was long thought that yerba mate consumption,
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:53.720]   which we know very modestly increases GLP-1,
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:56.700]   and by the way, a lot of other things do too,
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:59.120]   that people were taking it after meals
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:01.000]   for its laxative effect, partially,
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.040]   but that's, you know, it's not pleasant for-
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:05.040]   - But that's also at the colon.
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:06.200]   - That's at the level of the colon.
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:07.040]   - Rather than the stomach.
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:09.320]   - But it is used fairly effectively
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:11.800]   for people to space their meals without snacking.
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:15.500]   And maybe it's the GLP-1, maybe it's something else,
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:16.920]   but people are injecting themselves
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:19.960]   with GLP-1 analogs now.
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:21.800]   - And it's $1,300 a month, yeah.
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:22.640]   - Is that what it costs?
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:24.280]   - That's what it costs right now.
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:26.060]   - And it seems to be pretty effective
[02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:28.400]   at inducing weight loss, although a significant amount
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:29.320]   of that weight loss seems to be
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:31.600]   from skeletal muscle tissue.
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:33.040]   - And we need to talk about that.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:36.200]   - So what are your thoughts on ozempic as a primary,
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.260]   earlier you talked about primary and secondary control.
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:40.600]   You referred to it a little bit differently
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:42.040]   in the context of statins.
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:46.120]   So a kid comes in who's obese, who's slightly overweight,
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:47.620]   and it's like, "Mm, I don't know what to do.
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:49.080]   "I'm trying to eat better exercise."
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:50.120]   Or a person comes in and says,
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:52.100]   "Hey, I've had a really hard time getting
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:56.260]   "that last 29 pounds off for so many years.
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:47:57.760]   "Will you prescribe me ozempic?"
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:00.900]   - So the short answer is number one, I'm retired,
[02:48:00.900 --> 02:48:02.640]   so I'm not prescribed on anything.
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:05.280]   But let's go there.
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:11.140]   The data show that GLP-1 analogs like semaglutide
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:16.600]   and now terzepatide, which is Lily's version,
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:18.560]   Monjaro is the diabetes version,
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:21.600]   Zepbound is the obesity version in the same way
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:26.180]   that Ozempic is the diabetes version for Novo Nordisk
[02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:28.660]   and Wegovy is the obesity version.
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:29.880]   - But they're all GLP-1 analogs.
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:31.360]   - They're all GLP-1 analogs.
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:32.540]   - They're synthesized in a lab.
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:34.460]   It looks like GLP-1, smells like GLP-1,
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:36.340]   acts like GLP-1 when injected.
[02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:40.900]   - Terzepatide, the Lily one, actually has a dual function.
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:45.900]   It binds to the GIP receptor, so it might have double duty.
[02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:50.280]   And the data show that it's actually even slightly
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:53.600]   more effective at weight loss than the Novo Nordisk version.
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:55.960]   So we'll be seeing a shift in terms
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:59.940]   of consumer preference soon, no doubt.
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:02.900]   But here's the thing.
[02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:07.900]   You look at the data, one year of treatment,
[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:10.320]   16% weight loss.
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.840]   Now that sounds great.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:12.840]   And I'm not saying it's bad.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:13.680]   It's good.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:14.680]   - And people are not craving food all the time.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.520]   Is that because people are feeling full longer?
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:19.360]   - Right.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:20.180]   - So they're eating less.
[02:49:20.180 --> 02:49:21.200]   - They're eating less.
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:23.180]   - This is the calorie in, calorie out model.
[02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:24.500]   - They're eating less.
[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:26.440]   And so they are losing weight.
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:27.480]   I'm not arguing that.
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:29.080]   - And they might be craving alcohol less,
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.000]   according to some recent reports.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:30.960]   - Yes, yeah.
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:34.240]   Well, we can go there for a minute too, in a second.
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:36.940]   Here's the problem.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:38.840]   When you look at that 16% weight loss,
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:42.440]   as you just said, when you put people in a DEXA scanner,
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:45.960]   they have lost equal amounts of fat and muscle.
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:49.180]   Now, is it good to lose muscle?
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:50.020]   No.
[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:50.880]   It is not good.
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:52.720]   Ask any little old lady who breaks her hip
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:54.760]   if she wishes she had a little bit more muscle.
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.720]   - Or somebody who dieted lost a lot of muscle
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:58.260]   'cause they weren't offsetting the weight loss
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:01.060]   with resistance training or some other form of exercise.
[02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:03.600]   And the amount of food that they can eat
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:05.520]   in order to maintain that weight,
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:08.360]   to put it in scientific terms, sucks.
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:12.360]   - And we mentioned Peter Atiyah earlier.
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:14.320]   In Outlive, he's made it very clear
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:17.600]   that sarcopenia, lack of muscle mass,
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:20.200]   is one of the drivers of mortality.
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:25.200]   So losing muscle is not a good idea.
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:29.260]   But you lose equal amounts of fat and muscle.
[02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:31.820]   What else causes loss of equal amounts
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:32.940]   of fat and muscle?
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:34.380]   Starvation.
[02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:38.620]   In fact, the reason that all these GLP-1 analogs work
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:40.020]   is because you stop eating.
[02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:41.300]   - Like the Gila monster. - It's starvation.
[02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:42.140]   Yeah, just like the Gila monster.
[02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:44.300]   - Although the Gila monsters look pretty chubby to me.
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:48.000]   - Well, ask another Gila monster.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.640]   - I did, but unfortunately whatever answer it provided
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.440]   was not interpretable. - Indeed.
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:56.280]   The point is that starvation is not so good.
[02:50:56.280 --> 02:51:00.040]   And if you think about why it's working,
[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:04.320]   it's reducing the rate of gastric emptying, all right?
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:07.160]   Well, it turns out that that's the reason
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.520]   for its side effects, the reduction in gastric emptying.
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:11.880]   That's why you get nausea.
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:13.520]   That's why you get vomiting.
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:16.260]   That's why you get pancreatitis.
[02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:20.700]   And most importantly now, gastroparesis.
[02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:23.520]   Your stomach turns to stone.
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:29.480]   And you can't move any food through your intestine at all.
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:33.680]   And worse yet, when you stop the medicine,
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:36.080]   the gastroparesis doesn't get better.
[02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:38.080]   This is not a good idea.
[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:39.000]   - This is like the opposite
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:40.520]   of the Yerba Monte induced effect,
[02:51:40.520 --> 02:51:42.740]   which has a sort of prolaxative gastric emptying,
[02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:44.840]   maybe GLP-1 agonism.
[02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:45.840]   Gosh, okay.
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:48.820]   So it's obvious why people
[02:51:48.820 --> 02:51:51.180]   who've struggled to lose weight like it,
[02:51:51.180 --> 02:51:53.280]   especially if their struggle to lose weight was,
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:54.120]   at least in their mind,
[02:51:54.120 --> 02:51:56.020]   the consequence of being hungry all the time
[02:51:56.020 --> 02:51:57.560]   and needing to eat more.
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:02.420]   - Or was it because of the reward and their dependence?
[02:52:02.420 --> 02:52:07.420]   Because in fact, yes, these GLP-1 analogs reduce reward.
[02:52:07.420 --> 02:52:12.240]   And that's one of the reasons why they've noticed
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:17.240]   that reduction in alcohol consumption as well.
[02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:20.220]   And that sounds like a good thing,
[02:52:20.220 --> 02:52:25.220]   except there are also numerous cases now
[02:52:25.220 --> 02:52:28.880]   of major depressive disorder in response to these drugs.
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:30.660]   - It's almost like naltrexone or something
[02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:32.060]   for the treatment of addiction,
[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:33.360]   which sometimes can be useful,
[02:52:33.360 --> 02:52:37.360]   but attempting to remove the amplitude
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:39.820]   of that reward signal.
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:41.660]   I mean, on paper it makes sense,
[02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:43.100]   but it doesn't always play out.
[02:52:43.100 --> 02:52:45.220]   - And in practice it doesn't play out, that's right.
[02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:50.220]   And so I'm gonna refer you now to an old literature
[02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:53.220]   that was from 2006.
[02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:57.540]   There was a drug that was approved in Europe
[02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:02.540]   called Romanabant, okay, a trade name Acomplia.
[02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:06.160]   And it was approved in Europe for weight loss.
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:07.820]   And it was pretty good at weight loss.
[02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:10.480]   It caused about 20% weight loss.
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:15.060]   It also caused severe depression and 21 suicides.
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:16.260]   - So it's no longer available.
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:19.700]   - Because it was pulled from the European market,
[02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:22.020]   never approved in the United States.
[02:53:22.020 --> 02:53:23.100]   And the reason this happened
[02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:26.260]   was because this was the anti-marijuana drug.
[02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:28.420]   This was the anti-munchies drug.
[02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:32.220]   This was an endocannabinoid antagonist.
[02:53:32.220 --> 02:53:34.940]   Well, when you reduce reward,
[02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:37.160]   you also reduce your desire to live.
[02:53:38.060 --> 02:53:41.240]   And that's why this concern about reduction
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:42.400]   in alcohol consumption,
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:45.320]   we've already seen major depressive disorder
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:48.440]   in patients receiving Ozempic.
[02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:51.020]   So are we gonna see the same thing play out
[02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:52.840]   as we did for Romanabant?
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:53.920]   I'm worried about it.
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:54.940]   - Or Fen-Fen.
[02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:56.600]   - Well, Fen-Fen didn't have--
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:58.520]   - No, it was cardiac.
[02:53:58.520 --> 02:53:59.440]   - It was cardiac, right.
[02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:02.820]   We had cardiac problems due to the fenfluramine
[02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:06.620]   because of the serotonin 1B receptor agonism.
[02:54:06.620 --> 02:54:07.760]   - Right, I'm just referring to the fact
[02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:11.300]   that these quote-unquote blockbuster drugs for obesity,
[02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:14.640]   they tend to follow a contour of very promising,
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:18.220]   very exciting, a lot of people losing weight suicides,
[02:54:18.220 --> 02:54:20.720]   or very promising, a lot of people losing weight,
[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:23.760]   cardiac issues, very promising, losing weight.
[02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:25.960]   And now you're saying the stomach turns to stone.
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:27.520]   It sounds so biblical.
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:28.760]   - Well, indeed.
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:29.760]   So that's the question.
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:33.460]   And then finally, we can really talk biblical.
[02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:37.520]   If everyone in America who qualified for Ozempic
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:42.420]   got it, that would be 2.1 trillion to the healthcare system,
[02:54:42.420 --> 02:54:44.400]   which is currently at 4.1 trillion.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.900]   So that would be a greater than 50% increase
[02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:51.120]   in healthcare costs at 1,300 a month.
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:57.480]   Conversely, if we just got sugar consumption
[02:54:57.480 --> 02:55:02.480]   down to USDA guidelines by basically putting some limits
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:06.440]   on how much added sugar the food industry can put
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:08.480]   into any given product, like Froot Loops,
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:14.440]   we could reduce weight by 29% and save $3.0 trillion.
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:23.260]   So we'd get better weight loss and we'd save $5.1 trillion,
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:28.660]   which makes more sense to the U.S. government.
[02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:31.600]   - Well, earlier you were alluding to government,
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:34.760]   big food, big pharma relationships.
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:36.520]   I mean, there's a huge win here
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:39.800]   for whoever's manufacturing these GLP-1 analogs.
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:41.000]   - Indeed.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:42.720]   - But the question is, who's paying the tab?
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:43.560]   - Well, we are.
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:47.720]   Now, the question is, why can't the government see that?
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:50.680]   And the answer is because the government's on the dole too.
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:55.680]   Because the government, through tariffs on U.S.-made foods,
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:01.620]   okay, grosses $56 billion a year.
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:05.120]   So they're a player.
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.280]   They're not just a regulator, they're an actor.
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:10.200]   - To play devil's advocate a little bit,
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:11.880]   listen, I'm gonna be the last person to step in
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:15.800]   and try and defend government as a unified body.
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:18.700]   I'm not qualified to do that, but you could see how
[02:56:18.700 --> 02:56:21.980]   if you looked at it like checkers instead of chess,
[02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:25.160]   you'd say, okay, here's a drug that's going to allow
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:29.480]   many millions of people to reduce their overall body weight.
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:32.460]   Overall body weight is a risk factor for a number of things.
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:35.800]   And there will be savings on the back end
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:37.500]   as a consequence of that weight loss.
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:39.740]   I mean, so that's the checkers version.
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:42.060]   The chess version is how you're describing it.
[02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:47.060]   And I think that, I mean, clearly people in government
[02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:50.980]   are, well, most, some perhaps are smart enough
[02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:53.720]   to play chess, not checkers, or to at least understand it,
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:56.460]   but there's very little incentive for the chess model.
[02:56:56.460 --> 02:57:00.640]   So what would quote unquote solve this problem
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:02.180]   is the same thing that happened to Fen-Fen
[02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:07.180]   or this romantic, which is if suddenly there's a major issue
[02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:09.620]   with the drug, then everyone stops taking it.
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:10.880]   And traditionally that's how it's gone.
[02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:12.980]   It sounds like these GLP-1 analogs
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:14.700]   are gonna make it through the chute though.
[02:57:14.700 --> 02:57:19.700]   - Yeah, I mean, there is a very clear downside
[02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:21.380]   to these medicines.
[02:57:21.380 --> 02:57:24.260]   On the other hand, you know, there's an upside.
[02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:28.960]   And so I'm not sad that these medicines exist.
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:31.480]   I'm for them, I'm not against them.
[02:57:32.260 --> 02:57:34.360]   I'm for them for the right patient.
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:37.400]   And right now it's not the right patient who's getting them.
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:38.520]   - Just like the statins.
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:41.380]   So what if somebody who's taking one of these analogs
[02:57:41.380 --> 02:57:43.800]   makes it a point to do resistance training?
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:45.960]   And here, you know, you mentioned bodybuilders early.
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:47.880]   I'm not suggesting they become bodybuilders,
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:50.360]   but we now know, and I think Peter or Atiya and others
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:53.280]   would agree that everybody should be doing some form
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:56.400]   of muscle loss offsetting resistance exercise.
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:57.240]   - I agree.
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:58.160]   - At least past, you know,
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:00.440]   they're reaching their adult height or something.
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:01.960]   You know, I know there are those that say
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:03.560]   weight training doesn't blunt your height,
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:07.760]   but anyway, let's just say that from early twenties onward,
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:08.600]   doing something.
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:11.040]   - Especially if you're on these medicines
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:13.160]   in order to maintain muscle mass.
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:15.300]   - So that's a different picture, right?
[02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:16.840]   People are drinking less alcohol.
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:19.380]   Again, I'm playing devil's advocate here.
[02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:22.380]   So if we look at these compounds, not in a vacuum,
[02:58:22.380 --> 02:58:25.460]   but okay, the person who's been carrying that extra 30 pounds
[02:58:25.460 --> 02:58:29.280]   is now only carrying a few extra pounds of adipose tissue.
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:31.300]   They've lost a lot of muscle,
[02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:33.400]   but now they feel well enough to exercise.
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:36.180]   The depression part worries me,
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:38.960]   but anyway, I'm just trying to round the contour of it.
[02:58:38.960 --> 02:58:42.040]   - What we've seen in children,
[02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:43.880]   'cause that's who I took care of,
[02:58:43.880 --> 02:58:47.700]   was that often they needed a jumpstart, okay?
[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:50.240]   And there were different ways to get them to jumpstart.
[02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:51.280]   - Stomach stapling.
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:52.760]   - Well, that's not jumpstart.
[02:58:52.760 --> 02:58:53.760]   That's way down the line. - But that was what
[02:58:53.760 --> 02:58:54.880]   a lot of people did.
[02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:59.200]   I have a friend, he was and sadly still is really big.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:00.980]   And he always talked about the stomach stapling,
[02:59:00.980 --> 02:59:04.960]   like if I could just get 50 pounds down quickly,
[02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:07.680]   then I could exercise, but exercise is painful,
[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:08.520]   this kind of thing.
[02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:11.140]   And sadly, he's continued to maintain or creep up
[02:59:11.140 --> 02:59:12.600]   in a very excessive weight.
[02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:16.800]   - And that's the point, is that this concept of jumpstart,
[02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:20.040]   actually, if you're only doing it yourself,
[02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:21.120]   doesn't really work.
[02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:24.360]   And the question is, why is his weight creeping up
[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:25.760]   if he's had the stomach stapling?
[02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:28.840]   The answer is 'cause he's a sugar addict.
[02:59:28.840 --> 02:59:30.160]   - Yeah, he's definitely addicted
[02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:32.840]   to the super big gulp soda.
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:35.040]   - If you drink your calories,
[02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:37.280]   it doesn't really matter, does it?
[02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:39.600]   - No, and he's got such terrible psoriasis
[02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:41.000]   and joint pain and all this,
[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.440]   that the prospect of exercising is like a,
[02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:45.800]   you might as well tell him to like flap his wings
[02:59:45.800 --> 02:59:46.920]   and go to Mars.
[02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:50.140]   - You know, fructose is a driver of immune dysfunction.
[02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:53.040]   If he got off, you can tell him from me,
[02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:56.080]   if he got off the sugar, his psoriasis would get better,
[02:59:56.080 --> 02:59:59.080]   his weight would get better, his arthritis would get better,
[02:59:59.080 --> 03:00:02.360]   and he could have then that jumpstart.
[03:00:02.360 --> 03:00:04.180]   - This is a perfect example to bridge
[03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:05.880]   to the brain component of all this,
[03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:07.820]   because I've long wondered,
[03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:10.240]   based on what I understand about neural circuitry
[03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:13.640]   and neuroplasticity, I know we share in this knowledge
[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:17.560]   that at some point, carrying a lot of adipose tissue
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:19.680]   means that the brain sort of represents
[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:20.860]   the body differently.
[03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:24.640]   I mean, we know there are these somatotopic maps of self,
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:28.760]   but that the neural machinery and the hypothalamus, sure,
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:31.640]   which is responsible for motivated states, et cetera,
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:36.640]   but also just the entire mapping of the self changes.
[03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:39.860]   In other words, if one is fat long enough,
[03:00:39.860 --> 03:00:45.760]   that it becomes increasingly hard to get to a healthy weight
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:49.660]   because of the way that the neural circuitry is impacted.
[03:00:49.660 --> 03:00:53.600]   It basically remaps to maintain that fat person,
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:56.280]   not necessarily even just at the level of appetite,
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:00:58.860]   but just in terms of what do big animals do?
[03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:01.800]   I had a bulldog that weighed 90 pounds, bulldog mastiff.
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:04.440]   He was very economical with his movement, right?
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:05.800]   He was extremely powerful. - Indeed.
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:07.920]   - He could run, at least when he was younger,
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.640]   but if he could be still, he was still,
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:13.320]   as opposed to certain smaller animals
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:14.920]   that are peripatetic, right?
[03:01:14.920 --> 03:01:18.080]   - Because he was leptin resistant.
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:21.600]   So leptin, as we talked about briefly,
[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:25.600]   is the hormone that tells your brain you've had enough.
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:30.060]   If you are leptin sensitive, you are happy to burn.
[03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:31.360]   If you are leptin resistant,
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.080]   your brain thinks you're starving,
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:34.480]   and if your brain thinks you're starving,
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:37.280]   it's going to affect your behavior in two ways.
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:38.680]   It's gonna make you wanna eat,
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:41.080]   and it's also gonna make you wanna conserve
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:45.080]   because the goal is to try to increase the leptin levels
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:46.860]   in order to overcome that resistance,
[03:01:46.860 --> 03:01:49.000]   which, of course, you can never do
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:50.680]   because all you're gonna do is lay down more fat
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:51.740]   and make more leptin.
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:52.580]   - That makes so much sense
[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:54.240]   because leptin comes from the adipose tissue.
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:55.080]   - Exactly.
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:58.160]   So that leptin resistance
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:01.800]   is what you have to be able to break through.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:03.800]   You have to fix the leptin sensitivity.
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:07.000]   Well, what's the driver of the leptin resistance?
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:08.620]   Insulin.
[03:02:08.620 --> 03:02:12.080]   Insulin inhibits leptin signaling,
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:16.060]   and it does it at three separate places in the POMC neuron,
[03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:19.480]   the pro-opium melanocortin neuron in the hypothalamus.
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:24.040]   It does it at IRS2, insulin receptor substrate two.
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:27.080]   It does it at SOX3, suppressor of cytokine signaling three,
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:32.080]   and it does it at PIP3, phosphatidylinostole triphosphate.
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:37.120]   Those three separate arms of the leptin receptor
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:42.040]   are all basically put to sleep by high insulin.
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:45.040]   Insulin blocks leptin signaling.
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:47.560]   So the higher the insulin goes,
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:50.160]   the more your brain thinks you're starving,
[03:02:50.160 --> 03:02:52.320]   and the more your brain thinks you're starving,
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:55.440]   the hungrier you get and the less you wanna move.
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:00.440]   So the gluttony and sloth that we've been talking about
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:05.080]   all in our podcast is really biochemical.
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:08.080]   It is secondary to this phenomenon
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:11.160]   of insulin blocking leptin signaling.
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:12.360]   You gotta fix that first.
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:16.720]   Get the insulin down any way you can,
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:19.760]   and the best way, get rid of the refined
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:20.880]   carbohydrate and sugar.
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:23.360]   That's where you start.
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:26.280]   - It makes so much sense.
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:28.680]   - It works too, how about that?
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:29.640]   - That's always good.
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:30.840]   - It is.
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:32.960]   - I once heard you say, I think it was in a conversation
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:35.300]   with Peter Attia on his podcast,
[03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:37.620]   and this really stuck in my mind,
[03:03:37.620 --> 03:03:42.620]   that when a person consumes glucose,
[03:03:42.620 --> 03:03:46.440]   that it activates a number of different brain sites.
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:49.640]   You know, neurons loving glucose,
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:53.000]   but that when one ingests fructose,
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.160]   that it preferentially activates neurons
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:57.120]   in the reward pathway.
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:02.080]   At maybe seven times the magnitude or something like that.
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:04.700]   - Glucose activates the basal ganglia.
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:09.280]   This is work from Wollner House in Switzerland,
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:11.440]   and also Eric Stice at Oregon Health Sciences.
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:12.960]   - It's for movement and planning and execution.
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:14.720]   - Exactly, okay.
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:18.320]   Fructose basically stimulates the nucleus accumbens,
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:19.200]   the reward center.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:21.840]   It is just like heroin, just like cocaine,
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:23.800]   just like nicotine.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:25.680]   It activates the reward center.
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:28.620]   It doesn't do anything for the basal ganglia.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:31.760]   So it is addictive.
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:34.280]   Anything that stimulates the reward center
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:36.560]   in the extreme is addictive.
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:38.960]   So we have chemical addictions, heroin, cocaine,
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:40.480]   nicotine, alcohol, sugar.
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:42.800]   We have behavioral addictions, shopping, gambling,
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:45.720]   internet gaming, social media, pornography.
[03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:46.640]   Doesn't matter.
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:50.720]   They all stimulate dopamine in the reward center,
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:53.440]   and in the extreme, they are all addictive.
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:56.940]   So the question is, if you are addicted,
[03:04:56.940 --> 03:05:01.440]   is that personal responsibility?
[03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:03.700]   - Well, it's a very,
[03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:08.060]   it's a question I think about a lot,
[03:05:08.060 --> 03:05:10.600]   because I know a lot of people
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:13.280]   in the addiction recovery community,
[03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:16.120]   both from the treatment end and the addict end,
[03:05:16.120 --> 03:05:18.040]   and this always comes down to this question
[03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:20.400]   when somebody is suffering from an addiction of any kind
[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:22.560]   and they're resistant to getting treatment.
[03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:27.480]   If you look at them as being sick,
[03:05:27.480 --> 03:05:29.400]   at least in that moment,
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:32.200]   is a sick person in the best or worst
[03:05:32.200 --> 03:05:36.240]   or at least diminished position to guide their own treatment?
[03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:37.600]   So for instance, somebody with dementia,
[03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:40.560]   would you ask them, do you wanna go see a neurologist?
[03:05:40.560 --> 03:05:41.940]   You might ask them that,
[03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:44.040]   but are they the best person to make that decision?
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:45.280]   - Well, this is the problem.
[03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:49.660]   So this is where personal responsibility falls down.
[03:05:49.660 --> 03:05:51.740]   So personal responsibility,
[03:05:51.740 --> 03:05:54.400]   as we talked about four criteria have to be met,
[03:05:54.400 --> 03:05:55.360]   none of them are met.
[03:05:55.360 --> 03:05:57.160]   That's the first issue.
[03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:00.160]   Second one is a little bit, shall we say cheekier.
[03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:04.520]   Who invented personal responsibility?
[03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:05.440]   Any idea?
[03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:07.280]   - I'm definitely gonna get this one wrong.
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:08.840]   - Yeah, you're gonna get this one wrong.
[03:06:08.840 --> 03:06:09.680]   Are you ready?
[03:06:09.680 --> 03:06:10.520]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:12.560]   - The tobacco industry.
[03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:14.240]   - The notion of personal responsibility?
[03:06:14.240 --> 03:06:15.720]   - They invented it.
[03:06:15.720 --> 03:06:20.080]   There was no personal responsibility until tobacco in 1962,
[03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:22.640]   'cause they were getting killed on the science
[03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:26.480]   and they needed to invent another reason for you to smoke.
[03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:29.860]   In fact, there's a paper that came out, Dorfman et al,
[03:06:29.860 --> 03:06:33.360]   that looked at the New York Times and the Washington Post
[03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:38.360]   and they did an entire lit search of the entire,
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:46.160]   all of the output of those two newspapers for decades
[03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:49.000]   to look for the term personal responsibility.
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:54.000]   And the very first time it was ever mentioned was 1962.
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:58.940]   And it didn't pick up in speed until 1986,
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:02.160]   which was the same year as Cipollone v. Liggett
[03:07:02.160 --> 03:07:04.000]   at the Supreme Court,
[03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:09.000]   which basically said that the cigarette industry
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:14.280]   was guilty of plying people with an addictive substance.
[03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:21.120]   So this is very specifically industry-driven
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:24.160]   and we have the data to prove it.
[03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:25.320]   - Amazing.
[03:07:25.320 --> 03:07:30.320]   Well, I wonder, along the lines of personal responsibility,
[03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:34.560]   given that many listeners to this conversation
[03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:37.480]   are going to be thinking about their own food intake
[03:07:37.480 --> 03:07:39.800]   and food choices and that of their children
[03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:41.800]   and other relatives,
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:44.680]   that we could play a little, not a game,
[03:07:44.680 --> 03:07:48.440]   but a little rapid-ish fire Q&A.
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:50.040]   Never done this before in this podcast,
[03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:51.720]   but I think it's particularly appropriate
[03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:55.000]   for a discussion like this that weeks out into so many areas
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:56.600]   and I absolutely will invite you back
[03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:59.560]   and perhaps along with Alyssa Eppold
[03:07:59.560 --> 03:08:01.300]   to talk about some of the exciting work you guys are doing,
[03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:02.520]   'cause there's so much we could cover,
[03:08:02.520 --> 03:08:05.720]   but people are going to wonder in a very practical sense
[03:08:05.720 --> 03:08:08.000]   whether or not they should
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:09.520]   or should not be consuming certain things.
[03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:11.200]   And I know you're not the food police.
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:12.040]   - I'm not the food police.
[03:08:12.040 --> 03:08:14.360]   - And I'm not a cop and I do believe people
[03:08:14.360 --> 03:08:18.620]   should be in choice about these matters.
[03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:20.580]   But I also believe that,
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:21.840]   because you're a guest on the podcast
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:23.000]   and you're highly informed
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.480]   and I've done clinical work and research
[03:08:25.480 --> 03:08:27.920]   for so many years in this area,
[03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:30.680]   and you have such a clear stance on the role of big food
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:34.220]   and we really, really appreciate your honesty
[03:08:34.220 --> 03:08:35.060]   and directness,
[03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:37.160]   but now you'd be willing to provide a comment
[03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:39.420]   about a couple of different terms that I'll throw out.
[03:08:39.420 --> 03:08:42.220]   And if you choose to say really nothing to say about that,
[03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:43.520]   fine, that would be a quick pass.
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:45.520]   So here we go.
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:47.320]   And we covered a little bit of this earlier,
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:49.360]   but fruit in whole form.
[03:08:49.360 --> 03:08:54.040]   So has fructose, but has fiber.
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:56.160]   So thumbs up, thumb sideways
[03:08:56.160 --> 03:08:58.080]   or thumbs down for fruit consumption.
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:08:59.520]   - Fruit is fine.
[03:08:59.520 --> 03:09:01.320]   - Fruit juice is not.
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:02.420]   - Great, thank you.
[03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:05.560]   White rice versus brown rice.
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:08.120]   And among the white rice is the sticky rice
[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:10.540]   and the rice is with added sugars,
[03:09:10.540 --> 03:09:14.140]   which you find in a lot of restaurants.
[03:09:14.140 --> 03:09:16.760]   - Brown rice because of the fiber.
[03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:20.120]   White rice, polished, you know, number one,
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:22.160]   all the vitamin B1 gone.
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:25.740]   And of course, a much larger glucose excursion.
[03:09:25.740 --> 03:09:28.760]   That glycemic index thing, which of course I hate,
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:31.720]   it's glycemic load that matters.
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:34.480]   And that is a very high glycemic load.
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:35.720]   So brown rice.
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:38.220]   - So brown rice is better than white rice.
[03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:39.060]   - Yes.
[03:09:39.060 --> 03:09:40.020]   - Okay, in a meaningful way.
[03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:40.960]   - In a meaningful way.
[03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:42.280]   - Okay.
[03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:44.180]   Earlier you mentioned tomato sauce.
[03:09:44.180 --> 03:09:48.200]   I love tomato sauce that's made from just tomatoes.
[03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:51.940]   Can tomato, so are most tomato sauces filled with sugar?
[03:09:51.940 --> 03:09:53.200]   - Perfect.
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:57.440]   Our little recommendation engine looked at this question
[03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:00.240]   and it turns out that only 10%
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:03.920]   of the available tomato sauces out on the market
[03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:06.180]   don't have added sugar.
[03:10:06.180 --> 03:10:07.440]   So you have to know which ones.
[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:09.640]   Well, you can look yourself or you can look up perfect
[03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:12.460]   and it will tell you which ones you can buy.
[03:10:12.460 --> 03:10:17.060]   - If people chose to consume bread, which many people do,
[03:10:17.060 --> 03:10:20.440]   is there a way to just across the board
[03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:21.820]   without just baking your own
[03:10:21.820 --> 03:10:24.560]   or looking at the ingredients list to make a better choice?
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:26.680]   Is it like sourdoughs tend to have less sugar
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:29.320]   than blank?
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:31.200]   - Well, sourdough has been fermented
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:33.840]   so it will have actually consumed some of the sugar
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:35.400]   so it would be a better choice.
[03:10:35.400 --> 03:10:39.200]   But really the best choice is the highest fiber breads.
[03:10:39.200 --> 03:10:42.720]   Now, if you look at a wheat berry,
[03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:46.980]   it is 25% of fiber.
[03:10:46.980 --> 03:10:50.880]   The husk is 25% of the weight of that wheat berry.
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:54.280]   That means that the carbohydrate to fiber ratio
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:56.440]   of a wheat berry is three to one.
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:02.960]   So a good bread should have a carbohydrate to fiber ratio
[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:07.060]   of somewhere between three to one to five to one tops.
[03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:09.540]   Anything above that means that they've stripped
[03:11:09.540 --> 03:11:11.080]   the fiber away.
[03:11:11.080 --> 03:11:12.720]   So that's something you could do.
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:15.660]   But the easier way is to actually look it up on perfect.
[03:11:15.660 --> 03:11:19.280]   - You mentioned meat and meat sourcing,
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:21.620]   egg and chicken sourcing earlier.
[03:11:21.620 --> 03:11:23.700]   Maybe we just revisit that.
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:26.140]   Meat, fish and eggs, thumbs up, thumb sideways,
[03:11:26.140 --> 03:11:27.580]   thumbs down, or it depends?
[03:11:27.580 --> 03:11:28.420]   - It depends.
[03:11:28.420 --> 03:11:31.140]   It depends on where the meat came from.
[03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:33.380]   It depends on whether it was pasture raised.
[03:11:33.380 --> 03:11:36.180]   Depends on whether it's organic or not.
[03:11:36.180 --> 03:11:39.600]   If the animal was injected with antibiotics,
[03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:42.480]   stay away from it because those antibiotics are in the meat.
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:44.740]   They're gonna basically sterilize your gut
[03:11:44.740 --> 03:11:47.660]   and then the bad bacteria are gonna take over.
[03:11:47.660 --> 03:11:50.580]   We haven't really talked much about the microbiome today,
[03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:53.500]   but that's a whole podcast all by itself.
[03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:56.460]   - We can touch on it a little bit more.
[03:11:56.460 --> 03:11:58.420]   Low sugar fermented foods, thumbs up,
[03:11:58.420 --> 03:11:59.260]   thumb sideways, thumbs down.
[03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:03.500]   - Fermented foods, short chain fatty acids, all good.
[03:12:03.500 --> 03:12:05.700]   - What are your favorite sources of fermented foods?
[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:06.860]   - I like kimchi.
[03:12:06.860 --> 03:12:08.860]   - Yeah, I like kimchi too.
[03:12:08.860 --> 03:12:11.140]   I like some of the live sauerkrauts.
[03:12:11.140 --> 03:12:15.920]   - Yeah, that's also good, but with the right accoutrement.
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:21.820]   The one thing I would be careful about is yogurt, okay?
[03:12:21.940 --> 03:12:24.940]   So there are yogurts with live cultures
[03:12:24.940 --> 03:12:27.620]   and there are a whole lot of yogurts with dead cultures.
[03:12:27.620 --> 03:12:29.760]   And if it's a yogurt with dead cultures,
[03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:32.180]   it's kind of irrelevant and the chances are
[03:12:32.180 --> 03:12:36.300]   they've actually covered up the sourness with sugar.
[03:12:36.300 --> 03:12:40.640]   So large commercially available yogurt,
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:42.820]   be very, very careful, okay?
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:47.820]   If it's an artisan yogurt made by people you know or trust,
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:54.340]   that's a very different story, yogurts with live cultures.
[03:12:54.340 --> 03:12:56.900]   - Intermittent fasting, do you practice it
[03:12:56.900 --> 03:12:58.340]   and what do you think about it?
[03:12:58.340 --> 03:13:01.600]   - I don't practice it, but I am for it,
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:02.940]   for the right patient.
[03:13:02.940 --> 03:13:04.620]   Turns out who's the right patient?
[03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:08.140]   The patient with liver fat because the reason it works
[03:13:08.140 --> 03:13:09.660]   is 'cause it gives the liver a chance
[03:13:09.660 --> 03:13:13.120]   to basically burn off the fat that it's stored.
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:17.780]   - Zero calorie soda, got it, definitely no.
[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:20.900]   And I don't even have to ask about sugary soda
[03:13:20.900 --> 03:13:25.300]   because that's basically just poison in a can.
[03:13:25.300 --> 03:13:27.740]   - Food combinations, I have a feeling
[03:13:27.740 --> 03:13:28.580]   I know what your answer is,
[03:13:28.580 --> 03:13:31.760]   but the glycemic index, which we know your feelings on now,
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:35.800]   asserts that if you combine some fat with a sugary,
[03:13:35.800 --> 03:13:36.980]   like eating ice cream,
[03:13:36.980 --> 03:13:39.020]   you have a more blunted insulin response
[03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:41.700]   than if you were to eat pure sugar of equivalent calories.
[03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:45.680]   But what are your thoughts on food combinations
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:48.000]   as a way to blunt the insulin response?
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:49.100]   - Food combinations are great
[03:13:49.100 --> 03:13:51.200]   if there's some fiber associated with it.
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:53.980]   - Comes back to fiber again.
[03:13:53.980 --> 03:13:55.580]   - And by the way, and by the way,
[03:13:55.580 --> 03:14:00.180]   full disclosure, I am the chief medical officer
[03:14:00.180 --> 03:14:01.340]   of a fiber company.
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:02.180]   - What is it?
[03:14:02.180 --> 03:14:06.100]   - It is called biolumen and it is a proprietary fiber.
[03:14:06.100 --> 03:14:11.100]   It is a microcellulose sponge, seven microns in diameter,
[03:14:11.100 --> 03:14:13.940]   so the size of a red blood cell.
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:18.020]   You swallow it, it goes to your stomach,
[03:14:18.020 --> 03:14:22.020]   it expands 70-fold over its original size,
[03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:23.980]   and so it'll give you a feeling of fullness
[03:14:23.980 --> 03:14:26.200]   'cause it's taking up space in the stomach,
[03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:29.540]   but more importantly, when it expands,
[03:14:29.540 --> 03:14:33.960]   the nooks and the crannies in the sponge become available,
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:35.820]   and embedded in those nooks and crannies
[03:14:35.820 --> 03:14:39.060]   are a set of proprietary hydrogels, soluble fiber,
[03:14:39.060 --> 03:14:43.060]   which sequester glucose, fructose, sucrose, simple starches,
[03:14:43.060 --> 03:14:45.820]   and render them unavailable for early absorption
[03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:48.840]   in the duodenum, thus reducing the glucose response,
[03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:52.940]   reducing the insulin response, protecting the liver,
[03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:55.240]   and moving it through the intestine
[03:14:55.240 --> 03:14:58.540]   so that microbiome can chew it up for its own purposes,
[03:14:58.540 --> 03:14:59.980]   feeding the gut.
[03:14:59.980 --> 03:15:03.580]   We can reduce glucose absorption by 36%,
[03:15:03.580 --> 03:15:08.100]   fructose absorption by 38%, sucrose absorption by 40%,
[03:15:08.100 --> 03:15:10.660]   simple starch absorption by 9%,
[03:15:10.660 --> 03:15:15.660]   and increase short-chain fatty acid production by 60%
[03:15:15.660 --> 03:15:19.260]   without an increase in gas.
[03:15:19.260 --> 03:15:22.000]   - When do people take this?
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:23.420]   - With meals.
[03:15:23.420 --> 03:15:24.260]   - Okay.
[03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:28.180]   - So it comes as a sachet, one teaspoon,
[03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:31.980]   sprinkle it on your food or take it in a drink,
[03:15:31.980 --> 03:15:34.540]   just mix it in and slug it down,
[03:15:34.540 --> 03:15:37.240]   and then eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner,
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:42.240]   and it will basically act like you ate real food.
[03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:47.880]   It will turn processed food into real food in the intestine.
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:51.000]   And we have clinical trial data that demonstrates that.
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:52.340]   - Is it available as a commercial product?
[03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:53.180]   - It is available.
[03:15:53.180 --> 03:15:55.280]   It is called Munch Munch.
[03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:56.360]   Now, I hate that name.
[03:15:56.360 --> 03:15:57.520]   I didn't make it up.
[03:15:57.520 --> 03:15:58.360]   - Well, I'm gonna--
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:00.680]   - The marketers did that.
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:01.860]   - Your marketing team sucks,
[03:16:01.860 --> 03:16:03.240]   but the product sounds amazing.
[03:16:03.240 --> 03:16:05.560]   - Yes, biolumin.tech.
[03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:07.420]   - Great, thank you for that.
[03:16:07.420 --> 03:16:09.060]   Sorry, Munch Munch marketing team,
[03:16:09.060 --> 03:16:12.060]   but you got a Munch Munch to a new product name.
[03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:15.740]   But it sounds like a very interesting product,
[03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:18.140]   and it actually answered my next question,
[03:16:18.140 --> 03:16:21.240]   which was about fiber supplements.
[03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:24.740]   - Fiber is good, but there are two kinds of fiber.
[03:16:24.740 --> 03:16:27.260]   There's soluble and there's insoluble,
[03:16:27.260 --> 03:16:28.620]   and they are not the same.
[03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:32.180]   So soluble is what goes into fiber one bars,
[03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:35.900]   you know, that's psyllium, inulin, pectin,
[03:16:35.900 --> 03:16:40.940]   like what holds jelly together.
[03:16:40.940 --> 03:16:43.060]   That's good.
[03:16:43.060 --> 03:16:44.640]   I'm not saying it's bad,
[03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:47.740]   but you need the insoluble fiber, the cellulose,
[03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:51.380]   the stringy stuff in celery, the cardboard, if you will.
[03:16:51.380 --> 03:16:55.380]   Together, they form this gel that we talked about earlier.
[03:16:55.380 --> 03:16:57.400]   If you only consume the soluble fiber,
[03:16:57.400 --> 03:17:00.580]   which is what the food industry will add to food,
[03:17:00.580 --> 03:17:03.260]   'cause the insoluble fiber is not miscible.
[03:17:03.260 --> 03:17:05.740]   If you only add the soluble fiber back,
[03:17:05.740 --> 03:17:07.860]   you're not getting the benefits
[03:17:07.860 --> 03:17:10.020]   of the entire fiber complement.
[03:17:10.020 --> 03:17:13.000]   - Earlier, when talking about the Nova system
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:17.220]   and how most all of our foods are nine,
[03:17:17.220 --> 03:17:19.000]   let's say, I know it was seven to 10%,
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:22.620]   let's say 95%, let's say are on the side of better.
[03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:24.940]   95% of our foods should come from Nova system
[03:17:24.940 --> 03:17:26.340]   class one or class two foods.
[03:17:26.340 --> 03:17:27.180]   - Or three.
[03:17:27.180 --> 03:17:28.560]   - Or three, okay, staying away
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:30.620]   from those Nova class four foods.
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:32.940]   Could you give us some examples of Nova class one
[03:17:32.940 --> 03:17:37.020]   and class two foods, just broadly speaking?
[03:17:37.020 --> 03:17:41.760]   - Okay, Nova class one is any food without a label, period.
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:47.000]   If you see a label on a food, it's a warning label.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.740]   - Well, there's ground beef has a label.
[03:17:49.740 --> 03:17:50.580]   Okay, so that's--
[03:17:50.580 --> 03:17:51.420]   - Well, does it?
[03:17:51.420 --> 03:17:53.120]   - So you're talking about apple.
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:54.660]   Well, when I buy it, it has a label.
[03:17:54.660 --> 03:17:56.180]   I'm asking this because people are gonna wonder.
[03:17:56.180 --> 03:17:58.700]   - Well, it doesn't have a nutrition facts label.
[03:17:58.700 --> 03:18:00.980]   Is there a nutrition facts label on a thing of ground beef?
[03:18:00.980 --> 03:18:05.980]   - I buy that ground beef where I consume venison
[03:18:05.980 --> 03:18:08.020]   where if you flip it over, it says how many calories,
[03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:08.860]   how many protein.
[03:18:08.860 --> 03:18:12.900]   So there's a label, but it's just B for venison.
[03:18:12.900 --> 03:18:14.920]   - Okay, and that's class one.
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:16.040]   - Okay, egg?
[03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:17.460]   - Egg is class one.
[03:18:17.460 --> 03:18:19.440]   - So, and then of course, fruit, apples, orange.
[03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:22.400]   Okay, so it doesn't matter if it has a name tag
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:25.780]   as long as it doesn't have an ingredients list.
[03:18:25.780 --> 03:18:27.420]   - Got it.
[03:18:27.420 --> 03:18:29.660]   - Real food does not need a label.
[03:18:29.660 --> 03:18:32.340]   It's only if they did something to it
[03:18:32.340 --> 03:18:33.620]   that it needs a label.
[03:18:33.620 --> 03:18:36.220]   So you have to look at every label as a warning label.
[03:18:36.220 --> 03:18:37.520]   Now, the problem with the label
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:39.240]   is it only tells you what's in the food.
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:40.300]   What you really need to know
[03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:42.420]   is what's been done to the food
[03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:45.180]   because it's the ultra processed food that's the problem.
[03:18:45.180 --> 03:18:47.060]   They don't wanna tell you that.
[03:18:47.060 --> 03:18:49.020]   That's secret.
[03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:51.220]   Okay, secret from a proprietary standpoint,
[03:18:51.220 --> 03:18:53.880]   but also secret because if you knew what they did to it,
[03:18:53.880 --> 03:18:56.340]   you wouldn't eat it, you would never buy it.
[03:18:56.340 --> 03:18:57.940]   And they don't want you to know.
[03:18:57.940 --> 03:19:00.580]   So they only tell you what's in the food.
[03:19:00.580 --> 03:19:02.180]   That's not what's important.
[03:19:02.180 --> 03:19:04.380]   It's what's been done to the food that's important.
[03:19:04.380 --> 03:19:07.080]   And that's why this NOBA class four is so important
[03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:09.480]   and that's why perfect is so important
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:11.700]   because it'll do the work for you.
[03:19:11.700 --> 03:19:14.760]   - Great, we'll definitely provide links to all of these.
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:19.760]   So if you could pick one thing to recommend to people
[03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:23.640]   that want to improve their health.
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:25.740]   - Get rid of the sugar, period.
[03:19:25.740 --> 03:19:26.580]   - Very clear.
[03:19:26.580 --> 03:19:27.520]   - That's number one.
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:30.780]   Number two, go for a walk.
[03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:32.620]   - The exercise piece.
[03:19:32.620 --> 03:19:33.820]   - Go for a walk.
[03:19:33.820 --> 03:19:36.620]   - And if you could recommend one thing
[03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:40.820]   that the general public can do to try and assist
[03:19:40.820 --> 03:19:46.260]   in this advocacy for not redefining,
[03:19:46.260 --> 03:19:49.040]   but actually clearly defining what is food and what isn't
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:53.380]   and making people aware at the level of policy and change
[03:19:53.380 --> 03:19:54.240]   and school lunches.
[03:19:54.240 --> 03:19:56.240]   I mean, if there were one thing, what can we do?
[03:19:56.240 --> 03:19:59.280]   I mean, you've clearly activated my neurons surrounding
[03:19:59.280 --> 03:20:01.420]   like the set of problems that exist
[03:20:01.420 --> 03:20:03.160]   and the paths to correct them,
[03:20:03.160 --> 03:20:06.060]   but should we be writing to our Congress people?
[03:20:06.060 --> 03:20:09.220]   Should we be getting angry at hospitals
[03:20:09.220 --> 03:20:11.160]   because they've got all these fast food machines
[03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:15.060]   and that the cafeteria food is like illness promoting?
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:17.760]   - At UCSF, we've gotten rid of all sugar beverages.
[03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:19.800]   We have the healthy beverage initiative.
[03:20:19.800 --> 03:20:21.400]   So you can-- - No Coke machines at UCSF?
[03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:22.940]   - No Coke machines at UCSF.
[03:20:22.940 --> 03:20:24.380]   - Oh, Stanford, check that out,
[03:20:24.380 --> 03:20:27.320]   'cause people always send me pictures of the Coke machines
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:28.180]   in the school of medicine.
[03:20:28.180 --> 03:20:31.980]   I'm like, listen, I didn't put them there, but I--
[03:20:31.980 --> 03:20:34.680]   - We have to model for the public.
[03:20:34.680 --> 03:20:37.020]   I mean, where was the first place
[03:20:37.020 --> 03:20:38.220]   that smoking was banned?
[03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:40.320]   Hospitals, okay?
[03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:41.600]   Because we knew.
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:46.600]   So if you get rid of the soda,
[03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:49.300]   if you get rid of the sugared soda at the hospital,
[03:20:49.300 --> 03:20:51.540]   you're telling people something.
[03:20:51.540 --> 03:20:53.840]   So yeah, I think that every hospital
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:20:57.300]   and really every public venue in America
[03:20:57.300 --> 03:21:00.280]   needs to clear out the junk.
[03:21:00.280 --> 03:21:02.780]   - So post photos of junk that are supposed to be
[03:21:02.780 --> 03:21:05.180]   in health promoting institutions,
[03:21:05.180 --> 03:21:07.760]   and I guess we're trying to cancel junk food.
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:08.720]   - Shame, shame. - We're trying
[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:10.260]   to cancel junk food.
[03:21:10.260 --> 03:21:12.660]   I'm pretty opposed to cancel culture, but here we go.
[03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:14.500]   We're gonna cancel.
[03:21:14.500 --> 03:21:16.520]   Marvelous, it's actionable, it's straightforward,
[03:21:16.520 --> 03:21:18.360]   it's low cost, low time investment.
[03:21:18.360 --> 03:21:20.740]   Zero cost, very low time investment.
[03:21:20.740 --> 03:21:21.700]   So thank you for that.
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:23.700]   - And look up Eat Real,
[03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:26.500]   because we're doing it for your kids.
[03:21:26.500 --> 03:21:29.500]   So you need to help support it.
[03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:33.140]   Any school district in America can do it.
[03:21:33.140 --> 03:21:34.420]   So what do we do?
[03:21:34.420 --> 03:21:37.220]   We have a business model whereby
[03:21:37.220 --> 03:21:42.220]   the food services director either purchases or rents
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:45.180]   a dilapidated factory in the center of the district,
[03:21:45.180 --> 03:21:48.360]   repurposes it into a food preparation facility.
[03:21:48.360 --> 03:21:52.220]   They can make 27 to 30,000 meals a day, okay,
[03:21:52.220 --> 03:21:57.220]   with a skeleton crew, and you control what's in it.
[03:21:57.220 --> 03:22:01.160]   And because you're buying in volume,
[03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:04.560]   it actually reduces the cost, so it's cheaper
[03:22:04.560 --> 03:22:08.400]   than buying it from Cisco or Aramark or Sodexo or wherever.
[03:22:08.400 --> 03:22:11.800]   And then you farm it out via truck or bus
[03:22:11.800 --> 03:22:13.000]   to all the different schools.
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:18.000]   So every kid gets a hot meal made from scratch,
[03:22:18.360 --> 03:22:22.720]   each day, and we can solve this problem.
[03:22:22.720 --> 03:22:28.060]   - Can't help but ask this one last question.
[03:22:28.060 --> 03:22:29.820]   For people that want to cut out sugar,
[03:22:29.820 --> 03:22:32.300]   which you clearly stated is the most important thing to do
[03:22:32.300 --> 03:22:37.120]   for one's health, how do we know
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:39.020]   how much sugar is in something?
[03:22:39.020 --> 03:22:40.820]   So should people be looking at labels
[03:22:40.820 --> 03:22:43.500]   and just looking for how much sugar, how much carbohydrate,
[03:22:43.500 --> 03:22:45.880]   or could we even go so far as to say,
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:49.140]   if it says high fructose corn syrup,
[03:22:49.140 --> 03:22:51.500]   then it's on the no-fly list.
[03:22:51.500 --> 03:22:52.780]   Don't eat it.
[03:22:52.780 --> 03:22:57.340]   - So the problem is that there are 262 names for sugar,
[03:22:57.340 --> 03:23:00.540]   and the food industry uses all of them.
[03:23:00.540 --> 03:23:01.780]   And the reason they use all of them
[03:23:01.780 --> 03:23:04.820]   is because they can include a different sugar
[03:23:04.820 --> 03:23:06.500]   as number five, number six, number seven,
[03:23:06.500 --> 03:23:08.180]   number eight, number nine on the list,
[03:23:08.180 --> 03:23:11.220]   and when you add it up, it becomes number one.
[03:23:11.220 --> 03:23:14.900]   They hide it in plain sight, and they do it on purpose.
[03:23:15.740 --> 03:23:20.740]   Now, do I expect everybody to memorize all 262 names?
[03:23:20.740 --> 03:23:22.100]   No, of course not.
[03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:25.520]   Can you figure it out yourself?
[03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:30.040]   Well, the answer is no, unless they have the line
[03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:32.520]   where it says added sugars.
[03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:35.800]   If it says added sugars, it is either sucrose
[03:23:35.800 --> 03:23:36.880]   or high fructose corn syrup.
[03:23:36.880 --> 03:23:39.380]   No one's adding lactose, okay?
[03:23:39.380 --> 03:23:41.140]   That's not-- - Or glucose.
[03:23:41.140 --> 03:23:42.480]   - They're not even adding glucose,
[03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:44.560]   because glucose isn't that sweet.
[03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:46.220]   Glucose is not that interesting.
[03:23:46.220 --> 03:23:47.380]   You don't see people going around
[03:23:47.380 --> 03:23:49.300]   chugging carose syrup, do you?
[03:23:49.300 --> 03:23:50.480]   Okay, that's glucose.
[03:23:50.480 --> 03:23:51.460]   Who cares?
[03:23:51.460 --> 03:23:52.960]   Yeah, it might be good in the molasses cookie,
[03:23:52.960 --> 03:23:54.800]   but that's it, all right?
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:57.180]   So it's fructose.
[03:23:57.180 --> 03:23:59.940]   So you need to know what's been added.
[03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:03.960]   So if it says added sugars, that's a good place to start.
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:08.120]   No greater than one teaspoon per serving.
[03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:13.120]   No greater than four grams per serving of added sugars.
[03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:16.120]   Anything greater than that, leave it at the store.
[03:24:16.120 --> 03:24:19.680]   - And aim for those Nova type 1, type 2.
[03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:21.840]   - Aim for Nova types 1, 2, and 3.
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:25.040]   And if you don't know whether it's Nova type 1, 2, or 3,
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:27.880]   you can use perfect, and if you don't look at that,
[03:24:27.880 --> 03:24:31.320]   then go look at the Nutrition Facts label,
[03:24:31.320 --> 03:24:34.880]   and anything that has more than four ingredients
[03:24:34.880 --> 03:24:36.640]   is Nova Class 4.
[03:24:36.640 --> 03:24:39.160]   - Robert Lustig, thank you so much.
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:42.120]   You've provided such an incredible education
[03:24:42.120 --> 03:24:43.880]   in nutritional biochemistry,
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:47.620]   the processing of fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar,
[03:24:47.620 --> 03:24:49.200]   fructose in particular,
[03:24:49.200 --> 03:24:51.920]   the clear detriments of consuming fructose
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:53.800]   on so many different organ systems.
[03:24:53.800 --> 03:24:58.220]   I love, love, love that you separated out food science,
[03:24:58.220 --> 03:25:01.480]   nutrition, and metabolic health.
[03:25:01.480 --> 03:25:07.080]   That's a gazillion dollar delineation
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:10.000]   for people to understand and to shape their understanding
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.560]   of all the information that's out there
[03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:14.840]   and bins into these different categories.
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:16.960]   You've given us so many actionable tools,
[03:25:16.960 --> 03:25:19.960]   new conceptual frameworks.
[03:25:19.960 --> 03:25:22.180]   You've given us a real tour de force today
[03:25:22.180 --> 03:25:25.600]   in just oh so clear language.
[03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:27.560]   So I want to thank you.
[03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:32.560]   I've learned a ton, and I know everyone else has as well.
[03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:33.720]   And if people have questions,
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:36.320]   they can of course put them in the comment section
[03:25:36.320 --> 03:25:37.660]   on YouTube, that's the best place.
[03:25:37.660 --> 03:25:40.380]   We'll provide links to all the companies
[03:25:40.380 --> 03:25:42.820]   and websites that you referenced
[03:25:42.820 --> 03:25:44.360]   and some of your other work.
[03:25:44.360 --> 03:25:49.360]   And listen, I'm so grateful that you exist
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:51.020]   and that you've done the work that you've done
[03:25:51.020 --> 03:25:54.900]   and your passion and your advocacy for health
[03:25:54.900 --> 03:25:57.000]   is just oh so clear.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:58.300]   So thank you so much.
[03:25:58.300 --> 03:26:00.620]   - So I want to thank you.
[03:26:00.620 --> 03:26:02.960]   And the reason I want to thank you is first of all,
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:04.680]   inviting me, that's nice, that's good.
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:09.440]   But the reason is because people need to understand science.
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:13.660]   I am completely in agreement with you.
[03:26:13.660 --> 03:26:16.160]   The public needs to understand science.
[03:26:16.160 --> 03:26:19.200]   They listen to you because you number one,
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:21.400]   provide the science and number two,
[03:26:21.400 --> 03:26:23.540]   you don't talk down to them.
[03:26:23.540 --> 03:26:25.480]   You treat them as equals.
[03:26:25.480 --> 03:26:28.200]   And that is truly remarkable.
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:31.600]   And so I want to thank you for your service.
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:33.280]   - Well you're most welcome.
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:36.320]   It's a labor of love and I think it was the great
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:40.640]   Max Delbrück that said when teaching assume zero knowledge
[03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:42.020]   and infinite intelligence.
[03:26:42.020 --> 03:26:44.460]   And I do believe that humans are infinitely intelligent,
[03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:46.840]   although sometimes as a whole we mask it.
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:49.320]   People deserve the knowledge.
[03:26:49.320 --> 03:26:51.580]   So thank you so much for sharing that knowledge today
[03:26:51.580 --> 03:26:53.340]   and let's absolutely have you back.
[03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:54.940]   - My pleasure, thank you.
[03:26:54.940 --> 03:26:56.680]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:26:56.680 --> 03:26:58.720]   with Dr. Robert Lustig about nutrition
[03:26:58.720 --> 03:27:02.260]   and how sugar impacts the health of our brain and body.
[03:27:02.260 --> 03:27:04.200]   To learn more about Dr. Lustig's work
[03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:06.560]   and to find links to the many books that he's written
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:08.200]   on this and other topics,
[03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:10.180]   please see the show note captions.
[03:27:10.180 --> 03:27:12.500]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,

[03:27:36.020 --> 03:27:38.060]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.

[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:41.940]   Not so much on today's episode,
[03:27:41.940 --> 03:27:44.740]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:46.300]   we discuss supplements.
[03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:48.460]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:27:48.460 --> 03:27:50.720]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:53.340]   for things like improving sleep, for hormone support,
[03:27:53.340 --> 03:27:54.680]   and for improving focus.
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:56.280]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:57.820]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:27:57.820 --> 03:28:00.340]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[03:28:00.340 --> 03:28:03.460]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:28:03.460 --> 03:28:05.540]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:28:05.540 --> 03:28:08.660]   I am Huberman Lab on Instagram, X,
[03:28:08.660 --> 03:28:11.820]   formerly called Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[03:28:11.820 --> 03:28:13.080]   And at all of those places,
[03:28:13.080 --> 03:28:15.380]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:28:15.380 --> 03:28:16.900]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:28:16.900 --> 03:28:18.320]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:28:18.320 --> 03:28:20.100]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:28:20.100 --> 03:28:21.580]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:28:21.580 --> 03:28:25.220]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[03:28:25.220 --> 03:28:26.380]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:28:26.380 --> 03:28:28.140]   to our neural network newsletter,
[03:28:28.140 --> 03:28:30.700]   our neural network newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[03:28:30.700 --> 03:28:32.200]   that comes out every month.
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:34.100]   It includes podcast summaries,
[03:28:34.100 --> 03:28:36.660]   as well as protocols in the form of short PDFs
[03:28:36.660 --> 03:28:38.620]   of maybe just one to three pages,
[03:28:38.620 --> 03:28:41.100]   where I list out the specific protocols,
[03:28:41.100 --> 03:28:43.980]   for instance, for improving dopamine functioning,
[03:28:43.980 --> 03:28:45.840]   or for improving your sleep,
[03:28:45.840 --> 03:28:47.580]   or for deliberate cold exposure,
[03:28:47.580 --> 03:28:50.180]   deliberate heat exposure, or fitness protocols,
[03:28:50.180 --> 03:28:51.260]   and on and on,
[03:28:51.260 --> 03:28:54.840]   all of which are presented in brief fashion, very direct,
[03:28:54.840 --> 03:28:57.980]   just the protocols listed out, again, completely zero cost.
[03:28:57.980 --> 03:29:00.680]   To sign up, you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:01.860]   go to the menu function,
[03:29:01.860 --> 03:29:04.380]   scroll down to newsletter, and enter your email.
[03:29:04.380 --> 03:29:05.400]   And I should point out
[03:29:05.400 --> 03:29:08.000]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.340]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:29:09.340 --> 03:29:12.020]   for today's discussion with Dr. Robert Lustig.
[03:29:12.020 --> 03:29:14.180]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:29:14.180 --> 03:29:16.020]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:29:16.020 --> 03:29:18.600]   [upbeat music]
[03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:21.200]   (upbeat music)
