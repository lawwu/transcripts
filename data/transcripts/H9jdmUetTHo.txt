[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   All right, I think we have time for one more work related question. And this final question
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.560]   comes from Alicia. Alicia says, Hi, Cal. I'm a longtime fan of yours. I am thrilled to
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.040]   finally to be finally setting up my own home office for a sole proprietorship. I am one
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.020]   year into business and wondering about scaling up. I'm looking to collaborate with people
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.320]   for specific needs instead of hiring employees. What are your thoughts on scaling up for sole
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.440]   proprietors? Well, Alicia, I have a book recommendation. I think you are at a perfect point to read
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.260]   Paul Jarvis's book, Company of One. And he interrogates in this book, this question of
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.320]   scaling up your small business and what he interrogates it to make sure that that's actually
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.800]   what you want to do. He says this is always the pressure. Companies need to grow, get
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.400]   more people get more employees or contractors increase the deal flow, increase the revenue,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.480]   increase the products that you're offering. But he argues that that does not necessarily
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.780]   put you in the better position. Yes, that is the necessary steps if you one day want
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.520]   to have a company worth millions, but most people aren't going to get there anyways.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.120]   And what you get along the way is all the stress that comes from the growing, all the
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.840]   stress from managing all the different contractors or employees, all the stress that comes from
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.620]   having the additional products, the additional clients. His alternative is to instead focus
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.880]   on getting better and better at what you do. Instead of leveraging that to get more clients,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.740]   you leverage that to get paid more per hour for the clients that you currently work on.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.640]   Your revenue grows, your time expenditure doesn't. And you try to find some sort of
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   sweet spot where you have a lot of autonomy, your time demands are reasonable, but you're
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.920]   making good money. That's not what everyone wants to do. I think some people say the sole
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   proprietorship is step one towards an empire. And I think that's absolutely fine. You know
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.400]   what you feel, I just want to make sure that you're not falling into a scaling mode because
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.640]   you don't know what else you're supposed to do. Because you think if I have opportunities,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   of course I have to go after them. If there's more work I could take on, why would I turn
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.820]   that down? And I think Paul does a great job in that book of saying, make sure before you
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.280]   do that, that that's what you really want to do. It reminds me about this quote that
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.980]   I bring up often on this show that I believe I heard Joe Rogan say once, where someone
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.640]   was talking to him about assistance. Everyone in Hollywood has assistance. I've been around
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.000]   Hollywood people who have assistance. He doesn't. And his argument was, if I get to the point
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.320]   where I feel that I need an assistant just to keep track of everything that's going on,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.200]   that's my cue to do less. That's the Paul Jarvis mindset stated pithily. So Alicia,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.680]   you're at a great decision point. You're at an exciting decision point. Read Company of
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   One. I blurbed it so you know it's good. Read that book, do some reflection and figure out,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   do I want to scale and only then you can figure out the mechanics of how to find people how
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.920]   to hire people. A lot of people have written about that. A lot of people have good advice
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.440]   to offer on that. You probably don't want my advice on that. But ask that big question
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.800]   first.
