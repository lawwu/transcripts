[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280]   - Is God humble?
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.180]   Is God humble?
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.680]   It seems like such a simple question.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.080]   It's actually a pretty simple question,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.740]   but the answer is not.
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.960]   It's a great question,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.160]   exactly the kind of question we've come to expect
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   from our perceptive listeners out there,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.440]   this time from a listener named Tanner.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.880]   Hello, Tony and Pastor John.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.520]   Thank you for your faithful service to God
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.960]   and to his people across the world through this podcast.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.880]   I was recently thinking about how the pursuit
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.520]   of good character is the pursuit to better imitate
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.560]   the inherent goodness of God.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.720]   But I hit a mental hurdle
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.120]   when I applied this framework to humility.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.480]   Throughout your ministry,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.320]   you have defined our humility
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.120]   as knowledge of our own fallibility.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   This cannot work for God, obviously,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.480]   so perhaps God cannot be humble because he's infallible.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.880]   Is God humble at all, or can we imitate him or not?
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.840]   Or is humility reserved for creatures?
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.600]   Pastor John, what would you say to Tanner?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.360]   Tanner has put his finger on a concern
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.160]   that I have had for a long time,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.160]   namely that we might make God imitation
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.480]   or even Christ imitation, like what would Jesus do?
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.320]   The bracelets we used to raise.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.360]   We might make God imitation and Christ imitation
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.280]   too central in the way we think about the pursuit
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.320]   of holiness or virtue or love.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.400]   And the reason I'm concerned is the very problem
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.920]   that Tanner has seen, namely, there is a lot about God
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.840]   we dare not imitate.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   Clearly, Paul says, "Be imitators of me as I am of Christ,"
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.320]   1 Corinthians 11, 1.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   But Paul knows, and we know, that we dare not imitate Christ
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.480]   in some of his most glorious pursuits and achievements.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.040]   Don't imitate Christ in his authority to forgive sins.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   Don't imitate Christ in his right to say,
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.120]   "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.880]   Don't imitate Christ in his glorious bearing of the sins
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.000]   of his people as the Lamb of God.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Don't imitate Christ in his claim to have no sin in himself.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.840]   Don't imitate Christ in his authority to say,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.400]   "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   And clearly, Paul says, "Be imitators of God
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.400]   as beloved children," Ephesians 5.1.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.000]   But Paul knows, we know, Satan knows,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.160]   that the wrong kind of God imitation
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.480]   is not the height of godliness,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.040]   but the height of rebellion against God.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360]   What was the essence of Satan's temptation
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.520]   that brought down the entire creation into misery?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.360]   What was it?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.520]   Genesis 3.5.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.080]   God knows, this is Satan talking,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.800]   God knows that when you eat of the forbidden tree,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   your eyes will be opened and you will be like God.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.520]   Come on, come on, perfect, be a perfect imitator of God.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.680]   So you can see why I'm concerned
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   that we not make God imitation or Christ imitation
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.440]   too central in our pursuit of holiness.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.640]   It is not, let me say this just purely biblically,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.280]   it is not the dominant way in the New Testament
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.520]   or the Old Testament of pursuing godliness.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.560]   It's not.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.840]   It is there, to be sure, it is there, it is right.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.120]   Be holy for I am holy, 1 Peter 1.15.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.520]   But far more prominent, underline it, let me say it again,
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   far more prominent in the Bible is obey God's word.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.080]   Not his example, his word.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.120]   100 times more often in the Bible
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.360]   are we called to bring our lives in conformity to God's word
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.520]   and to act in a way that accords with the gospel
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   and that flows from faith.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.880]   These are the great guidelines for behavior,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   more prominent than imitation of God or Christ.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.080]   If we pay attention to the context of each place
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.240]   where God imitation or Christ imitation is referred to,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.360]   we will be protected from most abuses.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.240]   For example, Ephesians 5, one where it says,
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.680]   be imitators of God as beloved children
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   and walk in love as Christ loved us.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.360]   That helps, I mean, that puts a point on it
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.840]   and a guidance to it.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.680]   When a child imitates daddy or mommy,
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.480]   the child has no thought of being daddy.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.440]   I'm gonna become daddy.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.680]   He doesn't wanna be daddy.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.500]   There are dozens of attributes that mommy and daddy have
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.080]   that the child neither wants nor has,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   but desperately needs them to have.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.920]   He wants to be dependent on mommy and daddy,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.820]   but he does learn most of what makes him get along
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.800]   in the world by watching mommy and daddy.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   That's the context.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.920]   Then Paul points to Christ in those verses in Ephesians 5
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.240]   as the way God loved us.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.560]   Now to Tanner's more specific question,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.200]   perhaps God cannot be humble because he's so infallible.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.080]   Is God humble, he asks.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.480]   Can we imitate him here
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.180]   or is humility reserved for creatures?
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.840]   Now that's a tricky question.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.680]   - Yeah.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.160]   - So many questions are tricky.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   It's tricky because language does surprising things.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.680]   The problem with saying that God is not humble
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.880]   is that we usually think of the opposite of humility
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   as a kind of insecure braggart or show-off or windbag.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.720]   At the human level, someone who makes it his aim
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.280]   to have his name exalted is morally defective.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.760]   And yet throughout the whole Bible,
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.280]   God does that very thing.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.640]   He seeks to exalt his name so that it is known
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.840]   and loved and praised and honored.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.280]   Isaiah 48, 11, "For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.420]   "How should my name be profane?
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.680]   "My glory I will not give to another."
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.740]   If a mere man were to talk like that,
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.680]   we'd call him a megalomaniac.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   But the solution to that is not to say God is humble.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.880]   The solution is to say God is loving.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.020]   When God exalts his name,
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.780]   he's exalting the most beautiful,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.800]   the most valuable reality in the universe,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.240]   namely himself, precisely for the enjoyment
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.000]   of his believing creatures.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800]   God is in a class by himself.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.960]   We cannot follow him in this.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   His most loving act is to exalt himself
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.640]   as the all-satisfying one
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.160]   for his people's everlasting pleasure.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.800]   And he does it at the cost of the life of his son.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   Nobody else can love like this,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.240]   cannot imitate that, offering themselves,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.480]   offering ourselves as the all-satisfying treasure
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.320]   in the universe.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.400]   We don't imitate God by exalting ourselves
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.120]   the way God exalts himself.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   We imitate God rightly by exalting God
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.480]   the way God exalts God,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.720]   because we're not God and we can't be God.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.200]   We shouldn't want to be God.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   But that means we are humble in precisely this sense
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.440]   which he cannot be.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.520]   Humility for us at its heart
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.880]   is to feel and think and say and act
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   in a way that shows I am not God.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.000]   I try to get on my knees once a day
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.760]   just for 10 seconds or longer and say,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.680]   just wanted to remind myself, Lord,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.960]   I'm not God and I'm glad.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   That may seem strange, but there it is.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.400]   I think the very essence of humility
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.240]   is to say and act in a way that says I'm not God.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.800]   That is the heart of humility for created humans.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.600]   I'm not God, I'm under God.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.080]   1 Peter 5, 6, humble yourselves therefore
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.480]   under the mighty hand of God.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   Humility for us at its essence is what God cannot do.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.520]   He can't be humble like this.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   Namely, he cannot gladly say I'm not God, hooray.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.080]   God can't say that.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.560]   It would be the undoing of the universe.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.160]   But let's end like this,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.880]   'cause this is what he's really getting at.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.400]   And I think it's the right answer.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.040]   I was asked this question one time at an ETS meeting
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.800]   after I gave a big talk on God's pursuit of his own glory.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.720]   Somebody stood up and said,
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.240]   so there's no humility in God, right?
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.320]   And here's more or less what I said.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   Since perfect humility, that is perfect happy eagerness,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.720]   not to be God, but to trust God,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.280]   depend upon God, treasure God,
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.200]   that perfect humility is required of all human beings.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.920]   It was required of Adam, he failed.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.640]   It's required of us and we have failed.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.200]   Now, God loves such humility.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   It is in his nature to consider humility,
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.840]   human humility, a beautiful thing.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.960]   It's in his nature to delight in it.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   And he means to have it from his people whom he possesses
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.120]   and who will possess it, that kind of humility,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.000]   as his children forever.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.840]   So he does the unthinkable.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.960]   He takes on human nature.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.200]   The son of God becomes the God-man
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.160]   precisely to do what God as God cannot do.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.360]   Be perfectly humble in his human nature.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.000]   Christ perfectly trusted his father,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.480]   perfectly depended on his father.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.920]   And in his dependence,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.040]   he did what only a perfect human in union with God could do.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.360]   Philippians 2.8, being found in human form,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.680]   to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.040]   So here's my conclusion.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   God, considered absolutely as God, cannot be humble,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.160]   though he can be and is loving.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.880]   But the God-man in his perfect humanity
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.760]   could be humble and was, and in that sense,
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   has taken the beauty of humility into the Godhead
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.160]   for Christ, the God-man,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   will always be God and man forever.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.000]   - Amen, the mystery of mysteries, God become flesh,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.880]   Christ taking up human nature and thus taking up humility.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.600]   Well, there's a lot more to say here.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.680]   I'm reminded of episode 1111 in this podcast series.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.600]   It's one of my all-time favorites.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.920]   Is God a megalomaniac?
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   That's episode 1111,
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   and it maps onto what we're talking about here very nicely.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.520]   Thanks for listening.
