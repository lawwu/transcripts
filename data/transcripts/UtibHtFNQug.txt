[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   How do you start to move yourself
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.840]   towards more hopeful skepticism?
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.320]   - I want us to stop thinking like lawyers
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.640]   and start thinking, acting, and sharing like scientists.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.880]   And the theory underlying this
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.720]   is that hope is not sort of sunshine, roses,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.800]   it's not pie in the sky thinking,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.520]   that hope can be highly practical and data-driven.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.640]   Because of negativity bias, because of cynicism,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080]   most of us underestimate each other.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.880]   We don't realize how trustworthy, kind,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   compassionate, and open-minded most people are.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.840]   So we're missing all these opportunities.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840]   So how do we get them back?
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440]   Well, we need to not look away from problems,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.680]   but look more closely at problems
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.160]   and at the people around us.
