[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.880]   All right, let's jump in.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.640]   [Music]
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.400]   Light, thank you for being here.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.080]   Thanks, Chris. I'm excited, man.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.920]   I'm excited to be here on All The Hacks.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.440]   I want to start the conversation in the meditation arena
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.600]   because it's where I first came across you.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   And it seems like everyone I know, myself included,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.760]   have taken our own invitation to try meditation.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.080]   We've started it, and so few people I know have done it consistently.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.040]   And I think you have a little bit of a contrarian view here.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.400]   So let's just start.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.840]   What are people getting wrong when they think about starting meditating?
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.600]   Oh man, so many things.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.760]   Just a little context.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.800]   So I was considered...
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.160]   I consider myself to be a meditation dabbler for several years.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.240]   So I was one of those people.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.880]   You know, I would start and then I would stop for a long stretch of time
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.640]   and come back to it and pick it up again
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.360]   and then just do it for a week or two and then stop.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.000]   And then I met a teacher in Los Angeles in 2003
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.800]   who gave me what I now recognize as a more minimalist approach to meditation.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   And what I realized was that I was just doing way too much.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.400]   I was doing too much.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.040]   And that was one of the reasons why I was having so many clunky experiences.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280]   And I was labeling my mind as a monkey mind.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.400]   And so, I would say, you know, one of the biggest misconceptions
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.080]   is that you need to do all these things.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.640]   You need to let go of this and notice that
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.400]   and witness your thoughts like clouds in the sky
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.480]   and focus on your breath and vision the white light.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.800]   And you don't need to do any of that stuff.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   In fact, it works a lot better.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   And when I say better, I mean you have more delightful experiences
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   if you do less and then if you do least.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   And ultimately, if you can do nothing and just practice pure being,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   that's when it works the best.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.760]   So, I learned how to do that.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.120]   I learned how to operate in concert with my thinking mind.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880]   And that was a big game changer for me.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.000]   It literally made me an enthusiastic daily meditator within a couple of days.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.160]   And before that, I was probably one of the most reluctant meditators
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.720]   because I just felt like my mind was all over the place.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.080]   I was sitting there with my eyes closed, waiting for the time to pass.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.520]   My body was writhing in pain.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   It just felt like torture.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.960]   And then I went to feel like dessert.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   And it was amazing.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.720]   And I recognized that I wanted to be on this mission
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   to help introduce as many people as possible to this feeling.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.160]   You don't have to be somewhere laid out with the eye mask on
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.520]   in the middle of nowhere.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.480]   You can - it's like you bring that serenity from that experience wherever you are.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720]   So, you can have that experience in the back of an Uber.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.480]   You can have it on an airplane.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.800]   You could have it in your aunt's living room.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.040]   You can have it in your office chair.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.360]   Wherever you happen to be sitting and you have the ability to close your eyes
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.800]   for 10 or 15 minutes, you can drop right into that experience.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.440]   And that's the power of that shift I experienced in meditation.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.360]   And I'm just - I'm excited to introduce as many people as possible to that.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.280]   And all the books I've written have been about exposing those misconceptions.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.440]   And my most recent book, Travel Light, same thing.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.240]   It's just like - it's bare bones, minimalist approach, stripping away things that are -
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.960]   that I consider to be unnecessary for having that particular experience.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.800]   -And what does the science say?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.960]   When you strip all that stuff away, do you have the same impact on your life
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.760]   and the same outcomes?
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.280]   -You know, it's interesting.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.640]   The science actually - there's been a lot of people studying meditation recently, okay?
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.600]   The godfather of meditation research is this guy named Dr. Herbert Benson.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.920]   He's a Harvard cardiologist.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   He studied the stress response for many, many years.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.440]   He was one of Walter Cannon's protégés.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.120]   Walter Cannon was the professor who coined the term fight-flight reaction at Harvard.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.320]   And Benson was tracked down by these meditators from the local Cambridge
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   Transcendental Meditation Center because no one had ever really studied it properly.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   And this is like in the late 1960s, early 1970s.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.240]   And he dismissed them.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.000]   He said, "No, I'm not studying you guys."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.760]   Because back then, studying something like meditation would be akin to, you know,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   studying spirit animals now.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   Like, no serious professor is going to bring in people who claim to have a spirit animal
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.680]   into the laboratory and study them.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.560]   But they kept coming back.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.600]   They were persistent.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.440]   And eventually, he figured he had nothing to lose.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   And when he connected them to all the different measuring devices,
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.600]   he was shocked by what he saw.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.000]   He basically - again, this is somebody who was probably one of the world's experts
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.520]   in the fight-or-flight reaction.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.560]   He saw that everything that happens in the fight-or-flight reaction goes in the opposite
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.720]   direction during what he later coined as the relaxation response.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.600]   He's the one that came up with the term relaxation response.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.040]   He wrote a New York Times best-selling book about the effects of meditation
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.520]   called The Relaxation Response.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.240]   And the reason why his research is relevant to this day is because back then,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.840]   they could test anything they wanted to.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   Nowadays, you can only test one or two things.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.560]   And there's got to be time apart.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.480]   And you can't, you know, stick rectal thermometers up in the people
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.080]   and do all these kind of invasive measurements.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.360]   Well, he was able to do everything.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.880]   It was completely unrestricted.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.320]   It was free range back then.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:32.480]   And so, he's got the most thorough results of anyone who's ever tested meditation.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.560]   And so, the relaxation response, according to his research, gets triggered by three things,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   basically, three essential things.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.680]   Number one, you have to be sitting comfortably, comfortably, right?
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.840]   So, we think about meditation and we think about it as someone sitting with their what?
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.240]   Back straight, shoulders back, chin up.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.960]   Ideally, with your legs crossed, maybe even with your fingers together.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.640]   That's the sort of classical posture for meditation.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.520]   But to trigger this response that he saw where you go in the opposite direction of the fight flight,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.840]   you have to actually sit with back support.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.360]   You don't need to cross your legs.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.960]   You don't need to hold your shoulders back.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.400]   Even your chin can be dropping forward as though it looks like you're falling asleep,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.920]   but that's not actually what's happening.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:32.080]   Then he said you need a passive attitude, passive attitude, which means the opposite of focus.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.800]   Focus is an active attitude.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.200]   You're trying to exclude experiences.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.520]   You're trying to exclude the noise, the distracting thoughts, the distracting sensations, right?
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.000]   And you're supposed to be thinking about the fact that you're meditating.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.120]   Well, he said don't do that.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.680]   Just let whatever your mind is thinking about come into the experience.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:02.480]   And then third, you want some sort of anchor point to come back to, whether it's your breath,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.000]   whether it's a mantra, whether it's a word, a sound, something that's actually soothing to you,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.720]   something that is sort of like your happy word or anchor.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.240]   And if you have the combination of those three things,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.400]   you can have the most profound experiences in the meditation.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.320]   And then if you continue exposing yourself to this state,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.000]   this relaxation response over and over and over, eventually you can stabilize it.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.600]   Your body can stabilize it.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   So, this is another thing, another misconception that people have about meditation is that
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.240]   I can just meditate every now and again and I'll still get the benefits from it,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.520]   but it doesn't work like that.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.760]   It's not - it's kind of like working out, right?
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   Let's say you just worked out on Tuesdays and Saturdays.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.360]   Are you going to get as strong working out twice a week as you would get working out
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.920]   five times a week, right?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.280]   It's still beneficial to work out twice a week versus not at all,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.920]   but if you want to stabilize the strength, if you want to cultivate it so that it's there
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.880]   all the time, you need to do it more often and the same applies to meditation.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.440]   It needs to be a daily practice and that's because the main thing that's keeping you from feeling
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.640]   fulfilled, happy, content, peaceful, that thing isn't taking any days off and that is the stress.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.320]   The stress is coming in every day.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.880]   The stress is like, you know, P90X or something.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.280]   It's like working on you every day.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:40.320]   So, in order to counterbalance that, you need to do the thing that is like kryptonite distress,
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.480]   which is the meditation because the meditation supplies the body with biochemicals that can
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.440]   dissolve the stress.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   You need to do that every day.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.920]   So, I think for some people listening, the idea of, "Oh man, so if I want to get started with
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.720]   this, I need to commit to a daily practice forever," can be daunting.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.600]   But I know, you know, when you wrote Bliss More,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.960]   you talked about how you could succeed in meditation without really trying.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.280]   So, how can we break this down for someone that maybe feels like what you just said
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.800]   is overwhelming and will take a lot of work and maybe realize that it doesn't have to be that hard?
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.040]   Yeah, and I would go further and say it shouldn't be that.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.280]   You're not going to do it if it feels hard to do.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.720]   We don't do things as humans.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.760]   We don't do anything that's hard to do on a consistent basis.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.640]   So, we have to get meditation out of the chore category.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   It's out of the "I have to" category into the "I get to" category.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.560]   Because last time I checked, people who are chain smokers don't have - they don't need
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.000]   any willpower to smoke a cigarette.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.160]   Coffee drinkers don't need any willpower to drink a cup of coffee in the morning.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.480]   Sugar addicts don't need a willpower to eat that muffin in the morning, right?
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.960]   They get up and they are craving those experiences because they have conditioned their body
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.880]   to become effectively addicted to those experiences.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   And guess what?
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.040]   Meditation can get there as well.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:15.440]   So, in order to get there, you have to learn how to do it in a way that feels legitimately
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.200]   enjoyable.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.600]   Not that you're faking like it feels enjoyable.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.560]   It has to literally feel like it's enjoyable.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.920]   And there's like a couple of things that people do to spoil the experience.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   And one of those things is they treat their mind like a monkey mind.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.280]   You know that term "monkey mind"?
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.560]   Which implies that your mind is exceptionally busy, right?
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.160]   Now, I don't want to negate the idea that you have lots of thoughts.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.520]   I believe you when you say that your mind is very busy.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.240]   Because guess what?
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.560]   Everybody's mind is busy.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.640]   My mind is busy.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.160]   My mind has all kinds of thoughts.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   The problem is we think it's not supposed to happen.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.680]   We think that our mind is supposed to just automatically stop having all these thoughts
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.360]   the moment we close our eyes.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.400]   And that's not the case.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:19.120]   The mind is going to have thoughts in the same way that the ocean is going to be wavy.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.480]   Water is wavy and the mind thinks.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:31.280]   And so, what we need to do is understand how to move around in concert with the thinking
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.600]   mind during meditation in the same way that you learn how to swim.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.760]   When you learn how to swim, the wavy water is no longer an issue.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.360]   In fact, it's quite enjoyable.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.120]   If you don't know how to swim, then it's a nightmare.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.400]   The water is a nightmare.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.720]   The same water that someone else is enjoying for you is a nightmare.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.120]   Because it's going to potentially drown you.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.080]   And guess what?
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.560]   You increase the chances of the water drowning you by doing too much.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.400]   The person who knows how to swim does less and they can just like actually float there
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.520]   by doing nothing.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.640]   By doing nothing, the water will actually support you.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.760]   You'll float.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.960]   By trying to move and fight the water, you drown yourself.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.160]   Same is true with the mind.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.440]   By doing too much, the thoughts start to drown you.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.360]   By doing less, you can actually move through your mind in a very gradual way.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.520]   And the more you can embrace the thinking mind, and in fact, you can get to the point
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.680]   where you're celebrating it.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.520]   And what I mean by that is not that you're sitting there imagining yourself at a mind
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.760]   party or anything like that, but you're just understanding that this is a legitimate part
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.480]   of the experience.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.200]   And it's a necessary part in order for you to reach that state of depth that you ultimately
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.320]   want to get to.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.800]   And what you'll find is that by adopting this added - this genuine attitude of nonchalance,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.640]   the thoughts start to become fewer and fewer, the mind settles more and more, and eventually
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:11.120]   you can drop into a state where you're no longer aware that you're even thinking.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:18.480]   And now, when you're in that state, literally, there's no awareness.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.600]   So, you never know you're there while you're there, because thinking that, "Oh, I'm here,"
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.880]   that means you're not there.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.840]   You're not there anymore.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:35.680]   So, it's through this mechanism of using your nonchalant attitude to kind of steer your
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.960]   way back into that state, you keep losing awareness.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.240]   And I'll give you an experience - for people who think, "Oh, no, that's not possible."
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.160]   I'll give you an experience that you've already had to show you that it is indeed
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.800]   possible because you've already experienced it, okay?
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:55.200]   Everybody has had the experience of sitting on their couch or sitting on their bed and
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   it's late at night and you're trying to read a book or you're trying to watch a television
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.520]   show.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:08.080]   And then time goes by and you're stuck on this one line in the book or large portions
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.320]   of the show have passed and you don't remember what happened, right?
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.040]   There was a gap in your awareness, but you don't remember sleeping.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.120]   You also don't remember reading or watching the show.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.880]   So, where were you?
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:33.920]   You were in this other state and that loss of awareness is symptomatic of a transition
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.040]   of consciousness.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.680]   You're actually about to move away from your waking consciousness, which is where
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.920]   you were aware of what you're reading, into your sleeping consciousness.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.400]   And anytime there's a shift in your consciousness state, there's a loss of awareness.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   And that relaxation response that I referred to earlier, Herbert Benson's work, he identified
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.040]   that as a fourth state of consciousness.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.600]   So, there's the sleeping state, which we all have, the dreaming state, the waking state,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.560]   and now we have the meditation state, the fourth state.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.840]   And so, when you're going into the fourth state, there's a loss of awareness and it's
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.240]   consistent with the same thing you experience going from waking to dreaming to sleeping
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.200]   and back to waking.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.240]   -Okay.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.080]   So, with that example, I can recall a situation like that as recently as I think last night.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.880]   For me, it's if I'm really tired and I'm reading my daughter a book, every now and
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.120]   then, I'll notice that I just read a line of the book that wasn't in the book.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.400]   I just made something random up and I non-intentionally and I'm like, "I don't know
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.200]   where that came from."
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.880]   Obviously, I wasn't sleeping because I was reading, but I didn't read what was on the
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.200]   page.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.960]   Okay.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.680]   So, you've sold me.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.320]   What process would you walk someone through or method to try this out?
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.560]   If someone listening is like, "Okay, can I start this?"
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.320]   -It's not too dissimilar from what Herbert Benson described.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.160]   You sit comfortably, you close your eyes.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.200]   And when I say sit comfortably, I mean sitting upright.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.160]   You can lean back on something, but you need to sit.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.080]   This is not a practice you do lying down.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.800]   You sit upright, you're comfortable, you lean back on something for back support, you close
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.640]   your eyes and immediately, you're going to get hit with a wave of thoughts.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.080]   Now, you're in the water, okay?
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.200]   If you just treat your thoughts like you're in water and the idea is not to fight the
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.080]   thoughts at all, not even a little bit.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.880]   Don't judge them, don't shame yourself for having them.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.480]   Don't think that you have too many or too little or anything like that.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.720]   Just - it's just like just going into water and you know, sometimes it's a little bit
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.640]   cold or it's warm or it's a little choppy or it's - there's an undercurrent.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.400]   You know, you just - you may notice the quality of the thoughts, but you're not even trying
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:00.960]   to do that.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:09.200]   It's just a - it's just a natural inclination when we are moving into a body of water, right?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.400]   So, same thing with meditation.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:16.320]   You may notice the texture of your thoughts or the color or the - you know, the quality
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.640]   of the thoughts, but it's - there's no judgment around the idea that you're in this body of
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.480]   thinking and you give yourself some time to just kind of acclimate, right?
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.000]   Eyes closed and then you just start to literally do less.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.600]   You start to literally do less.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:42.640]   You start to just shift away from the tendency to control the experience which is what we
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.040]   all have in the beginning to this idea that "okay, well, I'm just going to enjoy it
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.560]   for whatever it is.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.000]   I don't have any expectation, I don't have any anticipation of any kind of result".
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:00.640]   And you have some sort of timing device that you're using to track how much time has gone
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.760]   by and whatever you said you were going to sit for 10 minutes or 15 minutes, you just
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.000]   have that experience and then keep, you know, peeking at the clock whenever you are curious
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.040]   about the clock.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.600]   No judgment around how much time is passing and then eventually you'll see that 10 or
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.080]   15 minutes have passed and then you slowly come out.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.760]   And I mean, I break all this down in my book Travel Light, there's a whole 10-step process
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.480]   but that's essentially what it is.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.600]   If you want to use your breathing as a sort of anchor point to come back to if you are
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.720]   aware that you're meditating but you were just thinking about taxes or you're just thinking
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.440]   about dinner or something like that, you can come back to your breathing.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.000]   But guess what?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.600]   You're going to go right back to your dinner thoughts or your to-do list and that's fine
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:45.840]   too.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   You don't have to - it's not about trying to keep that stuff away, it's about seeing
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.520]   that all is a part of the experience.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.360]   So, most of it is just your attitude really at the end of the day.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.840]   You know, let's say you're sitting down, you're thinking dinner, "Oh, what am I going
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.800]   to make for dinner?"
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.760]   Would you try to encourage someone to maybe say, "I can think about that later" or just
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.240]   think about it.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.360]   Think what you're going to make for dinner, you know, make the mental grocery list of
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.600]   what you need to buy or acknowledge that you're having that thought and that you can come
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.160]   back to it.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.040]   So, here's - okay, this is an interesting point.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:23.440]   When you say come back to it, right, where are you going to go when you say come back
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:23.760]   to it?
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.960]   Okay, I'm going to come back to this thought.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.680]   Where are you going to go?
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.760]   Some other thought about something else.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.880]   So, you may as well just indulge yourself.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.480]   This is a practice of indulgence.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.600]   Indulge yourself in whatever's happening and just know that you can't screw it up really.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.720]   So, the more you practice this, this lack of resistance, the deeper you will set yourself
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.000]   up to go in the meditation.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.160]   And eventually, again, as you go deeper, just like when you're reading the book to your
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.200]   child, you're never going to know the part where you drop off the abyss and you lose
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.840]   that awareness.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.320]   And if you look for it, it's not going to happen.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.760]   You're sitting there going, "Okay, I want to lose awareness now.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.880]   When am I going to lose awareness?
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.320]   I can't wait to lose awareness".
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.240]   You're going to be aware the whole time.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.360]   So, you legitimately want to be just indulgent in whatever you're thinking about and then
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.880]   without even realizing it, you'll drop off, the time will start going by faster and the
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.720]   experience will feel really good.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.480]   And you'll be one of those meditators that you don't want the time to end.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.400]   Now, the beauty of that is when you come out, guess what?
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:37.360]   You'll have a more orderly thinking because the mind has this beautiful way of organizing
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.680]   the things that are most important, second most important, third most important.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.600]   You'll start to make connections between things that seem to be unrelated.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:55.120]   You'll start to spot themes in your life which will allow you to then prioritize what you
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.600]   should be doing now versus what you thought you should have been doing.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.720]   For instance, you know, "Oh, is it more important to send this email right now or
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.120]   is it more important to spend time with my kid reading my story?"
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.640]   A lot of people are confused about that and a lot of people may say, "Oh, the email is
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   more important or spending time with my kid is more important", right?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.400]   And it's not to say that spending time with your kid is always the most important thing.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.560]   Sometimes I could imagine scenarios where sending that email is more important or you
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.720]   won't have a house to read - to read a story to your kids.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.440]   So, you know, but you have to be able to discern that without putting too much thought into
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:39.920]   it because as I talk about in Travel Light, the heart voice is your internal GPS that
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.600]   a lot of times we'll hear but we'll ignore in ways that we would never ignore our actual
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.560]   GPS in our phones when we're trying to get somewhere.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.480]   You know, you'd be ridiculous to ignore it.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.960]   Every now and again we do it because it just - no, this can't be the right turn.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.880]   We ignore it and then what does it do?
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.000]   It reroutes so that we still end up at the destination, we just take a little bit of
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.840]   a scenic route and so, the heart voice does the same thing.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.760]   You can't really screw up, you just end up taking the scenic route sometimes.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.280]   But it'll always guide you on what to do next if you're listening to it.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.120]   -Any tips for kind of paying attention to it or prioritizing it?
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.600]   I think sometimes we all know what we want to be doing and we're not doing it.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:28.400]   In the book, I liken this to sports, like a basketball arena, right?
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.280]   So, you have the players on the floor, that's you and then you have all of the fans and
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.320]   those are the voices in your head and so, the heart voice which is also known as the
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.160]   still small voice, the heart voice is usually up in the nosebleeds and down on the floor
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.720]   seats, you have the fear voice, the voice of social conditioning, the voice of your
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.040]   parents and teachers and coaches, the news, right?
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.800]   All the voices that you've listened to the most in your life and so, those are the voices
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.720]   that the player, you would hear the loudest in your awareness, not even just in meditation
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.320]   but in life in general.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.600]   And the still small voice, they're shouting as loud as they can but you can barely hear
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.320]   them just because of proximity, it's so far away because we haven't been listening to
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.920]   that still small voice.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   The still small voice is the one that's telling us to do the right thing, to stop looking
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:29.280]   for shortcuts, to take the extra - go the extra mile, right?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.360]   Somebody said there's never a traffic jam on the extra mile because so few people take
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:42.160]   it and it's basically reminding us that there is no way to happiness, happiness is a way.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.760]   All the cliches, give what you want to receive, there's no throwaway moments in life, all
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.680]   these cliches, that's what the still small voice is reminding us of always.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:00.000]   And when we start listening to it more and more and acting upon it, then effectively
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.040]   we move them out of the nosebleeds and down to the floor seats and that's where we want
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   them to be.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:12.000]   We don't want them to be a still small voice, we want them to be a loud annoying voice like
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.080]   the floor seat people because that way it's harder to ignore it.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.520]   And what you'll find is the more you listen to it, A, it's going to take you out of your
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.640]   comfort zone more often than not, but you're always going to be at the right place and
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.040]   at the right time for you.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:35.200]   And you know, everything that's wonderful in your life, the best stories you have usually
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.680]   are describing moments where you listen to that voice, where something told you to dot
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   dot dot and you did it and this amazing thing happened and that's the thing you now talk
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:52.040]   about on podcasts and you write about in your books and you make movies and songs and choreographed
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.400]   dances about because that's what the heart does.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   It always takes us on this little adventure, whereas not listening to the heart is what
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   creates drama.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:06.120]   So, you're either creating adventure in your life by listening to it or you're creating
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.360]   drama in your life by ignoring it.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.920]   There is no neutral path, it's either adventure or drama.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.360]   And if you look at drama, you could always reverse engineer it back to a moment where
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.280]   you ignore your heart.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   Interesting.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.120]   I know one other thing you've talked about, just finding ways to create more of those
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.440]   moments where they become stories you tell, it's just being more present.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.040]   Any tricks for either being more present or, you know, kind of getting other people you're
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.840]   around to also do that?
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.180]   Good luck with that.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.180]   Let's start with you.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.200]   It's hard enough to get you present.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:51.400]   But no, the one hack I would use for getting present is you have to become radically grateful.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.800]   Become radically grateful.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:00.440]   And what I mean by that is you have to be really intentional about finding as many things
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.120]   as possible that you can be grateful for in this moment.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.820]   There's this guy named Brad Lee, he's big on social media and he says - he uses this
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.060]   one example that I just love.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:21.420]   He says, you know, if I were to give you $10 million just as a gift, how would you feel
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.420]   about that?
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.420]   If I just gave you $10 million?
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.620]   And then, of course, the person he's talking to says, "I feel amazing, that'd be great
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.160]   if I had $10 million".
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.620]   What if there was a catch?
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.640]   And one catch is you can't wake up tomorrow.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.700]   Would you still be excited about that $10 million?
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.700]   Would you still take it?
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.700]   And everyone would say, "No, I wouldn't take it.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.180]   If I couldn't wake up tomorrow, no".
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:49.300]   He says, "So, what you're saying is just by waking up, it's the equivalent of someone
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.420]   giving you $10 million".
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:57.300]   So, when you wake up in the morning, are you grateful like somebody just gave you $10 million?
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.020]   Obviously, the answer is no.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.580]   we take that for granted. But if we ran that thought experiment, we'd all say the same
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.060]   thing. We'd love to have $10 million, but not if it means we can't wake up in the morning.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:14.020]   So, right off the bat, that's something you can be grateful for. I woke up today. I woke
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:19.340]   up today, I have all these opportunities, all these possibilities. I can breathe, I
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:26.300]   can taste, I can smell, I can see, I can feel, I can walk, I can run. You know, you can just
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:31.420]   go down the list and just start thinking of all the things that you're grateful for.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.380]   I saw a guy here in Mexico City the other day. I was just walking down the street with
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:40.300]   a buddy of mine. This guy was on crutches and he was tethered to this dolly where he
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.140]   was carrying all this crap. It's like a homeless guy in the middle of the street, stumbling
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:51.420]   his way down the street. And one of his legs was like disfigured. I was like, man, that
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.860]   guy would give anything to just be able to walk normally, you know, and not have to rely
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.820]   on these crutches. And here we are walking, just completely taking it for granted. And
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.700]   I just dropped into gratitude in that moment. So, you know, if you can't see it for yourself,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.620]   when you see other people who don't have the same blessings that you have, hopefully, you
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.140]   know, use that as an opportunity to remind yourself how blessed you are. If you're huffing
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.060]   and puffing because the elevator's out and you just walked up three flights of stairs,
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.100]   there's somebody out there that would give - that's not that far away from you right
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.940]   now that would give anything to be able to walk up those three flights of stairs, right?
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:33.160]   If your television is not working because the cable's out, but you can see there's somebody
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.260]   out there that's not far from you that would give anything to be able to see that the television
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.860]   doesn't work. So, you know, just radically dropping into gratitude will get you right
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.180]   into that present moment. And then from the present moment, you'll be able to see other
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.140]   things, other opportunities that are hiding all around you. And it's kind of like those
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.660]   magic eye puzzles, you know, those magic eye puzzles, those patterns -
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.180]   I was never good at those.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:00.740]   Yeah, some people aren't because you're always trying to find the thing. But if you just
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.900]   surrender to it and you just allow it to be as chaotic as it wants to be without trying
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:12.300]   to control it, that's the condition that needs to happen. It's not that it's a suggestion,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.500]   it needs to happen in order for the image to be revealed. And so, life can be like that
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.860]   too. The more you surrender to what is happening instead of playing the woulda coulda shoulda
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:27.460]   game and that again, that's presence. That's a foundation of presence. You'll start to
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:37.220]   see things and feel things that other people would not have an easy time seeing or experiencing
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.820]   because you really have to be connected to that moment in order to have that download,
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.980]   to have that epiphany.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:51.020]   And then every moment becomes special and sentimental, right? And it's not just the
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:56.860]   old china set that your auntie's grandmother passed down, you know, sitting in the drawer
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.780]   somewhere collecting dust. Everything is sentimental, just like that china set is sentimental because
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:09.820]   you're present. So, there's a relationship between presence and feeling that sense of
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.140]   connection with all of the things that are around you and that way, everything is special.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.060]   And that doesn't mean you can't also have huge, big, ambitious projects at work and
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.860]   be excited and you just need to live in the moment and just accept that everything is
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.860]   what it is, right?
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.620]   All right. So, I'll give you the difference in those two experiences. There's two kinds
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   of people out in the world, okay? There's people who are looking for happiness on the
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:41.220]   other side of that project and there are people who are engaging in that project because they
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.980]   feel a sense of happiness inside, because they feel a sense of fulfillment inside. So,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:52.380]   they're informed by where to put that attention next. And that project seems like a perfect
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:58.260]   outlet for what they already have. In other words, they're not looking to get happier
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.860]   on the yonder side of that achievement.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:08.660]   And that's a big mistake that we oftentimes make is we think that the project or the achievement
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:17.180]   is going to lead to happiness. And so, we'll indulge ourselves in this project a lot of
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:22.380]   times at the expense of our health, at the expense of our relationships, at the expense
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.260]   of our connection to family because we think that, "Oh, I'm going to make all this money
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.700]   and then everybody's going to be happy once I become a multi-millionaire". And oftentimes
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:38.460]   the opposite happens, right? Starting with you, you're not any - if that was true that
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:44.300]   achieving things will make you happier in a lasting way, then think about it. You would
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.060]   still be as happy as you were the day you walked across the stage to get your high school
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.380]   diploma. Remember that day, how happy you were? And the day you got your first real
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.940]   job and the day you got the promotion and the day you got your Tesla and the day you
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.180]   moved into the nice house, right? There were these spikes of dopamine and joy and serotonin.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.860]   But then after a week or two or a month, you settled back into wherever you were before
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.420]   you achieve the thing. And that's kind of how it goes.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:21.580]   And so, the whole spiritual perspective is that happiness is not found outside through
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:28.300]   experience, it's found inside through cultivating it with your inner work. Practices like meditation,
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.380]   practices like gratitude, feeling more present, more in the moment. And if you do that, then
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.980]   not only are you going to have the spike of joy, but it's going to become stable at some
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:44.460]   point and it increases the baseline level of fulfillment, contentedness, peace and joy.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:52.780]   And the way you know it's happening is that you need less and less to feel content. You're
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:34:00.380]   able to let go of control more and more to be present. And so, yeah, that's where you
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.860]   start to shift in the why, why you're doing the things that you're doing. It's not to
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.700]   try to get happy, it's because you're happy. That's why you took this job. That's why you
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.020]   dated this person. That's why you're engaging in this particular project.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.820]   And everybody else on the outside may not understand, why did you give up being an investment
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:29.100]   banker to work at a homeless shelter, right? That's what felt aligned with the happiness
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:36.420]   that I have inside. And that's how I wanted to contribute. And so, you were feeling like
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.100]   your soul was being sucked at the investment banking situation and in the homeless shelter,
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:48.140]   you're lit up inside. And then what ends up happening is because you're so engaged and
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:55.060]   present in that homeless shelter position, somebody notices. And then they tap you to
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:02.180]   become the head of social workers in that city and then in that district and then in
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.540]   that state. And then next thing you know, you're on some panel in the White House, helping
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:14.700]   to engineer legislation around that work because you're the one that's obviously so engaged
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:20.300]   in it. And that took a leap of faith away from something that you thought was the higher
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:25.500]   paying job, but actually compared to how it was making you feel inside, it was the lower
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:32.860]   paying job. And the surface level lower paying job was actually the higher paying job because
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:39.940]   it lit you up more. And then it ultimately manifested in you making five times more because
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:44.600]   now you're a thought leader in that space. You're on the keynote circuit, you're writing
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.340]   books about it because you are so passionate about that work. And that's what we need to
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.880]   understand is that, again, the heart is already guiding you, but it's always going to take
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.500]   you out of your comfort zone and into your growth zone. And that's exactly where you
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   want to be because that's where you need to be in order to stretch into the potential
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.100]   to fulfill that vision that you have for yourself.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:11.540]   Yeah. I've even found that maybe the role at the homeless shelter in this example doesn't
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:16.700]   turn into the thing at the White House that's so much more lucrative for you. But maybe
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.180]   it puts you in the right state of mind to find another project that you start that becomes
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:27.960]   that. And so, I spent a lot of time talking about money, and there's this whole financial
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.860]   independence retire early movement. And what I've seen is that people who end up saving
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.620]   up enough money to retire thinking they're never going to do anything, end up spending
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:41.680]   their time on things they love, and then creating these second careers, which actually meant
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.900]   they probably could have "retired" per se, in quotes, a lot earlier.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.720]   Because when you have the time and space to find things you're excited about and only
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:57.180]   work on those, very often, not always, but very often, they end up turning into things
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.580]   that can support you and your family in ways that you probably didn't imagine beforehand.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:08.140]   Yeah, 100%, man. And all roads lead to Rome. All roads lead to your purpose. You can't
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.340]   screw it up, actually. So, even if you stay in that investment banking job long enough,
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.780]   eventually it'll become so painful if it's not aligned. What I mean is if it's not aligned,
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:23.060]   sometimes it is aligned. And you end up, again, like somebody like Jamie Dimon, and you're
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:28.700]   creating policy or at least influencing policy that could be bringing economic empowerment
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.980]   to certain communities and things like that. Or you're writing about it, or you're speaking
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:39.660]   about it. But either way, you can't really go wrong as long as you're... My work is all
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:45.240]   about just awareness, bringing more awareness to doing the things that you're doing and
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.460]   checking in and seeing if this feels aligned.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.980]   Because I want you - I want all the listeners to have the adventurous route. I don't want
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.260]   you having the dramatic - I don't want you being in a hospital and you can't use half
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.860]   your body because you stayed in it too long and then it manifested physically. And even
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:07.060]   that's a part of your purpose. Maybe you'll end up writing about that, right? But that's
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.220]   just a more - it's not the more enjoyable path. The more enjoyable path is the path
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:18.300]   of the unknown, where you're choosing this consciously. You're choosing, "I'm gonna leave
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.340]   this and I'm gonna do this other thing because it lights me up inside. I don't know how it's
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:29.220]   gonna turn out, but I'm trusting that it's going to lead me somewhere that is gonna allow
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:36.860]   me to become more useful. So, if retiring early lights me up inside, then that's gonna
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:42.180]   lead me somewhere that's gonna allow me to become more useful. If continuing to work
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.300]   lights me up inside, then that's gonna lead me somewhere. You know, if you're like the
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.660]   Picasso where, you know, Picasso isn't thinking about retiring from painting because he loves
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:55.580]   it so much. So, if your work is so close to your heart in that way, you're not thinking
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:59.100]   about "when am I going to retire", right? All you're thinking about is "when can I go
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:05.620]   and keep creating and keep finding solutions". So, whatever path you're on, you're gonna
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:12.700]   get to the - you're gonna eventually arrive at the awareness that you've been on your
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.460]   purpose the entire time and everything was preparing you.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.420]   - And what would you say to someone who's like, "Gosh, I know I'm not in the right thing,
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.380]   but I don't know what the alternative is". You know, they hate the investment banking
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.500]   job but they don't have an alternative right now. They don't have the thing that lights
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   them up.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:35.180]   - So, I'll tell you what they do have though, they have curiosity about something. And the
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:41.860]   reason why they may dismiss it is because it doesn't make sense. It doesn't align with
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.940]   whatever they think their thing is. And I'll give you an example about this, okay? So,
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.580]   I remember one time I was teaching meditation, which I've been doing for 15 plus years now.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:59.220]   I was teaching meditation in New York City, staying at an Airbnb. And I'm thinking, you
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:03.080]   know, it's my dream job and I just want to get as many people as possible into these
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:11.460]   meditation trainings and expose people to this knowledge. So, I'm walking through Union
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:16.840]   Square one night, which is in the middle of Manhattan on my way back to my apartment after
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:23.340]   teaching a class. Something tells me to go to Barnes and Noble, which is at the north
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:30.420]   end of the Union Square and to get a Rubik's cube and to learn how to solve it just out
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:38.560]   of the blue. Like again, it's 9.45 at night, I get this intuitive hit. And immediately
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.460]   I started thinking, well, it's almost 10 o'clock, they're probably closed, I'm kind of tired,
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.460]   just want to go home. But again, I had been doing so much inner work that my still small
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:53.120]   voice now became the loud, annoying voice. It was like, "Get your ass up in Barnes and
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.340]   Noble right now, get that Rubik's cube, hurry up before they close." So, I'm like, "Okay,
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.980]   cool." So, I go and I get the Rubik's cube because I spent a lot of time in that Barnes
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.740]   and Noble. So, I knew where the toy section was and they had one Rubik's cube left. I
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:11.700]   paid for it. I was like the last person in the checkout lane before they closed. And
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:16.620]   I get home and my friend calls. This is my friend who - I talk to him about money and
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:22.060]   all that all the time and business strategy. And he goes, "What are you doing?" And I said,
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.500]   "I just got a Rubik's cube and I'm learning how to solve it." He goes, "What?" I said,
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.420]   "Yeah, I got a Rubik's cube." He goes, "What are you doing playing with the Rubik's cube?"
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.260]   And he starts giving me all this litany of reasons why I need to put the Rubik's cube
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:38.740]   aside and spend that energy on more productive things.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:46.340]   So, this isn't the first time I've bewildered my friends with my weird quirky, you know,
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:52.940]   interests. So, I just kind of ignored it and I went on Google and I researched how do you
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:58.900]   solve a Rubik's cube? I had no idea. Turns out there's an algorithm to solving the Rubik's
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:04.220]   cube. And you just have to memorize this sequence and you can solve a cube. I thought you had
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.820]   to be a genius to solve a Rubik's cube. It turns out that's not how it works. So, I started
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.900]   going through the sequence and mastering the turns and it took me about three days to finally
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.700]   learn how to solve the Rubik's cube within a few minutes, which is the most amazing thing.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.060]   If you're ever on a New York subway and you pull out a Rubik's cube and you start solving
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.380]   it, it's incredible. People are like gawking at you because they think you're a genius,
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.900]   but you're not a genius. You just learned the sequence.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.440]   So anyways, I'm bringing this Rubik's cube with me everywhere I go now because it's like
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:42.980]   a little party trick. And then it dawns on me one day that the way you solve a Rubik's
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.620]   cube, which is how everybody solves it, you solve it in rows. You start with the bottom
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.420]   row, the middle row and the top row, and then you do some more turns and the whole thing
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:43:00.820]   gets solved. The way that works is very similar to the way meditation works. It works in essentially
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:08.860]   in levels. So, the base level is like rest gets restored and then from there, your immune
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:15.280]   system comes back online and then your reproduction system comes back online and then your hormonal
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.340]   balancing system, the endocrine system comes back online, et cetera.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:24.060]   And then the whole thing comes back into balance. And I was like, man, this is - I never would
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:29.360]   have guessed that there was a connection between a Rubik's cube and meditation. I was so curious
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:36.220]   about it that I decided to make a video. This is back in like 2006 or 7. So, there was this
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.340]   new website, newish website, YouTube. And I was like, I'm going to do a YouTube video,
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:46.600]   my first YouTube video. And I got my point and shoot camera, there were no smartphones.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:51.820]   And I turned my living room in Venice, California into like a little makeshift studio. I was
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.940]   like setting it up on shoe boxes and stuff. And I created this video where I demonstrated
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:05.020]   solving the Rubik's cube and then I had to learn how to put captions over it. And that
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:11.740]   video, I uploaded it, it went viral. And people in the meditation community started sharing
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:18.180]   it like wildfire. And guess what? More people came to learn meditation.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:26.240]   The thing that I wanted ultimately, my heart voice knew that that's what I wanted and it
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:32.660]   took me on this really beautiful adventurous path to get the result that I was after, that
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:37.180]   I never could have imagined in a million years. The first step was to take your ass in Barnes
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:41.340]   and Noble and get that thing, get that Rubik's cube. And then spend a few days learning how
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.940]   to solve it and then use it as a party trick and then figure out how to make a YouTube
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.140]   video, figure out how to do captions, iMovie, you know.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:55.060]   So, the whole path took a lot of work. It took a lot of focus. It took a lot of saying
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:03.460]   no to things because I was working so intently on this project. But the end result was I
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:11.020]   had this thing that was now driving people to learn how to meditate. And that's how curiosity
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.780]   works. You never know where it's going to lead to. You just trust that if it's genuine
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.900]   and it's sincere and your intentions are good and you follow through with it and it's not
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:25.940]   harming anybody, it's going to lead you to the place that you've always envisioned for
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.500]   yourself but in the most unpredictable and amazing way possible.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.380]   So, the answer I guess is if you don't know what you should be doing, just follow the
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.980]   curiosity and see where it goes.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.780]   Follow the curiosity. That's the gateway to your purpose. I say in the book, you don't
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.020]   have to ever worry about your purpose, just follow your curiosity and your purpose will
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.020]   find you.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.020]   I love that.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   That's the hack.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.020]   In many ways.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.500]   That's the hack to finding your purpose is follow your curiosity relentlessly.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.500]   No judgment.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   Just see where it takes you.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.900]   Well, you mentioned meditation a few times and it brought me back to a few questions
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:03.660]   I didn't ask and I want to come back to because I think it's important. I know a lot of people
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.380]   are thinking there's a lot of things I could do to make my life better. I could start eating
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.340]   better. I could start exercising. I could be sleeping better. So, I've got two questions.
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:17.180]   One is how would you weigh those things, right? If someone's trying to decide they're not
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:23.300]   exercising now, they're not meditating, they're not sleeping well, maybe they're not - all
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.780]   these things. How would you prioritize which one is the higher order impact on your life?
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.980]   That's a great question. Okay. So, here's how you want to look at it. You need a key
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:42.580]   habit. You need a key habit, okay? So, let's say you choose exercise. You decide I'm going
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:49.700]   to go to the gym, you know, like clockwork every day. Is going to the gym going to make
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:57.500]   you want to be kinder to your family? Maybe, maybe not. Is going to the gym going to make
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:03.700]   you want to sit down and meditate? Maybe not more than you did before, right? So then,
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.580]   okay, maybe I can eliminate the gym. Okay, what about eating healthy? Is eating healthy
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.420]   going to make you want to go to the gym? Maybe, maybe not. Is it going to make me want to
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:15.220]   be nice to my family? I don't know. Is it going to make me want to be more purposeful
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.220]   in my life?
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:22.180]   So, you can keep going down the list and what I've found is that actually meditation is
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:28.180]   probably one of the best key habits because it gets rid of that one thing that makes you
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.300]   not want to go to the gym which is stress, that makes you not want to eat healthy which
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.980]   is stress, that makes you not want to be nice which is stress, that makes you not sleep
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:46.360]   well which is stress. So, stress can be tied to most of the bad habits that we have in
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:53.580]   our lives. When you can eliminate stress by exposing it to its kryptonite which is again,
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:48:00.340]   it's not that meditation is the superman. Meditation will help manufacture endogenous
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:07.860]   chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and anandamine and all the bliss chemicals, oxytocin
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:13.940]   that melt stress away inside of the body. And when you have a body that is freer of
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:19.940]   stress then you naturally feel more inclined to do the other things that you know you want
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.540]   to do in order to have the best life possible.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:28.500]   The other thing about it and this is potentially even more important is that meditation is
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:35.380]   kind of like - it's like you know Wonder Woman's lasso. When she lasso somebody, her superpower
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:40.780]   is that lasso forces them to tell the truth. Meditation is like a truth serum. It's really
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.680]   hard to bullshit yourself when you're meditating every day. It's hard to lie to yourself about
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.260]   what you are going to do, what you're not going to do, you know, and walk around pretending
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.900]   that things are the case when they're not the case and you find yourself having more
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.580]   moments of boldness, more honest conversations.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:04.140]   You're calling yourself out more about, you know, BSing yourself and then that's also
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:11.220]   - that also plays a role in you forming good habits because you're now able to say, "Okay,
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.580]   I know I'm not going to wake up at six in the morning to work on my memoir. So, maybe
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:20.620]   I need to institute some other sort of system that's going to put me in a better position
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:25.080]   to do that. And maybe that requires getting some accountability. Maybe I need to drop
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.740]   money on a coach because that's what I really pay attention to is when I spend money on
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:34.020]   something." And so, you do that and that's your path, right?
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.780]   And again, this is - it's different for everybody but I think the thing that's lacking for most
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.780]   of us is honesty. We're lying to ourselves about what we think we're going to do. Our
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.220]   intentions are great. We have the best of intentions. It's just that we don't have any
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.580]   history of evidence that we're going to actually do these things that we're telling ourselves
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.220]   we're going to do. And if we're honest with ourselves about that, then we can put ourselves
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.020]   in a better position and there's a million ways to do that.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.780]   I have two thoughts. One, is there a length of time you think someone needs to at a minimum
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:07.140]   kind of commit before they feel like they might be able to check in and see some benefit?
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.700]   Obviously, if you just meditate one time for 15 minutes, you're not going to see a ton
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.860]   of impact on your life.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.380]   It's less about time and more about understanding what you're doing. If you don't know what
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.100]   you're doing, even two minutes is going to feel like a torture, a nightmare. But if you
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.860]   know what you're doing, 20 minutes is not going to be long enough. You're going to want
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.700]   to go longer than 20.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:33.820]   So, provided that you know what you're doing, then you want to do about minimum 10 minutes,
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.660]   maximum 20 minutes.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:41.220]   But how many days do you think someone should commit to doing this? I mean, I know you probably
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:47.300]   would say all of the days, but is there, you know, go for three weeks and see what happens.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.140]   Go for a month, go for a week.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.520]   You need to do it 90 days in order for it to become a habit, in order for your body
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.420]   to get used to the chemicals being released during the meditation. And then it becomes
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:03.860]   - it's in the same category as coffee, cigarettes, you know, sugar. You don't have to plan it.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:08.380]   Your body will just naturally crave it and you'll rearrange your entire schedule to do
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.380]   it.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:14.180]   So, if you want to give yourself that level of freedom, and that's - it's a freedom.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.100]   You have to earn it, but it's a freedom.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.140]   That consistency leads to the freedom of, "Oh, my body is craving this experience now."
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.580]   So, yeah, 90 days, three months.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.340]   10, 20 minutes a day.
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:30.720]   I would say 20 minutes a day for three months in a row. And you will be - you will find
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.020]   yourself dependent on meditation.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:39.780]   And you said, you know, a coach, accountability. Are there other ways that are maybe not as
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.940]   expensive as a coach? Could you have a friend? Could you have a partner?
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.740]   You know those videos where it says, "If I lost everything, this is how I would rebuild
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:51.780]   my wealth." If I didn't know anything about - if I lost all of my experience in meditation,
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.700]   what I would do is I would get my - I would even get Travel Lite, which is my recent book.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.860]   I would get my book Bliss More, which is my How to Succeed in Meditation Without Really
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.860]   Trying book.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:07.140]   And I would read that book and I would listen to the audio of that book, which will be an
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.420]   investment of about 20 bucks.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.540]   And I would do everything that that book tells me to do, which is essentially to adopt that
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.660]   nonchalant attitude and to be consistent for 90 days.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.900]   And it helps, you know, there's all kinds of questions that everybody and their mother
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.340]   has had with meditation.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.900]   Should I be focusing my breath? Should I use crystals? Should I do it at this time? Should
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.300]   I do it right before bed? Should I do it right after I eat?
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.780]   All those questions are answered in that book and it'll give you the playbook for getting
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.500]   a practice started.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:38.140]   And then once you start to get enough positive experiences, maybe you want to take it to
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.820]   the next level where you actually go and study with somebody.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:45.780]   And what gets unlocked at these levels, you know, when you start to study with someone
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.380]   else? Do you get more out of it?
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:54.340]   Oh, 100%, yeah. It's like learning how to swim from a book. I mean, technically you
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:58.300]   can do it, you know, they'll tell you, okay, you need to torque your body here, you need
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.580]   to elongate, you need to move.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:05.740]   But there's nothing like having a teacher watch you swim and give you real-time feedback
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:11.540]   and give you drills and, you know, and answer your questions in real time.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:18.340]   So, having that verification and validation of technique and form and experiences can
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:25.460]   really accelerate your enjoyability factor when it comes to meditation. Otherwise, you're
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.780]   kind of reinventing the wheel every day.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.000]   I think we covered a lot of things. The one thing we didn't talk about, which is funny
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.860]   because I think travel is a very common theme of the show. I love to travel, we have whole
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:42.700]   episodes about places and you know, one of the things that as you were talking about
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.940]   happiness and happiness, it made me realize, you know, you only have a backpack.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.740]   You know, I said in the intro, but for people that don't know, I don't mean, you know, you
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:56.380]   have a backpack. I mean, like all of your worldly possessions are fit in a carry on
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:02.140]   a small backpack. I realized you probably... It's not that you thought getting rid of your
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:05.660]   possessions would make you happy. It seems like you realize you're already happy without
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.540]   them, why have more?
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:13.580]   But talk a little bit about the transition to so few things and what that's unlocked
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:14.580]   for you.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.180]   Yeah. People ask me, you know, "When did you start becoming a minimalist?" And what they're
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:23.540]   expecting me to say is that, "Oh, I became minimalist on May 31st, 2018 when I moved
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:28.460]   out of my two-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica and into my carry-on bag, which was the first
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:32.900]   apartment I had was my carry-on bag. And then a year later, I downsized into a backpack
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:39.700]   when I realized I had too much stuff." But the real answer is I became a minimalist in
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:45.860]   2003 when I started taking my meditation practice seriously. Because what that did was it helped
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:54.340]   me to create internal space. And it's the internal spaciousness, aka fulfillment, that
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:55:01.740]   genuine sense of fulfillment that allowed me to become more and more unattached to things
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.460]   going in the way that I thought that they should have gone in.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.180]   And if you think about it and this is, you know, the listeners can run this thought experiment.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.500]   I want you to think about the last time you suffered, the last time you experienced suffering.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:20.140]   And let's just keep it really light, emotional suffering, okay? Not like you got hit by a
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:26.820]   car but just emotional suffering. I guarantee you, it was for one of two reasons. Either
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:31.860]   something didn't happen in the way that you thought it should have happened or it didn't
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.300]   happen in a time you thought it should have happened in.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:41.940]   So, all suffering, not pain, but suffering, which is the soundtrack on top of pain, all
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:50.340]   suffering leads back to some expectation. And that expectation is tied to our past.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:54.100]   Because we've learned, we've been conditioned to believe that something needs to happen
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:59.940]   in this amount of time or it needs to happen in this way. And maybe we've experienced pain
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:05.940]   throughout the years that has helped to hardwire that expectation. And if it doesn't happen
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:12.140]   today or tomorrow in the way that I think it should happen, then I'm having a bad day.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:18.660]   And that's what makes a bad day, is a day that we can't adapt to change. It's really
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:24.340]   that simple. And a good day is a day where we may be experiencing lots of demands and
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.780]   lots of pressures but we're moving through it, we're navigating it successfully, we're
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:33.540]   adapting to it. And that feels good, there's a feeling tone that comes from that. When
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:38.540]   you have a day full of demands and you're just able - you're hitting every single one,
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:43.700]   you're moving through them, you're learning things, you're present, you're engaged.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:49.260]   And if you have a string of those kinds of days, then that leads to a successful life.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:54.440]   I'm talking about feeling tone now, not like, "Oh, I have more money than the next person".
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.420]   But you can have all the money in the world and still feel like a failure and still feel
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:03.580]   - and still suffer. Or you could be in a situation where you just have a modest amount of money
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:08.300]   but you've adapted to the changes in your relationship successfully, you've adapted
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:13.220]   to the changes in your family dynamics successfully, you've adapted to - you know, there was a
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:18.300]   storm in your area and something happened to your house, you adapted to that successfully.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:22.780]   And every time you are able to successfully adapt to something, you get gifted with some
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:28.540]   insight, some perspective that allows you to help others, to be more useful in the world.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:33.300]   So, maybe you wrote something, you started a blog, you started a podcast, you helped
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:38.260]   people in some way and that comes with its own sense of gratification and fulfillment.
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:43.460]   And so, you keep that happening from all sides and that's what a successful life is at the
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.620]   end of the day. So obviously, you know, practices like meditation are helpful for that because
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.860]   it allows you to just be more present.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:55.060]   But then it's not enough to just, you know, solve everything. You still have to be the
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.020]   best version of you out in the world, whatever that looks like. And you still have to be
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:03.580]   moving forward and progressing and growing and stretching into your potential. And that's
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:11.700]   where you really get the biggest wins in life is when you're doing that as a process, not
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.260]   as a destination, but as a process.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:20.020]   It's funny because I feel like almost anyone you talk to that practices minimalism in terms
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:24.500]   of material items, their answer seems to be, you should get rid of your things. And yours
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:29.180]   is like, I haven't heard you once tell me that I should live out of a backpack. It's
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.820]   more like that comes later after you figure out.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:39.100]   The backpack experience is my version of stretching into my potential. So, I'm not ever telling
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.020]   anybody else to do that, but you have your version of that and your version of that may
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:50.220]   be starting the business, starting the podcast. It may be starting the garden. It may be volunteering
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:54.060]   at a homeless shelter. It may be something that stretches you, something that's a little
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:58.420]   bit uncomfortable, right? And that's what the backpack thing was for me. The idea of
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:05.500]   doing it, it was something that excited me, but it also made me really uncomfortable because
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:10.620]   there was, you know, I was in my forties, I was in my mid forties when I made that decision.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.660]   I was childless and didn't have a relation. I'd just broken up with my girlfriend and
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:21.500]   I felt like I had all of the metrics that one would need. I have my shit together. I'm
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:28.580]   a good looking guy. I'm tall. I'm successful in my career. I have a purpose, a passion.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.900]   I've got this beautiful apartment, 10 minutes walking from the beach, under market value.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:37.300]   I've got money saved up. I've got a supportive family, strong connection to my parents. I've
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:45.020]   got all the things, but I can't seem to get a relationship that makes me want to take
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:53.140]   it to the next level yet. And I'm not getting any younger. So, it's like, you know, I could
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:57.060]   have easily talked myself out of that and thought, you know, this is silly. This is
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:02.940]   stupid. Women aren't going to be excited about some old ass dude who lives from a backpack.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.660]   You know, that's not going to make them want to get married and have kids. So, it was like
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:14.420]   flying in the face of the conventional wisdom, but that wasn't the instruction. The call
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:19.580]   from inside was now's the time to have this experience. And I'm still in process. I'm
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.860]   still not married. I mean, I have relationships and stuff, you know, and those are wonderful,
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:29.140]   but we'll have to see how everything turns out, you know, but I've learned a long, long,
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:34.100]   long, long time ago that when you ignore that inner calling, things don't get better. Oftentimes
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.260]   they get worse. And if we have more time, I could share some of those experiences with
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:44.900]   you, but when you do follow that inner calling relentlessly, things only ever get better.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.900]   You only ever win. And when I say win, I'm not talking about money, although that could
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:57.700]   be one of the symptoms. You can sleep at night knowing that you did your best and you lived
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:03.620]   your life in alignment and integrity with your heart. And that is the biggest win that
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   I can imagine.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:11.380]   - Are there any other topics or, I don't know, tactics or optimizations and throughout this
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.380]   that we missed?
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.340]   - I mean, there's tons. I feel like I included a lot in this book specifically with things
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.340]   like working out.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.220]   - All right, let's give us one there.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:26.580]   - Well, I have this, you know, again, working out is tough for even people who've been working
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:32.740]   out for their whole life, like myself. I put myself in that category. I didn't really look
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:37.500]   forward to going to the gym until I started taking the minimalist approach to working
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:47.660]   out. And what that means is doing less, but doing it with a level of quality that left
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:55.740]   you wanting more. And so, instead of going to the gym and doing a whole hour long regimen
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.900]   where you're super setting this and that and doing this and finishing with that, I just
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:10.300]   do one exercise. I do one - there's like five to 10 lifts and I'm focusing on resistance
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:15.300]   training now because it's just important for maintaining muscle mass. But there's like
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:21.260]   five to 10 lifts that you can do that basically hits the whole body over the course of doing
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:26.100]   those five to 10 lifts. And so, I've broken down my whole week in accordance to those
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:34.140]   lifts. They call them compound lifts, which means they help you contract multiple parts
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:39.460]   of the body. So, for instance, squatting. Squatting affects your legs, it affects your
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:45.580]   core and it affects your back. So, squatting is you standing underneath a bar on a squat
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:52.140]   rack and you just bending your knees and squatting down as much as is comfortable and coming
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:03:00.260]   back - pressing back up. And so, Thursdays are my squat day. So, I do one exercise, five
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:05.180]   sets of five squats and I go for progressive overload, which means doing a little bit more
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:10.540]   each time and that's it. That's all I do. So, the whole workout takes me like 20 minutes
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   and then I leave the gym. Even if I want to do more, I leave the gym. Then I come back
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:21.220]   on Friday and I do pull-ups and I'll do five sets of five weighted pull-ups. And then I'll
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:27.820]   come back on Saturday and I'll do arms. And like that, Mondays are bench presses and Tuesdays
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:32.140]   are dead lifts. And so, I have something for each day.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:38.380]   And then what I do is I do affirmations instead of counting down reps. Instead of going five,
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:44.780]   four, three, two, one or one, two, three, four, five, I'll do an affirmation. An affirmation
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:53.100]   is a positive saying that helps to integrate something that you want to experience in your
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:04:01.620]   life. So, for instance, you could say "I am perfect whole complete". "I am perfect whole
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:06.100]   complete", that's an affirmation. "I am perfect whole complete". I need for nothing, right?
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:11.980]   In other words, you could also - on the next set, you can do your wife. Jill is perfect
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:17.460]   whole complete. And then your kids, Dan is perfect whole complete. Jane is perfect whole
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.060]   complete, like that.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.740]   And so, it just gives you a different energy when you're lifting because it's like you
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:28.580]   got to finish the sentence, otherwise they're not going to be perfect whole complete. And
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:34.060]   at the same time, it's almost like the lifting becomes like a meditation or like a prayer
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.820]   for you. And it's a different energy, you know, it's a different way to bring excitement
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:45.680]   into the experience. And you did something useful for other people. So, it just checks
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:53.620]   a lot of boxes, which is what I mean by spiritual minimalism is, you know, doing more with less.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:59.220]   You could have counted numbers, you know, there's no harm in doing that. But now you've
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.740]   got to still do your prayers, you still got to do your affirmations, you still got to
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.540]   do your meditation, all that. But you can combine all that too and make it into this
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.860]   really beautiful special ritual that you get to enjoy.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:17.420]   So, I have a lot of tips for that inside of the book, how to bring more of that meditative
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:21.780]   component into everything you're doing, even like walking things into, you know, bringing
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:25.620]   - instead of just sitting there counting your steps, you'd make it into like more of a meditation
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   as well.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.300]   Yeah, there were a lot of those in the book that I enjoyed reading. There's some stuff
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.740]   on communication that I thought was really interesting. And so, I'm not going to ask
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.180]   you all of them because anyone here can just go and check out the book as I did.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:42.780]   And yeah, so before we wrap, two things. One, I always like to ask people, especially people
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:48.020]   who live abroad, is there - if someone's coming to where you are in the world, there's a little
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.300]   bit of a detour from everything we've said, but how would you recommend them spend a day
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:58.140]   or two, maybe with at least one or two specific things that you love in the city?
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:04.260]   I'm in Mexico City and first of all, if you live in the States, it's a very easy place
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:11.260]   to get to. Most cities have direct flights to Mexico City. And if you only have a day
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:21.700]   to spend in Mexico City, I would say to get yourself maybe an Airbnb in an area called
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:28.420]   La Condesa. And in La Condesa, it's one of the most - they refer to it as like the bubble
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:34.500]   of Mexico City, right? It's where a lot of the expats live and it's one of the most walkable
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:40.540]   areas. And there's like a thousand cafes, there's a bunch of little shops and there
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:49.980]   are central parks. There's one park called Parque Mexico. So, I would just say just land
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.700]   in La Condesa somewhere, anywhere and just walk around and you can just kind of roam
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:07:01.540]   around and you can use Parque Mexico as your sort of central point of focus. So, if you're
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.540]   moving, if you get lost, just walk - look at your map on your phone and walk towards
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.140]   Parque Mexico. And the closer you get to that park, the more cafes, the more restaurants,
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.940]   the more shops you're going to see. And it's a great place to just get lost and not have
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.580]   an agenda at all.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.620]   And everyone's out walking and there's these beautiful little paths that are tree-lined
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:26.260]   and tons of dogs if you're a dog lover and outdoor seating for - in these cafes. So,
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:32.100]   it's just a wonderful place just to kind of get lost and roam around. And if you are a
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:38.540]   student of language, you can practice what little Spanish you may know with the vendors
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:44.940]   and whoever's around. And yeah, I would say that's - you're going to stumble upon some
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:50.980]   wonderful food and some really charming little shops and lots of street vendors and things
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:51.980]   like that.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.420]   Just don't - whatever you do, don't drink the tap water. Don't try to - don't brush
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:00.460]   your teeth with it. Just use bottled water for that. You can drink tap water at the restaurants
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.460]   because they filter it.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:06.940]   - I will say, I think there's one actually right near the park. I think that El Morro
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:12.380]   is a churrascaria - or churrea. I can't remember the way to pronounce it. But they have amazing
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:18.100]   churros. And I'll push you to give one recommendation if there's a place you like to eat, if someone's
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.100]   looking for a snack.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.060]   - All right. So, it's a small little cafe but they have a little something for everybody.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:31.580]   It's called Canopia. Canopia. C-A-N-O-P-I-A. My friend Rocio runs it. It's right in the
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:38.160]   heart of Condesa and it's a beautiful little place. Really eclectic crowd. They're open
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:44.420]   all day long and yeah, it's like a nice little wine bar vibe at night. It's a nice little
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:49.140]   sort of lunch-breakfast type of spot during the day. So, I would say check out Canopia.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:53.940]   - Love it. Thank you. Okay. Where can we send people who want - I mean, we talked about
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:59.160]   the book Travel Light. It's out now. By the time this comes out, check that out. Bliss
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.460]   More for meditation, everything. Where else can we send people?
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:08.720]   - You can find me on the socials @lightwatkins and you can also find me at lightwatkins.com.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.880]   - And the podcast. I mean, if you're here, if you're listening to a podcast, you have
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   your own.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   - Podcast is The Light Watkins Show.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   - Yeah.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.800]   - So, I would say the website lightwatkins.com is the portal for everything that I'm doing.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.080]   The books, the podcast, the online community that I have and everything else that I'm doing,
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.040]   the retreats that I'm doing, et cetera.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.400]   - Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being here. This is awesome.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   - A hundred percent. I really enjoyed the conversation. Thank you for having me.
