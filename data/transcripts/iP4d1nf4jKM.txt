[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I'd like to just briefly touch upon this idea
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   that certain occupations are associated
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.520]   with a higher incidence of bipolar depression.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.840]   And in fact, it's been explored at a research level.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.240]   Really, there are data pointed to the fact
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.480]   that certain individuals of certain occupations
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.200]   tend to be more creative
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.320]   and that creativity is associated with,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.400]   again, associate, this isn't causal,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.480]   it's associate or correlated with,
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.760]   higher levels or incidence of bipolar depression
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760]   and maybe even other forms of depression.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.880]   So this is a study looking at mood disorders
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.480]   in eminent individuals.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.600]   So these are people that are not just good at what they do,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600]   but are exceptional at what they do,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.320]   and explored the percentage of people in given professions
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.680]   with either depression or mania.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.080]   And this was actually a dataset gleaned
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.760]   from more than 1,000 20th century Westerners
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920]   based on their biographies that were reviewed
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760]   by other people.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.240]   So it's a bit of an indirect measurement.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.240]   This isn't psychiatrist data.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.400]   This is data, or I should say, these are data
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.000]   that were compiled from self-reports
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.840]   or from reads of self-reports.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.520]   And they explored a number of different professions.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.160]   So for instance, they looked at people in the military
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.120]   or people who were professional athletes
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.760]   or natural scientists or social scientists,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.040]   people who occupied positions in public office
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   or were musical performers, artists,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.280]   nonfiction writers, poetry, et cetera.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.920]   There are a lot of professions here.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.360]   I will post this, or I'll post a link to it
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.680]   in the show note captions for you to peruse,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.800]   but I'll just give you a sense of the extremes
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120]   on this graph because they're very interesting.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.200]   Turns out that if you were to look at the profession,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.640]   or I should say among the professions they looked at
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.900]   in this study, 'cause they didn't look at all professions,
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.220]   those in the military and those who are professional
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.260]   athletes or had jobs in the social or natural sciences
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.940]   had the, of those, there was a lower percentage
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.620]   of those that had depression or mania.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.580]   In some cases, like those who are professional athletes
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.060]   didn't seem to have, there was no incidence of mania,
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.820]   at least in this data set.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.260]   Whereas at the opposite extreme of the graph,
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.860]   those that were poets, so these are eminent individuals,
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.740]   people that were exceptional poets,
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.020]   exceptional fiction writers, exceptional artists,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.980]   or non-fiction writers.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.760]   Well, there, especially for the poets,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   you find that as many as 90% of these very successful poets
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.360]   had either depression or mania.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.900]   As high as 90%, that's incredible.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   Contrast that with military where it's as few as 10%
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140]   or professional athletes where it's as few as 20%.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.260]   And for the professional athletes, as I mentioned before,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.900]   none of them had mania.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.740]   So does this mean that being a poet
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.280]   will make you manic or depressed?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.000]   Well, first of all, let's look at the poetry category.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.580]   It turns out that 75% of these eminent poets,
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.460]   these highly accomplished poets had major depression.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.320]   Whereas only about 20% of those poets had manic episodes.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.340]   Okay, so again, it's not that being a poet
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.260]   is going to give you mania.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.300]   Certainly, we're not saying that.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.140]   It's not that being a poet is going to give you depression,
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.300]   but it turns out that people with depression
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.900]   and people with depression and mania
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.820]   seem to gravitate towards poetry,
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.120]   or at least are very successful at poetry.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.940]   Again, associative, correlative, no causal relationship here.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.020]   But it is really striking to see
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.840]   how the creative occupations, poetry, fiction, art,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.020]   non-fiction writing, even though non-fiction writing
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.820]   is about non-fiction, it's still creative.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.620]   Music, composition, theater,
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.340]   much higher incidence of things like mania.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.700]   And in fact, for the people in theater, the actors,
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.540]   even though the overall occurrence of depression and mania
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.900]   is lower than that in poets,
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.660]   the fraction of those individuals that have mania
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.200]   is exceedingly high.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.980]   It's about 30% of those that they looked at
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.500]   who are actors have manic episodes
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.940]   or have full-blown mania.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.220]   So I'm referring to these data because,
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.420]   first of all, I find them incredibly interesting, right?
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.340]   Up until now, we've been talking about bipolar disorder
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.380]   and other mood disorders for their maladaptive effects.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.040]   And again, they're extremely maladaptive,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.140]   much, much higher incidence of suicide, et cetera.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.700]   But we'd be wrong to say that certain aspects
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   of manic episodes don't lend themselves well to creativity
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.580]   or that certain aspects of major depression
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.640]   don't lend themselves well to creativity
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.000]   or to the performing arts or to poetry.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.600]   That said, in no way, shape or form,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.960]   do I believe that being depressed is a good thing
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.560]   or that being manic is a good thing.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   Again, we return to the basic foundational criteria
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160]   for bipolar disorder and major depression,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.640]   which is that the pressured speech, the not sleeping,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.420]   the incredible increases in energy and the flights of ideas
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.880]   are generally not going to lead,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.720]   or I think it's fair to say,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.820]   are not going to lead to good places.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.520]   In fact, often lead to bad places.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.820]   But we would also be wrong if we didn't consider the fact
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.400]   that there is a somewhat inextricable relationship
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.760]   between mania and creativity.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   And it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.160]   maybe even an hour a day or 30 minutes a day
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.200]   of composing or writing poetry,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.640]   maybe even some of the lows that we feel, right?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.200]   Some of the sadness, some of the grief,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.880]   some of the nostalgia that we feel,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.960]   provided that it's not pathologic,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.920]   that it's not persistent for the four or seven days
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.080]   that are diagnostic of bipolar two
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.160]   and bipolar one disorder respectively.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.760]   Well, then we can start to view emotional states
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.040]   as something that can actually lend themselves
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.160]   to positive outcomes and maybe even to creativity
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.900]   and to improved occupations.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.200]   So it's important that we have a nuanced view
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.260]   of what sadness versus depression
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.040]   versus major depression are.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.680]   It's important that we distinguish between being erratic,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.440]   being very energized and full-blown bipolar disorder.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   And I raise this for another reason as well.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.340]   Nowadays, it's very common to hear people saying,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.280]   "Oh, you know, that person is OCD."
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.620]   Well, on the episode about OCD that I did a few weeks back,
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.800]   that you can find if you like at hubermanlab.com,
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.400]   in that episode, I pointed out that OCD,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.460]   obsessive compulsive disorder, is very maladaptive, right?
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.560]   I think it's number seven, as I recall,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.000]   on the list of debilitating diseases, all diseases,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.840]   in terms of lost time at work,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.520]   suffering relationships, et cetera.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.240]   So it's a really serious condition.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.720]   And yet we often hear, "Oh, that person is obsessive."
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.020]   And as I pointed out,
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.440]   there is obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.200]   And then there is obsessive compulsive tendencies,
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.940]   which actually benefit people.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.400]   But that is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.120]   as a clinically diagnosed thing.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.720]   Similarly, we hear that, "Oh, somebody is being bipolar."
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.800]   "You know, they're all over the place, they're bipolar."
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.600]   Well, that's a very subjective and kind of label
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.520]   that people give one another in passing.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.920]   More and more often, I'm hearing this.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.680]   And yet bipolar disorder, whether or not it's BP1 or BP2,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.760]   are extremely maladaptive
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.060]   and extremely associated with high suicide risk.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.360]   So while I'm not here to police people,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.960]   certainly not the word police or the nomenclature police,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.840]   I do think that whether or not you refer to people as OCD
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.920]   or as bipolar, et cetera, that's up to you, all right?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.160]   It's not my place to say.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.720]   But I do think it's important that all of us understand
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.580]   that these psychiatric conditions
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.380]   carry with them tremendous maladaptive weight.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.960]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.380]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.180]   (upbeat music)
