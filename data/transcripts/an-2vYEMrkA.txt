[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   This evening, to be found in Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the first chapter, verses
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:23.920]   3, 4, and 5. Verses 3, 4, and 5 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:37.160]   Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.760]   for our sins, that he might deliver us from this evil world according to the will of God
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.880]   and our Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:04.920]   I want particularly to deal with the words, "who gave himself for our sins, that he might
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:19.080]   deliver us from this present evil world." Now we meet together on remembrance Sunday
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.520]   evening. And of necessity, the first question presenting itself to me as I was thinking
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.200]   of and preparing for this Sunday was, "How can this Sunday evening be spent in the most
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.880]   profitable manner?" And immediately it seemed to me that there were certain things at interest
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.880]   which we should not do if we were anxious that our time should be spent truly in a profitable
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   manner. It seemed obvious and clear to me that we must not spend our time on this occasion
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:11.920]   merely in a kind of riot of sentiment and of emotion. I speak carefully, I want to speak
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.520]   advisedly. It is no part of the preaching of the gospel to trample upon people's feelings,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.480]   but neither is it a part of the preaching of the gospel simply to play upon people's
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:38.520]   feelings. That can be done and done very easily. But the question is, is it profitable? It
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.640]   is good and right that we should ever keep alive in our hearts the memory of those who
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.600]   have gone from us, from this life and from this world, into eternity. But we must always
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:04.480]   do that in a true way and in a Christian way. And that never means merely being sentimental
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   or emotional. So it seems to me that that is not profitable.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.280]   And another thing I felt which would not be profitable is this, that we should spend our
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.600]   evening in doing what is done so frequently, namely using this occasion to talk about the
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:38.120]   worth and the value of patriotism and to make appeals for loyalty to one's nation and the
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.200]   duty of serving one's nation in a true way. So often this Sunday is used like that, as
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.960]   a day when appeals are made to people to remember what they did during wartime and to apply
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.680]   the same spirit to peacetime. General statements of moral grounds and in moral terms and in
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.840]   terms of industry and of the whole welfare and well-being of the nation are thus frequently
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.360]   made on this particular day. But again I say we are not going to do that.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.080]   And we are not going to do that because that is not specifically Christian. It is the business
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.160]   of Christian people to be good citizens, but that is one of the very smallest parts of
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.520]   their business. There are things which come well before that and long before that. The
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.280]   world can do that. The world at its best in its own morality believes in patriotism and
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   in these various other duties which are inculcated. But that is not Christianity, I say. Christianity
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:58.840]   is not merely morality touched or tinged with emotion as Matthew Arnold thought it was.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.800]   It is spirituality. It is something altogether higher and in a different world and in a different
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.560]   realm. So we are not going to do that.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.840]   And the third thing which seemed to me to be so wrong, because it would be a final waste
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.640]   of time, is that we should spend our evening simply in talking about what an abomination
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.880]   war is, and that therefore we should spend our time in discussing together what can be
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.160]   done to abolish war, and how can we stop the manufacture of various kinds and types of
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.960]   armaments. I have no doubt a great deal of that will be done tonight as it was done this
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.440]   morning and as it will continue to be done. That this is a day, therefore, which we should
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:53.360]   spend in denouncing war in every shape and form and arriving at resolutions, perhaps,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.240]   which we would send up to the government and to the Prime Minister and thus do something
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   which is semi-political.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:11.720]   Well, again, I say we all must be agreed that war is sheer madness. It is unutterable folly.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.160]   But you know the business of Christianity and the preaching of the gospel is not just
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.320]   to say that. That is perfectly true. "Well, what is the business of the gospel?" says
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   someone. Well, I'll tell you. The business of the gospel primarily is this, is to enable
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.680]   us all to face something that is inevitably and certainly going to happen to us, whether
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.720]   there be another war or whether there be not another war. Here, you see, is the special
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.640]   business of Christianity. There may not be a third world war. These bombs about which
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.160]   we are hearing so much, they may never be used. It may produce a kind of stalemate.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.280]   Every nation may have so many that no nation will dare to use them. Very well. Now, that's
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:09.400]   a possibility. But I say that isn't my business. My business is this. Whether there is a war
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:18.160]   or not, whether these bombs are used or not, every one of us has got to die. Every one
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:27.720]   of us. And to go on into eternity. Now, that is an absolute certainty. If the bombs are
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.280]   used, we've got to go to eternity. We may go at any moment. If a war comes, we've got
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.120]   to go on to eternity. Yes, but I say, if a war doesn't come, if the bombs are not used,
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.520]   that still remains. Therefore, I would regard it as a waste of my time and yours if I spent
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.720]   a night in just denouncing war, denouncing the bombs, and doing nothing further. That's
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:08:02.880]   not Christianity. Christianity is that which enables us all to face God, to face our own
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:10.800]   death. This thing which is certainly coming to meet us, whatever men may do or whatever
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.480]   men may not do. Now, that, I say, is the business of the gospel. Or to put it in other terms,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:22.360]   I can put it like this. Those who attend here regularly have been following our discussion
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.840]   together of this great statement that we're looking at together once more. And they will
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:33.800]   remember that up to date we have seen something like this. This world in which you and I live
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:42.680]   is called this present evil world. I'm not going over that again. I think I've demonstrated
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.280]   that and proved it. A man who doesn't recognize that this world in which we live is an evil
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:59.080]   world and a passing world is indeed totally blind. The world is full of evil and of sin.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   This night of all nights ought to prove that to us. What causes this madness of war? What
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:11.200]   causes all the troubles and the trials and the tribulations? Well, there's only one answer.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:19.000]   It is the evil that is in the heart of men. It is the evil that is in this present world.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.240]   Very well, here's the business of the gospel. To deliver us from this present evil world.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.160]   My dear friend, if you're interested in a view of the world, let me put it simply to
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.480]   you. This is what the Bible says about it. It says that this world which is evil is under
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:45.040]   the wrath and under the condemnation of God. It's a doomed world. It's a world that is
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.000]   going to be destroyed. That is what the Bible says about the world. Now, you and I may not
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.600]   like that. That's not the question. It's not a question of what we like. If we believe
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.560]   this is the word of God, it's our business to study it. I believe it is the word of God,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.480]   and that's why I stand in this pulpit. And what this tells me to say is this, that this
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:12.200]   present evil world is under the condemnation and the wrath of God, and it's going to be
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:22.080]   destroyed. This book makes it perfectly plain and clear that the world cannot be improved.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:29.640]   The world cannot be redeemed. It's doomed. God has pronounced judgment upon it, and it
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.020]   is merely a matter of time before that judgment will descend upon this world. That's the message
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.020]   of the Bible.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:46.760]   Very well, here's the question for us. How can we be delivered from that? How can we
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.960]   be delivered from this present evil world, its influence, its mind, its outlook, its
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:59.320]   mentality, and above all, the doom and the disaster and the final destruction that is
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:09.140]   coming upon it? And the answer is this, that we cannot deliver ourselves, for we are evil.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.380]   What is the world? Well, the world is just you and me and all people who are like us,
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.320]   and we cannot deliver ourselves. You know, the whole story of humanity is just this.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.080]   Go back over the centuries. What's it all mean? It's this. The human race has been trying
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.640]   to deliver itself and its world, and it cannot do it. Here we are in the twentieth century.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.800]   Isn't it clear by now? Things are no better. They're getting worse. The world cannot deliver
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:43.960]   itself. Neither can any individual deliver himself out of this present evil world.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.680]   Well, you say, "Then are we irretrievably doomed? Are we of necessity lost?" My dear
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.720]   friend, that's exactly where the gospel of Jesus Christ comes in. That's the business
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.040]   of the gospel. Not to talk about these bombs and wars, that sort of thing's going on, and
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.120]   I predict to you tonight, and I'm doing nothing at all dangerous. Nobody's going to stop that.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:13.000]   Man in sin will go on until he destroys himself, and God will then visit him in judgment. It's
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.240]   a waste of time to be preaching about that. That's not preaching. The gospel is to be
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:26.160]   preached. And the good news of the gospel is this, that there is a way for us as individuals
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.240]   to be delivered out of that world. You can't deliver the world, but we as individuals can
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.760]   be delivered out of it. "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.200]   this present evil world."
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.680]   Now then, how is this to be done? Well, I began to say, to give the answer last Sunday
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:57.720]   evening, "Though men can do nothing about it, God can, and God has." Yes, it's according
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.560]   to the will of God and our Father that there is a way of salvation, and what we've seen
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.640]   about it is this, that God has a great plan for the redemption of men and women out of
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:14.280]   this present evil world. He planned it before the foundation of the world. And what are
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:21.680]   its characteristics? Here they are. It is all of God. It is all of grace. It is all
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.720]   in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:34.960]   Now then, the question before us this evening is this, "How does the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:45.760]   deliver us?" Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.960]   He is the one that delivers us from this present evil world. Now here is the question, "How
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:14:03.280]   does he do so?" And let me again give you the plain answer. He doesn't do it merely
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:12.480]   by his teaching. He doesn't do it merely by preaching the Sermon on the Mount. And
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:21.040]   I'll tell you why. Men, as he is in sin, cannot live the Sermon on the Mount. It's
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.120]   no use going to a man in sin and in the grip of evil and saying, "Turn the other cheek."
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.160]   He doesn't do it. He won't do it. He doesn't even believe in doing it. There is nothing
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:40.120]   which is so futile as just preaching the Christian ethic to people who are not Christian.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:47.040]   They cannot practice it. It is a sheer impossibility for them. That isn't the gospel. It isn't
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.360]   merely his teaching. Neither is it his example. The example of Christ has been before the
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:00.400]   world all these centuries. Mankind doesn't rise up to it and follow him. It was never
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:06.120]   meant to. He wasn't meant to save us by his example. How can a man who cannot come
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.160]   up to his own standard possibly follow him? How can a man who dares not go into the presence
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:19.540]   of saints possibly follow the Son of God who towers above them all? It's a sheer impossibility.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:27.040]   He doesn't do it by his life. He doesn't do it by his example. I must go further. He
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:36.120]   doesn't do it merely by his incarnation. Now that's a daring statement to make. A
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.240]   part of this gospel is to preach the incarnation. It is to say that when the fullness of the
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:49.360]   times was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.720]   that are under the law. We were looking at it last Sunday night. I say that one of the
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.480]   most stupendous, staggering events that has ever taken place in the world was that moment
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:07.560]   when Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary. That's a miracle. That's God come in the flesh.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.440]   That's the Word made flesh and beginning to dwell among us. The incarnation, the entry
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.320]   of the Son of God into time, into the world, into human history, under the law, born of
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:33.600]   a woman, staggering. Yet you know that in and of itself would never have saved anybody.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.840]   If that was the only thing he did, it would have been our final condemnation. For there
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.280]   we would have been looking at a human life that was perfect, and it would have left us
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:50.320]   hopelessly condemned and in our sins. No, he doesn't save us even by coming into the
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:17:00.800]   world and doing all he did when he was in it. How then does he save? How then does he
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:09.680]   deliver men from this present evil world? And here's the answer. His death. Who gave
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:19.560]   himself? Gave himself to what? Gave himself to the death of the cross. He gave himself
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.440]   for our sins. That's the answer.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:31.840]   And I just want to hold that before you this evening. This is a day when we think of death.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.480]   This is a day when we think of men who have laid down their lives for their country. This
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:45.520]   is a day when we think of sacrifice, self-sacrifice. Very well, I say, let us look at the example
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:59.040]   of self-sacrifice, of dying for others. What could be more appropriate, I say, on a night
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:06.160]   like this than to look at his death?
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:13.000]   Now then, let's look at it like this. This, I say, is the heart of the gospel. This is
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.480]   the essence of the Christian message. Whatever you may know or not know about Christianity,
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.880]   oh, my friend, get hold of this. May the Spirit of God enable me to speak and you to hear,
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.280]   so that whatever else I say you know or don't know, you may see the relevance and the meaning
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:41.000]   of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.880]   Here is the heart of the gospel. Paul puts it here, you see, "At once for us, blessed,"
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:53.840]   he says, "grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,"
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.920]   what's the important thing about him, "who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.680]   us from this present evil world." That's how he does the delivering.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:11.240]   Now have you noticed the emphasis that the New Testament puts upon that? This, I say,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:17.120]   is the very nerve and center of the Christian message. The apostle gives it us here at once
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.200]   at the very beginning of this epistle, but then he repeats it in the first verse of the
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.640]   third chapter. He says, "Oh foolish Galatians, who have bewitched you that ye should not
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:37.640]   obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.840]   you." Now what he means there is this. This "evidently set forth" should be translated
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.200]   by the word "placarded amongst you." "What did I do when I was preaching to you?" says
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.280]   Paul. "Well, in a sense I just came and held up a big placard before you." And what was
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:02.080]   on the placard? Oh, it was a cross and a dead body upon it. Jesus Christ, crucified, evidently
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:09.880]   set forth, placarded amongst you. That was what he had preached to them.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:17.640]   And then you remember at the end of this epistle, he says it again. "God forbid," he says,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:27.600]   "that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.880]   crucified unto me, and I unto the world." He does not want to hear anything else. He
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:42.240]   says, "Leave me alone. Henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:50.160]   marks of the Lord Jesus." This was the one thing that mattered with this apostle. But
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.080]   this is not only true of him, it is true of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.200]   Have you ever, I wonder, worked out the relative place and proportion of time and space that
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   is given in the Gospels to the death of the Lord Jesus Christ? Well, I will tell you the
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:16.560]   result of the calculation. It is a simple fact to say that one third of the Gospels
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:25.240]   is devoted to the death of Jesus Christ. One third is given to the death. With all the
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:30.400]   wonderful life and teaching and all the miracles and extraordinary deeds that he worked, a
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.360]   third of the space is given to his dying. You can almost hear the sound of the hammer
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:42.720]   hammering in the nails. Why all this detail? Why all this attention? And particularly in
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.400]   the view of this, that the writers knew perfectly well that there was nothing that was more
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:54.920]   offensive to the Jews than his death, that the death of Christ, we are told, was a stumbling
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:00.720]   block to the Jews. It was foolishness to the Greeks. And yet, though these men knew that,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:09.080]   they give a third of their space to his death. Why? Well, to show its significance. And if
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.320]   you read the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you will find that the first preachers preached
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:20.680]   about his death. We are told that Peter preached on it on the day of Pentecost. You read in
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:26.720]   Acts 17, verses 1 to 3, that Paul went into the synagogue of Thessalonica, and what did
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.320]   he preach to them? He preached this, that the Christ must needs have suffered, and that
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:40.520]   this Jesus, whom we preach unto you, is the Christ. He reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   proving and alleging that the Christ, the Messiah, the Deliverer, must needs have suffered,
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:56.680]   must need be put to death, and that this Jesus, whom we preach unto you, is the Christ.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:03.120]   What did this Apostle Paul preach? Well, he tells the Corinthians, he reminds them, "I
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:10.920]   determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified. I came
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.000]   unto you," he said, "in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. That was my preaching,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.040]   Jesus Christ and Him crucified." He determined not to know anything else among them. He did
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.200]   not talk to them about Greek philosophy. He did not talk about politics. He did not talk
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:33.800]   about war, Jesus Christ and Him crucified, nothing else. He reminds them again of the
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:40.400]   same thing in that fifteenth great chapter of that first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.520]   He says, "I remind you of that which I preached to you unto the beginning, for I delivered
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:53.480]   unto you first of all that which I had also received, how that Christ died for our sins
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:24:00.080]   according to the scriptures. That was the first thing, the most prominent thing always.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.680]   And it is not only true of this man, I say." The Apostle Peter says the same thing. This
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:14.160]   is his message. "Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.180]   dead to sins, should live unto righteousness." Does not the Apostle John say exactly the
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.480]   same thing? Read his first epistle and you will find the answer. Go to that fourth chapter
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:34.200]   and listen to this. "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:41.040]   sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:48.520]   love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son," what for? "to be
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:57.400]   a propitiation for our sins, to die on the cross, to be a propitiation, to be a sacrifice,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:05.520]   an offering, an expiation, an offering presented to appease a holy and a righteous God." That
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.320]   is what John says about it.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.360]   What does the last book of the Bible say about it? Well, this is what I read in Revelation
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:26.480]   1, verse 5, "unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood." You see,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.240]   this is the message of the Christian faith. Well then, says someone, what does all this
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:42.400]   mean? What is the death of Christ to us? You are asking us to look at him dying there upon
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.240]   the cross. What does it mean? What is its message? Well, I'll tell you what it means.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.160]   First and foremost, I'll tell you what it doesn't mean. You know, that death of his
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:26:01.720]   on the cross wasn't an accident. It wasn't something that surprised him. People seem
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.800]   to think that it took him as a great surprise. It didn't. He knew it was coming. He said
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:14.360]   so. He said he must go, that this hour was the hour for which he'd come into the world.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.640]   What is that death? Is it the death of a martyr? No, it isn't the death of a martyr. Is it
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.320]   the death of the greatest hero the world has ever seen? No, it isn't. Is it the death of
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.920]   a pacifist? Is it just the death of a man who says, "Well, I'll not resist you. Do
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.880]   as you like to me," and that others may follow his example? No, no, it's nothing of the
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:49.560]   sort. What is it then? Well, our text tonight tells us, "Who gave himself." It was voluntary.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:56.160]   He wasn't taken unawares and by surprise. He came to do it. He gave himself for us.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.120]   He'd already told the disciples he was going to. He says, "Listen, the Son of Man is not
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:11.400]   come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:17.240]   He said that. You'll find it in Matthew 20, 28. You'll find it in Mark 10, 45. Then he
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.040]   said again, you'll find this in the tenth chapter of John's Gospel. He says, "I am
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:29.000]   the Good Shepherd, and the Good Shepherd giveth, layeth down his life for the sheep." He says,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.240]   "No man taketh my life from me. I lay it down of myself. I lay it down and I take it
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.800]   up again. No man taketh it from me." Don't go away with the impression that it was those
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.440]   cruel people who took his life from him. They were merely the instruments. He had come into
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:51.320]   this world, my dear friends, in order to do that, who gave himself.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:28:01.560]   Here's another phrase to remind you of it. We are told that he set his face steadfastly
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:09.720]   to go to Jerusalem. Thomas and the other disciples remonstrated with him. They said, "Don't
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.400]   go up to Jerusalem. You know very well that that fox Herod, that king Herod, is waiting
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.880]   to kill you." And our Lord nevertheless said, "We must go." He says, "It must be the
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.120]   case that no prophet shall perish outside Jerusalem." He set his face steadfastly to
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.000]   go to Jerusalem.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.400]   In the garden of Gethsemane, Peter pulled out his sword. He said, "I'm going to defend
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.360]   you. Put it back," he said. "Don't you think that I could command twelve legions of angels
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.400]   and be carried in safety and without a single scar or wound to heaven if I chose to do so?
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.760]   I've got the power to do so. But if I did that, how should I fulfill all righteousness?"
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:29:03.440]   No, no, he wasn't taken by surprise or unawares. He came in order to die. As Peter puts it
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.320]   in his sermon on the day of Pentecost, he died according to the predeterminate counsel
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.840]   and for knowledge of God.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.200]   "Yes," says the Apostle Paul in writing to the Philippians, "though he was equal with
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:23.080]   God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation."
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:29.520]   He made himself. And he came in the form of men and as a servant, and he humbled himself.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.240]   Even unto the death of the cross, he gave himself. It's voluntary.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.080]   Go and ask the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, "Why the eternal Son of God, who
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.400]   is the express image of his person and the brightness of his glory, why he was made a
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.880]   little lower than the angels for a while?" And he'll give you this answer. He says, "For
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:30:00.480]   the suffering of death, that he might taste death for every man."
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:07.080]   Here then is the first thing we've got to realize, that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:15.920]   of God, came into this world with one primary object, and that was to die upon that cross.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.720]   "For this hour," he says, "I have come." He says, "What shall I pray? 'Father, deliver
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:34.040]   me out of this hour?' No," he says, "For this hour I came into the world. Father, glorify
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.640]   thyself through this hour."
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.640]   Very well, I say, that's the first thing he teaches us, that it was a voluntary death.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:50.720]   He wasn't a conscript. It didn't happen by accident. He might not have escaped it. No,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.280]   no, he came deliberately, specifically to die. Men joining armies don't go into the
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.880]   army to die. They hope they won't die. They hope they'll come back. Here is one who comes
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:07.920]   voluntarily in order, deliberately, to die.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:22.400]   Why does he die? He gave himself for our sins, in connection with our sins, on account of
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.680]   our sins, on behalf of our sins. What's he mean? Oh, let me put it to you as plainly
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.840]   as I can. Why did he come into the world? Why did he give himself and go to that death
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:42.880]   on the cross? Here's the answer. Your sins and mine have come between us and God. That's
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.920]   why our lives are not blessed. That's why we are miserable, wretched failures. That's
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:55.200]   why the world is full of blood and chaos and warfare and misery and immorality and vice
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.560]   and foulness. Why? Our sins have come between us and God and are separating us from his
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.240]   glory and from his blessing.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:20.000]   So he came into this world because of our sins. And there was only one way to deliver
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.360]   us from our sins and thus restore us to God and his blessing. And that was that somehow
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:34.920]   or another these sins might be taken away and that thus we might be delivered from this
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:42.400]   present evil world. What ties us to it is the sin that's in us. And God hates that
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.960]   sin. And the world, I say, is under doom and will be destroyed. How can we be saved from
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:55.920]   it? Well, this sin must somehow be removed. He gave himself for our sins.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:02.600]   But what exactly do you mean by that, says someone? Well, let me take you a step further.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:09.480]   The Old Testament helps us to understand it. Go back to your Old Testament and you will
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:15.640]   find that God gave instructions to Moses to teach the people that they were to bring certain
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:22.720]   sacrifices to God. The tabernacle, the temple were to be built. Every morning, every evening
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.360]   a lamb was to be slain and offered upon an altar. Various other animals were to be killed,
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:35.080]   bulls and goats. The blood was to be presented. The animals were to be burned. What's it
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.160]   all about? What's it all mean? God taught Moses to teach the people that. What's
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   he teaching them?
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.560]   Oh, we are told in the Scriptures, Old Testament and new, that the meaning of all the sacrifices
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:57.280]   was this, that God was teaching the people that without shedding of blood there is no
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:04.600]   remission of sin. So the Old Testament is full of these animal sacrifices and the high
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:10.000]   priest taking the blood into the presence of God in that innermost sanctuary of the
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.200]   tabernacle and of the temple. Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. The
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.400]   sins were put onto the animal. The animal was slain. His blood was taken in. God is
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.040]   teaching the people. He is looking forward to something.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:31.760]   Why did I read that 53rd chapter of Isaiah? Well, there is a prophecy concerning Jesus
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   Christ, the Messiah, the Deliverer. You noticed its terms, didn't you? The Chastisement
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:46.560]   of our peace was upon Him. Surely He hath borne our sins. He was bruised for our transgressions.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.120]   The Chastisement of our peace was upon Him. By His stripes we are healed. Here is the
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.600]   coming Messiah. Is He going to be a great king or a great personage? No, no. He will
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:03.000]   be like a root out of a dry ground, unexpected. And so He proved to be. He wasn't born in
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.640]   a king's palace. He was born in a stable. He wasn't born at the royal line, as it were.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:13.040]   He was born the son of a virgin. The men who looked after Him were a carpenter, born in
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.120]   poverty. They couldn't even afford a lamb, two turtle doves only. Did they give us an
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:25.000]   offering? Here it is being verified. Ah, but the centre, the soul of Isaiah 53 is that
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.120]   He shall make His soul an offering for sin. The same idea, you see.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:41.760]   And then He came. And I stand one afternoon by the side of John the Baptist, this extraordinarily
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:48.480]   fiery preacher. And he sees this Jesus coming and he points at Him and he says, "Behold,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.200]   there is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world. Men have been
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:02.960]   providing lambs hitherto. Now God has provided His own lamb. There He is. Behold, the Lamb
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:11.560]   of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world. Yes, says Christ in His own teaching,
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:20.480]   as mercy is lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:28.200]   and whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." He's got
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.040]   to be lifted up on a pole as that brazen serpent was lifted up. That's the way I'm going to
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.520]   save, he says.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.540]   And this, you see, is what is taught everywhere. Take how this apostle puts it in this very
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:51.480]   epistle to the Galatians, chapter 3, verse 13. Listen to this. "Christ hath redeemed
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:37:01.000]   us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, 'Cursed
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:12.040]   is every one that hangeth on a tree.'" What does he mean by this? Oh, here is the Bible's
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:21.920]   own explanation of all this terminology that sounds so strange to us. It is this. God in
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:38.200]   His holiness, in His purity in heaven, is offended by sin. It has hurt Him. It has wounded
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:49.080]   Him. And God hates sin. And God has pronounced a curse upon sin. He did it in the law that
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:57.400]   He gave to Moses. Christ, says Paul, therefore, has redeemed us from the curse of the law.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:03.040]   The law pronounces a curse upon us. It says, "If you remain in your sins, you are cursed,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.840]   you are damned, you will be destroyed, you will be punished everlastingly." The curse
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:21.800]   of God is upon sin. Sin must be punished. I say it with reverence, a holy God has no
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:29.640]   choice but to curse and to punish sin. And the curse that He has pronounced upon sin
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:40.320]   is death, death, destruction, everlasting punishment out of His sight. "The soul that
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:51.840]   sinneth, it shall die." That is God's curse upon sin. Very well then, my friend, that
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:59.280]   is the curse that is upon this present evil world and all who belong to it. That is the
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.680]   curse upon every one of us that is born into this world. We are born the children of wrath,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:13.520]   even as others, every one of us by nature. But if that curse descends upon us, that is
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:21.040]   the end. We die everlastingly outside the presence of God. Cannot we be delivered? Oh,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:33.000]   here is the message of the gospel. Christ, says Paul, has been made a curse for us. He
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.200]   came into the world in order that the curse that should have come upon us should come
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:57.400]   upon Him. He gave Himself for our sins. Yes, He came into the world to take our sins upon
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:04.680]   Himself. He was perfect, He was sinless, the law had no blemish in Him, no one could point
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:11.080]   a finger at Him, He never disobeyed God in anything. He was perfect, harmless, undefiled,
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:18.360]   without blemish, without sin, without fault, spotless Lamb of God. He took my sins upon
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:26.520]   Himself. That the curse that should come upon me came upon Him. He was made a curse for
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:39.840]   us. He took my place. He stood in my stead. He took my trial. He received my sentence
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:50.080]   upon His head has come the wrath, the curse that should have come upon me. He was condemned
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:41:08.760]   in my place, in my stead. God has punished my sins in Him who gave Himself for our sins.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:20.120]   Christ has been made a curse for us and thereby He delivers us from this present evil world.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.560]   He delivers us from the doom and the disaster and the judgment that is coming upon us. Having
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:42.120]   suffered the curse, He says that all who believe in Him will no longer be cursed. He died that
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:55.360]   we might be forgiven. He died to make us good. There was no other good enough to pay the
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:08.080]   price of sin. He only could unlock the gate of heaven and let us in. And this is the message
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:21.720]   of the gospel, that whosoever believes that the Son of God was made a curse for him or
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:30.480]   for her is delivered from the curse. Now my dear friend, on this Remembrance Night, let
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:41.800]   me put it plainly and clearly and as simply as I can. I am telling you this. I do not
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:48.360]   care how much you have sinned. You may be the greatest sinner in the universe at this
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.240]   moment. You may have committed every sin that is known to men. You may have repeated them,
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.720]   doubled them, trebled them. You may be as foul and as vile and as black and as ugly
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:10.920]   as sin can ever make a human wretch. But I say this to you, that if you realize your
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:21.760]   sinfulness, if you realize that your sin deserves the curse and the wrath of God, if you confess
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.840]   and acknowledge that to God, and if you believe this record which tells you that Christ has
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:33.520]   so loved you that he came all the way from heaven and went deliberately and voluntarily
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:40.120]   to that cruel death on the cross to be made a curse for you and to receive the punishment
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:46.200]   that you so richly deserved, if you believe that now, this minute, I tell you from this
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:54.400]   minute, you are forgiven. The curse of God will never descend upon you. You will have
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:01.400]   been separated from this present evil world, its way, its life, its influence, its doom,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:10.120]   its disaster and its destruction. You will be entirely forgiven. You will be reconciled
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:16.000]   to God. You will be made a child of God. You will be made an heir of his everlasting and
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.240]   eternal kingdom. And whatever happens in this life and in this world, whether war comes
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:34.560]   or not, you will be eternally safe because you will be in Christ and a citizen of the
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:44.880]   eternal kingdom. That is the message of salvation. That is the good news of the gospel. The world
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:54.880]   cannot be improved. You and I cannot be improved, but we can be saved. Saved from the wrath
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:02.200]   to come, saved from the curse of the law, saved from the righteous indignation of God
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:14.360]   upon sin and evil, saved for that life in glory beyond the veil, beyond this life and
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:24.160]   beyond death, saved for the blessings of eternity in the presence of God the Father, God the
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.480]   Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:33.200]   Oh, that you might see this. But you say, "Isn't that a harsh gospel? You are talking
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.440]   to us about the curse of God. I don't like this idea of the curse of God. I believe in
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.960]   the love of God." My dear friend, don't you see that it's here and here alone? You'll
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:52.280]   never begin to see the love of God. What is the love of God? Well, it's this. It is a
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:46:03.080]   love that is so great that he sent his only begotten Son into this world to be made a
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:14.160]   curse for you. And that is the love of Christ that he voluntarily gave himself to receive
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:18.960]   the punishment without grumbling or complaining. He didn't open his mouth like a lamb led to
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:28.680]   the slaughter. God visited upon him the punishment that should have come to us. That's the measure
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:38.120]   of the love of God. Not a love that winks at sin, but a love that is compatible with
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:44.560]   the holiness and the righteousness and the justice and the truth of God.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.040]   And that is what you should see as you look at that death on that cross. You should see
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:56.480]   the most glorious, the most amazing display of what? Of God's wrath against sin, of God's
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:05.120]   curse upon sin, God's holiness, justice, righteousness, truth, yes, and love and mercy
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:17.360]   and compassion all together without any contradiction. But all the attributes of God together and
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:27.200]   at one and the same time shining out in their eternal glory.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:37.800]   Oh, my dear friend, are you ready to face that death which is coming hourly nearer to
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   you? Are you ready to meet God? The world is doomed, and if you die belonging to the
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:48:05.000]   world, you will share and participate in the curse that will descend upon it. But you needn't.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:17.640]   Christ came into the world to be made a curse for you. And if you believe in him, you will
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:26.840]   be delivered this minute from the curse of the law and be reconciled to God. He gave
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:47.080]   himself for our sins, that in order that he might deliver us from this present evil world.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:53.440]   If you are not more concerned about your own soul and your death and your eternal destiny
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:58.720]   than you are about a possibility of a third world war and about the atomic bombs and the
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.560]   industrial position in this country and a thousand and one other questions, well, then
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:09.360]   I say, God have mercy upon you.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:21.720]   This message shows you the only way to be delivered from the curse. It was because Christ
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:33.880]   gave himself to be a curse for you. Repent, believe on him, give yourself to him, and
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:43.840]   be eternally safe. Amen.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.920]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
