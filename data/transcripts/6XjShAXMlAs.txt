[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.100]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.500]   and I'm the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.940]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.980]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle

[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.500]   Today, our special guest is Barry Ritholtz.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.380]   Barry has been around Wall Street for more than 25 years.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.380]   He's worked at several different capacities
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.460]   as a corporate lawyer, trader, research analyst,
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.860]   writer, book author,
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.820]   host of Bloomberg's Masters in Business podcast
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.060]   and the founder and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management.
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.740]   I've known Barry for many years
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.120]   and when I came up with the Bogleheads
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.740]   on Investing podcast idea,
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.440]   I contacted Barry and he generously gave his time
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.120]   to give me all the technical background
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.320]   on what I should be doing and how to launch.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.520]   I think you're really going to enjoy this conversation
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.080]   with Barry today.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120]   We're going to be talking about a lot of topics,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.600]   including investment strategy.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560]   During the podcast, I asked Barry to give us his views
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   on active management, market timing,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.300]   cyber currency trading,
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.560]   and a few other investment related topics.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.320]   This is not a debate about those topics.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.140]   It's an opportunity to learn what our guest knows
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.780]   and what he thinks.
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.720]   So with no further ado,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.680]   let me introduce my extra special guest, Barry Ritholtz.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.840]   Welcome, Barry.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.640]   - Thank you for having me, Rick.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.160]   - First of all, we'd like to wish you
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.460]   a happy 60th birthday, which was recently.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.640]   Congratulations.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.480]   - Thanks.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.140]   - You're five years away from Medicare.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.980]   - Yes.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.760]   So people say congratulations,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.160]   and really all I've done is avoid getting hit by a bus
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.320]   when crossing the street.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.200]   (laughing)
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.040]   - Okay.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.200]   - Can I tell you the best part about being 60?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.880]   - That you're not 70?
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   - Well, no, it's finding out all these people
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.960]   who are younger than me, but look terrible.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.800]   (laughing)
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.880]   And I'm not going to mention names,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.520]   but a handful of people said,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.240]   "Wow, I'll be there in a couple of years."
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.400]   And I'm like, "Really, dude?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000]   I thought you were like five years older than me."
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.280]   - Okay.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.900]   Secondly, I personally owe you a debt of gratitude
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900]   because this podcast was fashioned after your podcast,
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.500]   Masters in Business.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.620]   And when I was getting started with this,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.920]   the first person I contacted for pointers was you, Barry,
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.620]   and you gave me a lot of great pointers,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.260]   so I really appreciate that.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.100]   - My pleasure.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.020]   You know, after 400 of these or so,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.180]   you get to be not too terrible at them.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.760]   (laughing)
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.940]   - So let's find out about Barry.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.400]   I want to talk a lot about what's going on
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.360]   with your column and your blog and your business
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.120]   and so forth and your Masters of Business podcast,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.360]   all 400 of them.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.600]   But before we get to that, I want to go back further
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.640]   so that people know who you are,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.000]   a little bit about your background,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.920]   sort of far back as you'd like to go,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.280]   and we'll go from there.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.880]   - Really good in science and math in high school.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.040]   Managed to coast through that, go to college
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.120]   and suddenly learn, "Oh, you really got to work to do this."
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.880]   It's very competitive.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.200]   So I end up, after a couple of years
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.640]   of applied mathematics and physics,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.280]   switching to political science and philosophy,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.800]   finish school, don't know what to do, go to law school,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.240]   and when I actually go to register for the bar,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.440]   that's when I learned that I didn't graduate.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.920]   And after a convoluted series of legal sleight of hand,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.240]   managed to graduate college and law school the same day.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.000]   And, you know, practiced law for a couple of years,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.960]   loved law school, didn't really like the practice of law.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.880]   It was just granular and filled with minutiae
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.000]   and, you know, no pun intended,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.320]   I'm a big picture sort of guy.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.260]   And so ended up, when the opportunity came along,
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.040]   to join a firm that a friend was running
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.560]   that turned out to be the predecessor firm to E-Trade.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.720]   I did that, became a trader, and why don't we stop there?
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.120]   'Cause that brings us, you know, to the mid-90s.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.840]   - Okay, well, before we even get that far,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.080]   we have to dig into
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   some of the more interesting aspects of you.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.360]   And you were a member of the Stony Brook equestrian team,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.040]   and you successfully competed
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.000]   in the national championships back in 1981.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.740]   - So I am at Stony Brook.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.080]   I switched to poli-sci from, you know,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.660]   no more double physics lab
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.160]   and no more insane applied math homework.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.560]   And I find I have myself a little bit of time.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.080]   And one day I'm reading in the campus paper
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.040]   that Stony Brook has a competitive horseback riding team.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.240]   And I'm like, "What?"
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.440]   And not just competitive,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.960]   but, like, consistently national ranked
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   for, like, years and years.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.160]   So I wandered down to the barn.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.840]   I'm not exaggerating.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.280]   It's like a 20-minute walk from campus.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.640]   And I start talking to them.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.860]   Tell me about the team.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.700]   What do you do?
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.080]   What do you have to learn?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.480]   So I joined the riding team, and it was just fascinating.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.800]   It was a whole different sport,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.560]   a whole different set of rules.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.360]   And, you know, horseback riding is incredibly expensive
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.940]   and challenging area.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.680]   But as a student at a state school,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.400]   I got to ride for $5 a week.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.300]   And if that sounds cheap,
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.760]   even back in 1980, that was cheap.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.840]   So it was just great.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.960]   And I did that for a couple of years and just loved it.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.120]   It was a blast.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.440]   - Well, that's cool, though, that you did that.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.280]   - It was fun. - That's interesting.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.120]   - It was a lot of fun.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.940]   - Yeah.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.040]   You went through law school.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.000]   You did well.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   You were a cum laude, 3.56,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.720]   and you became a lawyer eventually.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   And you were in corporate law, too.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.600]   - So when you're at any decent-sized firm,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   whether you're doing corporate law
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.480]   or antitrust or litigation,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.560]   and you're entry-level,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.220]   you're in the library, you're in the stacks,
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.560]   you're just putting together research memos
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.520]   so the partners who are actually doing the real legal work,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.960]   you're saving them a lot of research and a lot of writing,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.140]   and you're giving them some groundwork.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.720]   And it's really a grinding, tedious existence.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   And I kind of recognize that I wasn't motivated enough
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.600]   to become a partner in a law firm
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.920]   to do that for seven to 10 years.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.280]   It's like, now look, the seven to 10 years
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.000]   are gonna go by no matter what you're doing.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.080]   But it was just an intimidating,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.640]   unpleasant view of your 20s and 30s,
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.320]   and I just couldn't bring myself to do that.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.560]   And so when the opportunity came
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.960]   to hit the eject button from the legal profession
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   and enter finance, I jumped at it.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.160]   - And you were a trader at one time,
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.680]   and were you trading your own account,
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.320]   or were you trading other people's accounts?
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   Tell us about that.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.840]   - You're trading three things.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.520]   A, if you have your own capital, you get to trade that,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.720]   but I was young and relatively broke.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.680]   B, you're trading other people's money.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.800]   And lastly, you're trading the firm's order flow.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.680]   So you can either go to the market
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   and just execute the trade in the market,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.800]   or if an order comes in and you think there's an advantage
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.760]   to trade around that order or take the position yourself
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.140]   and buy it cheaper or sell something
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.800]   and try and cover the trade at a different price,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.840]   you had the ability to operate around that.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.240]   And it's how you really learned how the market worked,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   more than trying to buy 10,000 shares of X
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.880]   and then sell it a point higher later in the day.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.320]   - Did you have your own clients?
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.160]   Were they giving you money to manage?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.200]   - In the beginning, it was mostly firm clients,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.080]   and then every now and then someone would say,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.920]   "Hey, I have some money.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.820]   "Do you want to trade this for me?"
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.320]   I was a very inconsistent trader.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.040]   I found I would make money some months
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.180]   and then give it all back the next month.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.180]   And in fact, that volatility of my own P&L,
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.400]   as well as, you know, you're sitting on a trading desk,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.960]   there's eight guys or 10 guys in a row.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.680]   And I was always astonished the guy on my right
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.640]   would be making money one month,
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.560]   while the guy on my left was losing money.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.800]   And then the next month, their roles reversed
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.180]   and suddenly the previous month's loser is killing it
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.660]   and the previous month's winner,
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.900]   whatever he touches goes to hell.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.820]   And between that sort of volatility
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.380]   and my own inconsistent trading
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.260]   kind of sent me down the rabbit hole
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.620]   of behavioral finance in the mid '90s,
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.940]   before all the cool kids were doing it.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.500]   'Cause I couldn't find a rational explanation
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.940]   for why Shecky on my left was doing well this month
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.720]   and Bob on my right wasn't,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.000]   they seemed to be doing the exact same thing.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.500]   And over time, you kind of learn,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.400]   it looks like they're doing the same thing,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.800]   but they're actually doing different things
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.680]   from an emotional, psychological perspective.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   And that had an immense impact on their trading success.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.720]   - You know, it's interesting that one of the very first
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.800]   people that you interviewed was Jack Schwager,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.340]   who wrote a book called "Market Wizards,"
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.020]   interviews with top traders.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.340]   And in fact, you interviewed him recently as well.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.700]   And I listened to that interview
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.340]   and he was talking about people who give money to traders
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.100]   and who does well with it and who does not.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.860]   Could you comment on both of those interviews,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.500]   the very first one that you did
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.140]   and then the more recent one?
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:28.100]   - So the first book that Schwager wrote, "Market Wizards,"
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.060]   ostensibly, it's about trading.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.100]   But as you work your way through the book,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.380]   really, it's a behavioral finance book.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.600]   That was the first book I read about trading.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.340]   "Market Wizards" is all about things like discipline
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.160]   and understanding stop losses and risk management
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.960]   and overconfidence.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.200]   And as you go back and reread the first book,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.760]   and you'll be astonished,
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.440]   some of the traders are futures traders,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.920]   some are bond traders, some are stock traders,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   some are derivative traders,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   all these people in different fields.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.440]   The key takeaway I got from that book
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.240]   was the single biggest variable
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.360]   with the largest impact on your results
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.540]   that is within your control is your own behavior.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.280]   That was the big takeaway.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.560]   And not only did I find the book fascinating,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.520]   but in the back of my head
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.920]   when I was first pitching "Masters in Business"
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.680]   to Bloomberg, "Market Wizards" was very much on my mind.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.080]   The thought process was,
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.320]   hey, let's find some of these really successful people,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.800]   accomplished, intelligent people
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.320]   who have put together not just a track record,
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.760]   but a methodology and a philosophy
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.600]   that will be beneficial to the listener
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.920]   and have an intelligent adult conversation.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.160]   I don't wanna ask them what their favorite stock is.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.400]   And I wanna ask them when the Fed's gonna raise,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.560]   where the market will be from here a year from now.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.680]   I wanna ask them, who are you and how did you get that way?
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.440]   Tell me about how you started to come up
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.760]   as a research analyst and a writer
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.240]   and how that evolved into
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.440]   doing the "Masters in Business" podcast.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.200]   I tend to be very scattershot,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.500]   easily distracted, lack of focus.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.640]   And in my saving graces,
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.360]   I have a degree of self-awareness
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.000]   of my lack of organizational skills.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.280]   And so to compensate or overcompensate for that,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.480]   I would each day write down,
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.280]   here are the earnings that are scheduled to be released.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.720]   Here's the various economic releases that are coming out.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.240]   Here are a series of stocks
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.080]   that are on the precipice of a breakout or a breakdown.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.800]   And I just put together like a whole run of things
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.720]   that I thought were really interesting.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.840]   And then I would tape it to my computer monitor.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.080]   It started out like three by five cards
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.360]   and then it became the bigger four by six cards.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.800]   And then eventually it was a full page.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.360]   And once it became a full page,
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.440]   people had asked me, "Hey, can I make a copy of that?"
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.840]   And what started out being Xeroxed
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.680]   and circulated around the office,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.140]   started getting faxed around town.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.540]   And then eventually it became a Yahoo GeoCities thing.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.320]   I would take all my notes and post them online.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   Not that anybody was paying attention back in 1998.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.520]   And then eventually it became a pretty substantial email list
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.600]   which eventually became the blog,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.580]   eventually became the big picture.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.580]   And street.com was 2002, three, four.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.040]   The Washington Post started publishing me 2010, 2011,
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.160]   something like that.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.120]   And then Bloomberg started in the fall of 2013.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.960]   A lot of this just began because,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.400]   hey, I'm really disorganized
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.600]   and I need to get my act together each day
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.280]   and just have a sense of what's going on.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.240]   And writing it out, typing it out
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.460]   was just a useful exercise.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.800]   - Well, I'm just amazed that when I read this email
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.360]   that you send out and the weekend reads and all of that,
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.040]   how in-depth you get.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.400]   You must be reading constantly.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.520]   - Yeah, there's a surprising method to the madness.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.640]   When I first began in the industry,
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.920]   I thought my role was to be an omnivore
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.080]   and consume everything there was.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.600]   And eventually you kind of learn addition via subtraction
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.040]   and information hygiene becomes really important.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.400]   There's a handful of pretty well-known writers
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.880]   and other media personality
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.440]   that I think are hot death warmed over,
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.280]   that they're consistently wrong
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.000]   or when they're right, they're lucky
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.600]   or they're right for the wrong reason.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.360]   And I just don't want those people in my thought process.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.380]   And so there are a number of publications
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.960]   and a number of folks that I have found to be
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.800]   very click baity, but useless.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.960]   So they get removed from the source.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.320]   And at this point, like in the morning,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.120]   I open up 50 different tabs and I work my way through them.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.000]   And I open up far fewer late in the afternoon,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.120]   but after doing this for 25 years,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.600]   20 years anyway, you find that it takes a sentence or two
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.480]   and you can quickly identify if something is terrible.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.280]   There's also a run of folks from Jesse Eisinger
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.160]   to Morgan Housel, to Derek Thompson,
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.040]   to Jason Zweig, to Dan Gross.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.600]   I probably have about 30 people,
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.040]   Mike Hiltzik at the LA Times,
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   that anything they put out, I'm absolutely gonna read
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.400]   'cause it's so consistently good.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   And so once you have your team of all stars,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.860]   suddenly it becomes much easier.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.960]   And the trick of 10 is that it forces you
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.360]   to really curate, to really make difficult decisions.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.400]   So when I said there's a method to the madness,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.680]   on any given day, the weekends are a little different
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.700]   'cause I try and do something.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.120]   Saturday is long form and Sunday I go on my way
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.760]   to look at really terrible policy decisions or errors.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.480]   'Cause I don't wanna look at them all week,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.500]   it's so negative, it's such a buzzkill.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.760]   But on Sunday it's like, all right,
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.600]   here's all the terrible stuff,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.160]   go to church and beg for forgiveness
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.720]   'cause all you people are just awful
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.780]   and here are the things you did.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.240]   So I kind of push all that negativity to Sunday.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.600]   But during the week it's pretty much,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.480]   starts out with a broad market or investing concept.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.600]   Sometimes it'll be something about trading
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.280]   or some specific ETF or product or something like that.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.520]   If I find something on retirement, 401Ks,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.440]   that kind of works its way there.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.560]   Very often I'll put something industry related
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.520]   in the fourth slot.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.320]   Real estate is a big part of the world,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.000]   so when there's an interesting real estate story,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.240]   it shows up.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   Then comes whatever technology or venture capital
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.620]   or new trend shows up.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.700]   If I find something interesting involving
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.080]   either behavioral finance or information hygiene,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.280]   something that makes people think carefully
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.800]   about what they're consuming, that'll find its way in.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.000]   I leave the last two or three slots
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   for a rotating mix of science or the last spot,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.800]   sports, music, entertainment is a slot.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.080]   Every now and then there'll be an interesting article
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.640]   about politics and what I mean by that
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.800]   is not the partisan bickering nonsense,
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.160]   but when I find something that,
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.000]   I love when someone forces me to rethink my views
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.160]   or uses data to challenge an underlying belief.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.860]   So this is a perfect example.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.720]   Terry McAuliffe bet on voters hating Trump.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.160]   Turns out they dislike Democrats more.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   Like that sort of flip where the obvious theme
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.520]   gets turned on its head and in an unexpected way,
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.280]   I'm fascinated by that.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.880]   I'm pretty convinced that all of us
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.800]   just live in a world of our own biases and illusions
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.220]   and confirmation bias.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.480]   And anytime I have the opportunity to prove to others
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.980]   or myself, hey, this deep fundamental thing you believe
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.040]   is wrong and here's proof.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.620]   Now go rethink your entire world philosophy.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.080]   That's useful, not just as a person, but as an investor,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.600]   it forces you to not take anything for granted
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.460]   and to carefully think about what you assume
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.920]   and what you believe is true.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.480]   So if one of our listeners today decided
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.280]   they wanted to start to get this information from you
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.840]   on a daily basis, how would they do that?
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.800]   So go to rithults.com.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.080]   You can scroll through to any of the reads
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.520]   and you'll click on a signup sheet.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.360]   I just actually told someone today that because of inflation
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.400]   our free newsletter has doubled in price.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   And so you can sign up for two times the regular free price.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.280]   That's a good Boglehead price, by the way.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.400]   We like that.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.920]   You also wrote a book called "Bailout Nation,
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.020]   How Greed and Easy Money Corrupted Wall Street
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.840]   and Shook the World Economy."
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.760]   Tell us about the book.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.940]   Why did you write it and what it's about?
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.920]   So another really long story I'll try and make short.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.880]   Bill Fleckenstein wrote the book "Greenspan's Bubbles"
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.300]   and that did really well for a business book.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.120]   And so when McGraw Hill came back to him and said,
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.280]   "All right, Bear Stearns just went belly up.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.160]   Let's write about them."
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.800]   He was like, "Thanks, but no thanks."
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.880]   And they asked him, "Well, who's covering that?"
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.720]   And he goes, "Oh, that's easy.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.640]   Rithults has been screaming about Bear Stearns for months.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.480]   Go talk to him."
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   I ended up turning them down, I don't know, eight times.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.080]   And every time I turned them down,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.840]   I would give them an excuse.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.160]   And each time they would address that excuse.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.540]   And so that turned out to be really fortuitous
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.800]   because at the end of the year,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.560]   when McGraw Hill was unhappy about the manuscript
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.460]   I gave them that had a very critical chapter
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.780]   about S&P Ratings Agency, a McGraw Hill company,
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.780]   well, I had already gotten final edit in my contract
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.320]   because I said to them, "I don't need to work with you.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.820]   I got a very large platform.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.280]   Why do I need to write a book for you
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.360]   and have you muck it up with your editors?
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.960]   I know what I want to say, leave me alone."
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.040]   And they're like, "Oh, we'll give you final cut."
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.760]   That was kind of like the last objection.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.020]   Again, long story short, I pulled the manuscript.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.180]   I gave them an updated chapter on McGraw Hill,
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.300]   which was much less hysterical, hair on fire,
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.540]   the world's coming to an end,
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.820]   and much more data-based and calm,
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.480]   which coincidentally had the unintended consequence
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.740]   of being much more devastating to S&P
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.860]   than the original, like it would have been very easy
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.100]   to say, "Oh, this guy's crazy."
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.500]   The rewritten chapter was, "Oh, that's a lot of data.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.820]   Ooh, those guys did what?
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.820]   Oh, wow, that's just terrible."
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.300]   So I made it far less histrionic
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.920]   and more factual and data-driven,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.980]   and it made it more devastating,
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.100]   and they refused to accept that one.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.260]   And so I pulled the book, put it up for auction,
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.540]   and it ended up, Wiley ended up buying it.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.220]   It turned out to be a successful partnership.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.180]   We sold a decent amount of copies.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.220]   I don't remember the exact number,
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.740]   but it was somewhere north of 30,000.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.340]   Again, for a business book, is really pretty good.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.660]   Then eventually, let's circle around to
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.100]   your master's in business,
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.460]   which I think you've probably become the most famous for
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.980]   in many ways because of the guests that you interview.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.180]   And one of the Bogleheads was asking,
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.900]   "Can you talk about your most memorable guests?"
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.120]   Good, bad, or indifferent,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.820]   but they were the most memorable.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.980]   So I'll give you a good one and a bad one.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.700]   Well, let's start with the bad one.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.300]   The bad one was somebody who had written a book
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.020]   and had kind of become famous,
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.220]   but he had just continuously blown up,
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.700]   like made a fortune, blew up, made a fortune, blew up.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.500]   Well, that could be anybody, I mean.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.540]   Not at this level.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.540]   It's one thing to say,
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.740]   "Oh, look, I got $100,000 in my 401(k).
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.420]   "Oh, it's 25,000."
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.340]   It's something else to say,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.580]   "I'm worth tens of millions of dollars."
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.180]   And it's like, "Shit, where'd it all go?"
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.540]   And do the same thing over and over again.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.380]   And when I had a conversation with him,
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.780]   he spoke in a normal cadence.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.660]   I thought that would be a pretty interesting interview.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.660]   And instead, each question was greeted with a heavy sigh,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:59.380]   and a, "Ahh, let me, uh, uh-huh."
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.820]   And then he would answer the question.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.700]   And so a 90-minute interview
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.860]   was about 45 minutes of material,
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.100]   and 45 minutes of someone
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.140]   that it seemed like a cry for help.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.420]   And maybe 15 minutes into the interview,
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.760]   I have the producer in my ear going,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.000]   "None of this is usable.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.820]   "Let's just throw him out and be done with it."
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.260]   But what we eventually did
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.140]   was just edit out all of those gaps,
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.300]   and it became what sounded like a normal interview.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.420]   But when you're experiencing it,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   it was just like, "Do I need to call
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.860]   "a mental health hotline?
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.660]   "Is this person a danger to himself?"
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.460]   I mean, I guess I forced him to think about things
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.540]   he hadn't thought about for decades.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.000]   And so it was really, so that was the worst one.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.420]   The best one, and I'm gonna call out Mike Batnick
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.780]   about this, 'cause he gave me so much grief about this.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.260]   About five years ago, I thought,
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.220]   on the 15th anniversary or so of September 11th,
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.900]   it would be worthwhile to interview the special master
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.500]   from the 9/11 Fund, Ken Feinberg.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.780]   And he's a lawyer, he's kind of public.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.180]   It's been a long time since 9/11.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.060]   He hasn't really been out talking about it.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.300]   Maybe there's something interesting here.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.060]   - Just to clarify, this was the person
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.500]   who had to decide how the money
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.140]   was going to be divided from 9/11?
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.540]   - The congressional $8 billion allocation
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.500]   to the victims of September 11th, right.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.380]   So we do the interview, and two weeks later, it goes live.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.140]   And on that Monday, Mike walks in.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.800]   He's like, "I can't believe how wrong I was.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.580]   "That was amazing.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.000]   "There were several moments in that interview
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.180]   "where I wanted to cry and just give him a hug."
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.200]   I'm like, "Right, the guy is just amazing.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.940]   "It's an amazing story."
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.200]   And then five years later, now there's a movie,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.860]   and there's this, and there's that.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.740]   But that was just one of the most astonishing,
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.640]   just to be able to just gently nudge him along
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.260]   through discussing all these different things.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.380]   And of course, he's very intelligent.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.540]   He's very articulate.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.620]   He has an incredible breadth of,
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.740]   not just experience, but empathy.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.480]   And as a lawyer, there's a very specific formula
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.600]   that you basically operate off of
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.740]   when there's an accidental death
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.640]   and there's civil litigation.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.120]   There are all these different factors.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.160]   Yeah, there's pain and suffering,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.520]   and there's this, and there's that.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.040]   But the prime driver is the economic loss
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.200]   of future income to family.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.520]   And I know that's kind of crude and blunt,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.600]   but that's what's evolved over hundreds of years.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.480]   And so you end up with this really insane story.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.600]   I'll give you one.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.260]   It's a little disturbing,
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.160]   but he tells the story of the bond trader
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.660]   who jumped from the 105th floor of the World Trade Center,
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.680]   so he didn't burn to death,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.240]   and lands on a fireman, and of course they both die.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.760]   Now, the bond trader is making a million dollars a year,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.560]   and the fireman is making $100,000 a year.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.840]   Why are their lives worth so different amounts?
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.580]   And he had to come up with a way that got everybody,
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.980]   all of the families, all the estates, to buy into.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.560]   And talk about an impossible Solomonic task
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.120]   to split that baby.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.880]   This guy is a true American hero
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   who took on a impossible, thankless task
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.400]   and did it as well as anyone could have possibly hoped for.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.040]   A great and horrible story, right?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.440]   - Yes, I remember that story.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.640]   I remember that.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.480]   Let's go on to other masters in business,
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.940]   because you've done 400 of these.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.680]   I guess my question on this whole thing,
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.280]   you're interviewing all of these people
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.120]   who are the top of the top in their industry,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.040]   and some maybe who aren't so top, like me.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.560]   You interviewed me one time.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.640]   But other than that,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.280]   I mean, does this any of all of this help,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.240]   let's say a person who's trying to trade their account,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.560]   trade their portfolio, outperform the markets, if you will.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   Does any of all of these interviews help anyone do that?
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   - That's an interesting question.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.080]   When there is the opportunity to sit down
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.280]   and have an adult, thoughtful conversation
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.160]   with someone who has been incredibly successful,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.500]   both in finance and investing and in life,
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.560]   there are lessons to be learned there.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.200]   Basically, it's like a bookshelf,
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.560]   a library of 400 books about everything
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.600]   from behavioral finance, to investing,
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   to technology, to venture capital, to psychology,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   to go down the whole list.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.960]   Hey, of those 400 books,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.920]   if you can't find a little something
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.320]   that makes you a little smarter, a little more thoughtful,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.120]   a little more aware of your limitations,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   and teaches you how to take better advantage of your skills,
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.640]   you're doing something wrong.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   I mean, there's no magic bullet, but dear Lord,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   Howard Marks and Ray Dalio and the head of fixed income
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.240]   at Double Line and PIMCO
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.440]   and the head of private equity at Blackstone,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.480]   and just go down the list.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.720]   There's so much to learn from these people.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.240]   And I mean, I used to say, I'll let you in on a little secret
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.460]   but I've said this enough times
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.120]   that it's no longer a secret.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.600]   I do these for an audience of one.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.720]   I do this for myself
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.440]   'cause I have the opportunity to get a Richard Thaler
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.360]   or a Danny Kahneman, and I'm gonna spend 90 minutes
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.680]   sucking as much knowledge out of them into me.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.080]   And anybody who's listening
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.080]   should be able to figure out something.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.560]   Think about Bill McNabb.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.800]   I think I interviewed him three times.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.320]   Or Jack Bogle, to say the least.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.520]   Bogle was a fascinating conversationalist
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.920]   and he plowed straight through for 90 minutes.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   That's just an astonishing, astonishing moment in time.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.720]   And I know for a fact
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.920]   that there's something to be learned from these
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.800]   because I get emails all the time
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.840]   from business school professors
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   who assign these out as class projects in MBA classes.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.580]   I mean, there's a ton of stuff to be learned here.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.320]   You just have to be thoughtful
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.320]   and approach the topics with a little skepticism.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.040]   I'm not gonna tell you
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.160]   that everything said by every person is gold
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.240]   and is guaranteed to make you money,
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:26.140]   but if you can find some useful information, some ideas,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.280]   not the usual TV, buy this, sell that,
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   'cause that's got a shelf life of about 30 seconds,
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.320]   but things about methodology
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.560]   and how to create a mental model
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.480]   that allows you to deal with certain changes in the market,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.160]   or how to deal with adversity
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   and brush yourself off and keep going.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.000]   Or one of the things I love about the Ray Dalio interview,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.240]   his whole career is based on recognizing,
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.560]   oh, I'm wrong and I'm gonna be wrong frequently.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.320]   How can I take these strikeouts at bat
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.900]   and become a better hitter?
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.900]   Like, his entire career is expect to be wrong,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.600]   but if you just leave it there,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.960]   you're gonna be wrong regularly.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.600]   If you expect to be wrong
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.560]   and then learn something about why you were wrong
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.720]   and what you should do differently next time
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.360]   and incorporate that into your thinking process
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.080]   and incorporate that into the way you invest in trade,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.480]   and so each time you're wrong,
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.640]   it should make you a little better,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.480]   I mean, that's gold, Jerry, gold.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.980]   I don't know how somebody can hear any of that conversation
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.160]   and not come away better for it.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.320]   Well, thank you, Barry.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.620]   I mean, you get into these interviews
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.360]   and you start asking questions,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.700]   and it's always fascinating to listen to some of the answers
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.860]   because it's just so insightful.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.500]   Gotta kind of move along here to something that you said,
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.780]   and I twisted it a little bit, quite frankly,
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.420]   but I was listening to you,
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.600]   I can't remember, you were on a podcast somewhere.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   You were talking about news and the dissemination of news,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.440]   and you were talking about how a lot of news
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.060]   has way too much weighting in people's minds
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.760]   than it's actually worth,
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.680]   and what I took away from that
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.880]   was that news is equal-weighted,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.920]   but the stock market is cap-weighted.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.800]   Sure, so there are two things
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.260]   that speak directly to that philosophy.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.700]   One was a series of pieces I did for the Washington Post
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.940]   about signal-to-noise ratio
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.420]   and how to get more signal and less noise,
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.140]   and generally, this is part of that evolution
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.980]   from omnivore to very selective,
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.260]   Michelin star-rated restaurant consumer.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.260]   When I was younger, I would eat anything.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.100]   When you're older, you're kind of like,
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.980]   oh, maybe I should be a little more selective,
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.960]   and so what ends up happening
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.720]   is you really become choosing
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.080]   in what you consume in terms of information,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.600]   so that was sort of the setup,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.120]   and that was a couple of, you know, five years ago.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.880]   Last summer, the summer of 2020,
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.280]   so I do these quarterly calls for clients,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.240]   and we try and keep it under a half hour,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.000]   you know, two or three dozen charts,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.600]   and we just click through a lot of them,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.400]   and basically, a lot of this comes from questions
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.880]   from clients and advisors,
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.800]   and most of it is nonsense we hear on TV and elsewhere.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.700]   Like, a perfect example would be stagflation.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.080]   You know, more recently,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.400]   people are talking about stagflation.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.080]   Well, go back and look at the data,
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.240]   and the 1970s and the 2020s are not even remotely similar
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.120]   on any of the data points that would relate to that,
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.200]   so over the summer of 2020,
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.740]   when the market was, you know,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.560]   not only off the lows set at the end of March,
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.880]   but by August, it regained the previous highs
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.120]   and kept going,
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.160]   the question we kept hearing over and over again is,
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.240]   you know, I look around, and the economy looks terrible,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.920]   and yet the market goes higher and higher.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.960]   This doesn't make any sense.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.840]   I'm really perplexed, and I want to liquidate my portfolio,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.200]   so we looked into this and said,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.520]   okay, let's see how realistic this assessment is,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.520]   and so when you look around your neighborhood,
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.820]   you see a bunch of restaurants and a bunch of dry cleaners
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.240]   and a bunch of retail stores,
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.960]   and they're all doing really poorly
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.900]   in the middle of a pandemic,
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.960]   but for the most part,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.360]   none of those companies are publicly traded.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.560]   They're relatively, not just small business,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.340]   I mean, they're really small businesses.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.480]   They're tiny and not related
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.520]   to anything that's publicly traded.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.040]   Hey, what's doing well?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.440]   Well, it was Netflix and Apple and Amazon and Microsoft
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   and Zoom and Google and Facebook
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.360]   and all the big tech companies,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.260]   and wait a second, these are global companies
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.000]   that allow everybody who was stuck at home
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.660]   during the pandemic to work remotely,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.480]   and not only are they not suffering,
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.480]   their business is up significantly from the previous year.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.200]   Well, of course they're doing well,
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.960]   and so the next step, and again,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.640]   my secret weapon, Michael Batnick,
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.780]   runs through all the different sectors
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.480]   and subsectors of the S&P 500,
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.080]   and we end up looking at things
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.640]   on a market cap weighted basis.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.360]   So the big six, the FANG,
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.560]   or I don't even know what you call them now,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.280]   that Facebook is meta, the mama stocks,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.920]   those companies are like 25% of the S&P 500.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.760]   You look at airline stocks, they're less than a percent.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.920]   Hotel stocks, they're less than a percent.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.840]   Even the vertically integrated energy companies,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.240]   because gasoline sales were down,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.320]   even those stocks are like one or 2%.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.000]   In fact, you could take,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.280]   I think it was the bottom 50 sectors
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.820]   out of a few hundred sectors
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.520]   when you break them down into the,
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.200]   not the seven big industry groups,
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.140]   but the subsectors and sub-subsectors.
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.560]   If you eliminated the bottom 50 sectors
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.800]   from the S&P 500, right,
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.900]   hospitality and entertainment and all these things,
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   it turned out to be 6% of the entire value of the S&P 500.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.780]   And so that makes perfect sense.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.580]   It turns out the market is rational.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.980]   The big cap technology stocks
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.640]   that were thriving and global in nature,
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.460]   they were doing really well.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.660]   And all the little companies,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:32.180]   and they were either not public or so small
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.860]   that it was almost irrelevant to the S&P 500.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.380]   And so when you look at it in that way,
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.340]   it makes perfect sense.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.380]   Now, when you look at your local dry cleaner
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.580]   and the little antique store that had to shut down
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.180]   and they're closed and out of business,
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.260]   and yet the market goes higher and higher,
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.700]   that makes no sense.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.440]   But those aren't even market cap weighted.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.700]   Those are just, wow, that's a shame
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.660]   that those companies went out of business,
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.820]   but that's not the same as
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.100]   why is the market going higher and higher?
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.700]   And the answer was big companies were doing really well
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.040]   and your local neighborhood shops are not in the S&P 500.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.520]   Now, so basically, like I said, news is equal weighted.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.360]   We get hit with all of this.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.560]   And it's like, this is terrible.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.400]   This is horrible.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.560]   How can the market be going up
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.760]   with oil prices going up and so forth?
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.520]   The bottom line is that it's just not a big factor.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.960]   But the news makes it,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.320]   you get the same amount of the news
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.920]   about all of these other things
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.460]   that are not really a factor in the cap weighted index,
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.200]   because they are a big company.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.560]   Maybe we should be paying attention
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.000]   to what's going on in Google.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.600]   But should we be even paying attention
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.200]   to a gas pipeline company or not?
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.080]   Maybe not.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.440]   It's certainly, it's not gonna affect your index fund.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.300]   So that's exactly right.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.040]   I just used this expression today
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.920]   and I'm gonna repeat it 'cause I just love it.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.240]   The days are long, but the decades are short.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.420]   That is the fascinating expression
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.440]   that sums up how humans experience time.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.260]   We live in the here and now, right?
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.100]   Our memories are these fallible,
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.860]   you know, nostalgic, tinged,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.860]   air laden re-imaginings of the way the world was.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.860]   That's the past.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.740]   And the future is some combination of wishful thinking
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.980]   and hopes and dreams and imagining how it's gonna be.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.120]   But neither of those really are relevant.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.800]   We exist in the here and now, in the moment,
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.160]   and that's why these day-to-day just distractions,
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.040]   just, you know, it's noise
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.400]   and people get so sucked in by the noise.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.680]   Okay, we're gonna drill down more now
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.120]   into portfolio management.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.480]   And so all the next topics that I'm gonna talk about
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.640]   are going to be portfolio management topics.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.880]   So maybe you could give us, you know,
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.180]   a couple of minutes on each one of these
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.620]   as I hit these topics.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.100]   So the first one, a 70/30 portfolio,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.640]   70% stocks, 30% bonds is the new 60/40.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:18.140]   In other words, you know, the 60/40 of 60% stock, 40% bonds.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.440]   Do you think that people need
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.940]   to have more equity exposure now?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.340]   So there's two factors that are driving this.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.980]   Interest rates are part of it.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.500]   Bonds serve two purposes in a portfolio.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.780]   One is to throw off some yields,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.980]   and the other is to provide some ballast
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.820]   to offset the volatility of equity markets.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.820]   And so you're not getting the yield
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.260]   that we're used to on the bond side.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.280]   And so you have to take a little more risk
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.780]   in order to generate similar returns.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.460]   And one way to do that is 70/30.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.140]   But that's only one of the two factors
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.380]   that I think are most important in driving this.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.380]   The other factor is that for the investor class,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.500]   and I can't believe I have to use that preface,
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.540]   but for most of the people who are saving for retirement
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.320]   and have a 401(k),
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.860]   their lifespans have continued to extend.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.340]   And mid-80s is really not uncommon anymore.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.540]   I mean, not everybody gets to live to 100,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.540]   but the old days of having a life expectancy of 72,
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.260]   those are long behind us.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:29.260]   And you have to make sure your money is going to last you
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.160]   throughout the entire retirement.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.300]   And people generally are working later.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.060]   They may be working, throttling back to part-time,
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.420]   but they're working later in their lives.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.700]   Their retirement is more active.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.460]   They're doing more things and spending more money
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.500]   in that part of their life.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.520]   And then the cost of healthcare has just continued to go up.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.460]   And so the way to achieve the short returns
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.980]   that seem to be rational for that group of folks
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.920]   is not to go too far out on the credit curve
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.100]   or the duration curve or the risk curve,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.520]   and not to go 90/10 or anything crazy,
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.700]   but to move from 60/40 to 70/30
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.580]   is a pretty reasonable shift,
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.380]   because today's 70-year-olds
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.820]   are really the 60-year-olds of 30 years ago.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.480]   - Is a 3% withdrawal rate the safe number now,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.640]   or is it still 4%?
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.680]   - You know, one of the interviews I did
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.420]   was with William Sharpe,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.600]   and he called this the most challenging question
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.560]   in all of finance.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.240]   And he said, you know, we use 4%
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.000]   'cause it plus or minus seems to work,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.120]   not that there's any mathematical basis for it.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.240]   It's not a terrible number.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.960]   I don't know if the 3% number is,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.680]   it clearly would give you a longer runway
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.280]   on that drawdown,
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.680]   but if you can't live on 3%,
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.200]   well then, you know, you may not have a choice.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.280]   I'm relatively comfortable with 4%.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.080]   I haven't seen anything conclusive
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.840]   that says 4% is problematic.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.240]   So for now, I'm gonna stay with that,
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.920]   but I certainly think somebody will eventually
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.160]   come up with a number that is more defendable
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.720]   and mathematically valid.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.200]   And if someone were to say to me,
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.760]   listen, I'm concerned about running out of money
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.440]   in my retirement and 4% is too much,
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.500]   3.5% is not a terribly unreasonable number.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:47.160]   - So the next question, and Aboglehead had this question,
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.320]   is active versus passive.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.560]   How do you feel about A, all active,
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.240]   B, all passive, or C, somewhere in the middle?
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.800]   - So the problem with all active is pretty obvious.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.320]   First, you don't know who the good active managers are
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.200]   until after the fact.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.680]   And even if you started investing
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.920]   with some of the best active managers in the world,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.760]   there's no guarantee
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.000]   that they're gonna continue that streak
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.360]   very few of them have.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.320]   But a handful of people have done
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   really, really well over time,
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.040]   and more so than can be explained by mere luck.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.080]   There are some really skillful managers.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.960]   So that's the first issue.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.360]   The second issue is clearly cost.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.820]   When you look at a lot of active managers,
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.080]   some of them aren't consistently outperforming,
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.940]   and so they don't justify the cost of entry.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.240]   And lots of them are closet indexers.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.440]   And so, you know, come for the high fees,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.280]   stay for the beta-like performance.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.080]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.640]   However, I interviewed recently Robbins Wiggleworth,
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.100]   who wrote the book Trillions,
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.760]   and basically gives the history of indexing.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   And it's kind of interesting
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.840]   that he throws certain firms like DFA
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.320]   into the index basis, so into that pile.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.260]   And so, I don't know.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.560]   I think if you're gonna have a value or a momentum
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.400]   or a small cap or a quality bias,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.000]   to me, that decision seems to be a little bit active.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.180]   But if you wanna have 25% of your portfolio
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.400]   with that sort of bias,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.660]   I can't say that's the worst thing in the world.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.440]   You're putting a little money at risk
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.720]   on the possibility of outperforming,
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.600]   but you're paying a low fee,
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.820]   and there's a lot of academic research that supports it.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.480]   Or if you wanted to, if someone said to me,
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.620]   "Hey, I wanna have 10 or 20% of my portfolio
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.720]   "in Fidelity's Will Danhoff's fund
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.640]   "or Warren Buffett's, Berkshire,
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.120]   "or go down the list of some of these people
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.440]   "who have just put up incredible numbers for decades,"
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.280]   I wouldn't object to that.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.760]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.460]   Now, if you wanna put all of your money into one fund,
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.680]   that seems imprudent.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.440]   And if you wanted to go 100% active
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.300]   across six different managers,
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.200]   it seems like that's a recipe
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.960]   for expensive underperformance.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.120]   You know, 100% indexing is the easy way.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.600]   And so somewhere in between,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.240]   you know, even Vanguard is, what, 25%, 30% active now?
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.680]   So I'm okay if someone wants to have a reasonable amount
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.480]   of their portfolio in active equity or factor-based equity.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.720]   And it has to be very long-term.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.760]   I mean, this is not a trade
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.480]   going into some sort of a factor fund.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.840]   Somebody's gonna go with a small-cap value tilt.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.720]   And so it's gotta be a 25-year thing.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.560]   It better be, 'cause the past decade,
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.600]   small-cap value has just stunk the joint up.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.200]   Okay, let's go to the next thing.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.520]   Tactical asset allocation.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.720]   I mean, is it possible, I'm not gonna say possible.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.840]   It is always possible.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.840]   But is it probable that someone can outperform
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.640]   in either risk-adjusted or nominally
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.200]   by timing the markets?
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.120]   It's a really complicated answer.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.360]   Short answer, a handful of people
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.480]   have had to put together a good track record.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.720]   Real-world answer, the value of tactical,
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.720]   at least as we do it, is not to outperform the market.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.600]   The value of tactical is to have a small slug of money
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.280]   that, from a behavioral finance and emotional perspective,
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.560]   allows you to leave your real money alone.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.720]   And so, perfect example, we were talking about 60/40.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.760]   If you have a 60/40 portfolio
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.040]   for 4/5 of your investable assets,
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.280]   and then you have a tactical portfolio for the last 20%,
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.800]   and it doesn't have to be great,
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.160]   it just has to be pretty good,
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.180]   so that in an environment like last year,
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.900]   it doesn't have to get out at the exact top,
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.320]   it doesn't have to get in at the exact bottom.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.000]   But if in 2020, let's say you missed,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.760]   rollover started somewhere in the middle of February.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.560]   If you got out of the way for most of March,
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.800]   and you missed the April re-entry,
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.640]   and you didn't get back in until May,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.080]   you're gonna underperform the S&P.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   But if that portfolio goes to 80% bonds
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.240]   or 100% bonds during the month of March
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   when the S&P fell 30%,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.200]   and you left the rest of your portfolio alone,
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.000]   'cause you could rationalize it by saying,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.400]   all right, I was 70/30, now I'm 50/50,
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.360]   and down 30% means my portfolio's down 15%,
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.920]   I could live with that,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.560]   and then eventually you get back into equities
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.760]   on a rule-based system,
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.000]   it will have served its emotional release valve purpose.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.340]   I don't know a lot of firms that behave that way.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.700]   Rit Holt's Wealth Management does.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.800]   That was the whole thinking behind
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.700]   creating our own in-house tactical.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.520]   Have it be a trend-based system, have it be rules-based.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.380]   It's not Barry rubbing his chin saying,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.120]   now's the time to get in, now's the time to get out.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.520]   So having a rules-based system
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.620]   that operates as a release valve,
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.840]   you don't have to miss 57% down in '08, '09.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.280]   But if you miss 30 or 40% of it,
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.560]   people feel like they've done something,
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.880]   they're not just frozen in fear,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.840]   and all right, I'm gonna ride this out
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.640]   with my long-term asset classes,
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.060]   'cause I know equity will eventually come back,
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.460]   and this makes it a little less painful.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.340]   Now my personal trading account,
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.260]   that's nothing but Bitcoin and leveraged 100 to one,
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.640]   that's crushing it.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.860]   I'm sure it is.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.060]   All right, let's go on to the next thing.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:55.020]   One of the big areas of investing these days
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.440]   is ESG, Environmental, Social, and Governance,
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.460]   which is, to people who have been around a while,
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.660]   social responsible investing,
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.760]   only with some extras added on.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.860]   People who go down this path,
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.140]   should they expect better returns, worse returns,
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.420]   same returns, higher fees?
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.660]   Barry, what do you think?
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.820]   - So ESG is complicated, it's a little challenging,
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.980]   and I'll give you one example is,
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.980]   if you have a low-carbon portfolio,
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.300]   not a lot of energy or oil stocks,
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.300]   well, when the price of oil was falling,
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.340]   the ESG portfolio did well,
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.080]   because those stocks did poorly,
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.380]   and here we are, oil back over 83,
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.900]   so the oil stocks themselves are doing well,
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.680]   and a low-carbon ESG portfolio
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.140]   is gonna underperform relative to that.
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.500]   So I think that's the wrong way to think about it.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.680]   I think the right way to think about it is,
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.540]   first, you can use ESG as a screen
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.280]   to eliminate potentially risky companies,
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.740]   especially on the governance side.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.500]   The higher-ranked governance companies
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.860]   tend not to have the sort of me-too moments
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.780]   that so many other companies
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.420]   with poor corporate governance
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.540]   have found themselves getting into.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.000]   So that's number one.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Number two, thanks to software products like Canvas,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.820]   which is something we use, and direct indexing,
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.300]   you can really fine-tune the S&P 500
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.900]   and say, I don't want gun stocks,
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.660]   I don't want any companies that don't have
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.500]   at least one woman on their board of directors,
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.680]   and I don't want any companies
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.980]   that subsidize gambling or alcohol,
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.760]   or whatever is your personal preference.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.740]   And so the ability to be far more granular
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.480]   and specific today than the early days
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.860]   of socially responsible investing
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.980]   really allows people to be specific.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.300]   No animal cruelty, okay,
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.580]   let me pull that out of my index.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:02.140]   The ability to be that fine-tuned, that specific,
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.660]   is really, really impressive,
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:07.900]   and I think for some people that's a great way
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.660]   put your money into the market
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.740]   in a method that reflects your values.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.320]   And I think you just have to be willing to accept
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.100]   that maybe there's a performance cost, maybe not.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.220]   Okay, this is the big one now.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.820]   This is the last question before we wrap it up.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.900]   Cyber currencies, Bitcoin, Ether, all of these.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.620]   First of all, your overall comments about coins
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.660]   or cyber currencies as investments,
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.600]   and then if so, if you think they belong in a portfolio,
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.100]   how do you do it and how much?
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.780]   So really, really good question.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.060]   So first, it's challenging to look at a new technology
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:52.220]   come along and slowly develop a foundation
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.900]   and develop an infrastructure
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.300]   and develop an ecosystem around it and ignore it, right?
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.940]   I mean, as much as I respect Warren Buffett,
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.780]   when he said in the mid-90s and then again,
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.460]   you know, in the late 2000s,
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.260]   I don't really understand the internet or technology
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.780]   and I'm not investing there.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.820]   Well, good for him for sticking to his knitting,
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.220]   but he eventually became a huge Apple investor
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.140]   and left ungodly amounts of money on the table
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.580]   because what are you telling me?
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.540]   Apple is a value stock in 2013,
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.860]   but it wasn't a value stock in 2002
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.800]   when it was $15 with 13 cash
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.620]   and it just had to introduce this newfangled iPod,
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.180]   which was the forerunner of the iPhone.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.700]   So I always want to avoid the mistake of
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.900]   that's complicated, I don't understand it,
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.020]   and I'm not gonna take the time to learn about it
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.640]   and become a smarter investor.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.260]   So you really want to avoid that sort of,
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.060]   hey, you kids get off my lawn attitude.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:57.980]   So that's number one.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.300]   Number two, the crypto coins,
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:05.100]   as opposed to blockchain and the technology around it.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.780]   So generally speaking, crypto coins are a commodity
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:13.020]   and commodities are speculative trades,
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.560]   not really long-term investments.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.560]   However, there are people clamoring to put money into this.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.020]   My problem with things like Bitcoin
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.780]   is it's trading for trading's sake
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:33.780]   and the speculation around it seems to be far too much
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.380]   in a subgroup of this.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.340]   This isn't everybody.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.380]   This is the group that I think is very visible,
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:43.780]   is the Lambo, gonna buy some Bitcoin
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.300]   and then I'm gonna make so much money,
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.000]   they're gonna go buy me a Lambo.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.780]   Like that sort of approach to trading,
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.180]   not investing, to speculating,
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.940]   it's rife with problems and it has all sorts of issues.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.700]   And I think that is the sort of thing that you want to avoid.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.660]   Now, if you are of the belief that,
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.300]   hey, cryptocurrencies and blockchain
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.140]   and the whole infrastructure around it
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:14.140]   is internet 3.0 and smart contracts
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.140]   and this new technology,
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.020]   this is an opportunity to get into the internet
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.460]   circa late 1990s.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.020]   Okay, so the way to do that
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.340]   is to create some form of an index.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.540]   So you probably own some Bitcoin
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.740]   and some Ethereum is the next biggest coin
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:37.140]   and then another 10 or 20 coins after that.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.260]   So you're not gambling on this is the dogecoin of the day
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.780]   or this is the, what was the one that ran up 260%
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.540]   before collapsing to zero?
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.060]   That's just speculative nonsense.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.460]   You don't wanna play that game.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:54.520]   So rather than go for the lottery ticket,
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.900]   take an indexing approach.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.500]   It turned out Jack Bogle was right about that.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.380]   And if you wanna put 3% or 5% of your cash
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:07.460]   or your portfolio into that, I could live with that.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:12.180]   So 2017, we had a email come into the office.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.900]   I bought a whole bunch of Bitcoin in 2010.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.860]   It's worth $40 million today
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.780]   and I don't know what to do with myself.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.940]   Okay, this guy's a truck driver.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.680]   What do you wanna do with this?
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.660]   I don't know.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.780]   He wants to buy an island.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.460]   I remember that ad, he bought an island.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.020]   Right, that was the tow truck driver in the late 90s.
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:38.020]   But this was a Bitcoin investor in 2016 or '17
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.380]   who reached out to us and said,
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.100]   "Hey, I have $40 million worth of Bitcoin, what do I do?"
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.300]   And there's no upside to telling people what to do
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.260]   'cause if it works out, they're a genius
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.820]   and if it doesn't, you're an idiot.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.100]   And so I find that's a thankless task.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.420]   So rather than say, buy this, sell that,
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.060]   I like to tell people,
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.500]   well, put this in the context of regret minimization.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.500]   If you sell it and it goes up, how do you feel?
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.780]   I would feel terrible.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.660]   What if you don't sell it and it crumbles?
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.660]   I would feel terrible.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.420]   All right, so maybe you might wanna think
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.300]   about selling half and holding onto half,
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.540]   but $40 million is a lot of money.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.380]   Half of it, even after taxes, pays for your retirement,
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.620]   pays off your mortgage, pays your kid's college,
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.380]   pays their kid's college.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.140]   That's a lot of money to just keep in the merry-go-round
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.900]   and take a risk that it collapses.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.980]   So a rational approach is to try
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.740]   and create an index of crypto.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.780]   And if you give me a couple of months,
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.180]   I could probably cobble something together for you on this.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:47.180]   - Okay, now, at the end of all of your podcasts,
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.900]   you ask various questions to your guests.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.100]   And unfortunately, we're running out of time here,
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.980]   so I'm just gonna cut the three questions
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.820]   down to one question.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.640]   And then there's also another question
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.620]   that was really important to one of the Bogleheads,
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.900]   and I'll ask that one last.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.940]   So here's the question that I think would be helpful.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.780]   What advice would you give to a recent college graduate
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.340]   who is interested in coming into the investment industry?
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.860]   - So first, it's a fascinating industry,
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:20.580]   and it's in the middle of flux and it's very much changing.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.840]   So that's number one.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.580]   Number two, if you decide you wanna come into this industry,
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:31.380]   I would tell them not to worry about their first job,
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.460]   that it's really a stepping stone,
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.580]   and that the most important thing
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.740]   that I've learned in my career
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.520]   is that you have to develop and build a skillset
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.820]   that will serve you no matter what job you have.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.020]   And you just keep improving and becoming better and better,
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.620]   learning more and more, developing more skills.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:56.140]   Make yourself invaluable to your employer
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:00.660]   and to any employer who may wanna hire you in the future.
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.420]   And if you do that, you'll have a successful career
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.260]   no matter what you do.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.600]   - And the very last question, and this is an important one,
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.300]   you often talk about coffee in your,
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:15.180]   when you write and when you speak.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:19.580]   And so one reader was just dying to know,
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:22.500]   is it drip coffee, Keurig, French press,
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.340]   auto-drip, perc, pour over?
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.220]   I mean, what is it?
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:26.420]   How do you make your coffee?
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.780]   - Wow, wow.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.620]   So I have three main ways to make coffee.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:36.260]   Most days, it's the Breville grind and brew,
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.620]   which beans on this side, water goes in the middle,
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.700]   there's a timer, it goes off at 4.30 in the morning.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.100]   So when I roll out of bed, 10, 15 minutes later,
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:51.100]   I have a fresh hot pot, freshly ground electric port drip
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.020]   into a thermos.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.740]   And that keeps me going for like four or five hours.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.740]   So that's Monday to Friday.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.700]   On the weekends, I will grind up some beans
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.660]   and I love a good French press.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:08.660]   And then last year, I got the biggest, baddest,
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.840]   programmable cappuccino maker, also from Breville.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.940]   That was an insane amount of money,
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.900]   but I had these points that were about to expire.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:22.060]   And so I used that to order the coffee maker.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:27.060]   So I know emotionally that I should not be taking points,
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:29.180]   credit card points and points.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.720]   Intellectually, I understand that all money is fungible
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.380]   and I should really be taking it in cash.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.100]   But I do like taking in points
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:39.060]   'cause it allows me to make these very irrational
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.700]   spending decisions and not feel bad about it.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:44.660]   It was free, we paid for it with points.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.700]   Part of my brain knows that that's completely wrong.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.420]   And the other part of my brain is just like,
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:52.220]   "Dude, just shut up and enjoy the cappuccino."
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.300]   - Well, Barry, it's been wonderful
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.860]   having you on Bogleheads Uninvesting.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.540]   You've talked about a lot of things here.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.860]   You gave us your opinion about how you would do things
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.060]   and that's all important for us to hear.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.360]   I wanna thank you on behalf of the Bogleheads
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.580]   and I hope you have a great weekend.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.740]   - Oh, thanks so much, Rick.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.340]   As always, a lot of fun.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.900]   Let me know the next time you're in town,
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.420]   we'll grab another meal.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.620]   - Sounds great, thank you, Barry.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.620]   - This concludes Bogleheads Uninvesting, episode number 39.
