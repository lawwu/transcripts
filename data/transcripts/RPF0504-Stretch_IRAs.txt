[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.360]   Had a question come up to me last week that I thought would be fun for me to tackle as
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.100]   the topic of today's show because it brings together a little bit of technical financial
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.080]   planning with some discussion of various scenarios and gives me a chance with a real world example
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.000]   to talk through a few strategies that I want you to be aware of.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.040]   Listener asks this, "I want to make sure that I'm not losing my mind.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.580]   I know somebody who is 72 years old who has a traditional IRA who is thinking of converting
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.920]   some of that IRA to a Roth IRA.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.120]   They call their advisor at Merrill Lynch today and he told them they would only pay taxes
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.020]   on the contributions and that the gains would roll over into a Roth IRA tax free.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.800]   This seems to me to be incorrect advice.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.660]   Everything rolled over to the Roth, contributions and gains would be taxable as income.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.320]   Any rollover amount would have to be above and beyond the required minimum distributions
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560]   and then obviously any new gains would come out tax free.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.560]   Is that right?
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.020]   I think this guy was a certified financial planner."
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.740]   So the scenario here to make it a little bit simpler is that you have a 72 year old person
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.260]   with a traditional IRA who is trying to figure out what are the rules of converting some
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.980]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.260]   Now let's start with why somebody would want or not want to do such a conversion.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.720]   When you have a traditional IRA and that IRA could be accumulated either from a rollover
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.700]   from some sort of qualified pension plan such as a 401k or a 403b plan or it could simply
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.580]   have been accumulated over time with systematic yearly contributions.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.780]   But when you have a traditional IRA, one of the things that happens is about the age of
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.100]   70 you start to have what are called required minimum distributions.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.780]   Remember how the money gets into an IRA in the first place.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.180]   The money gets in before taxes are paid.
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.080]   The US federal government wants to have taxes paid and so you have a choice.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.740]   You can either pay them now or pay them later.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.740]   But you've got to pay them.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.500]   Just remember, the government's going to get paid, pay now or pay later.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.300]   Well a traditional IRA concept allows you to pay your taxes later.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.060]   When you earn a dollar, you don't pay income taxes on that earning.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.220]   You just slide it right into the IRA and then it can accumulate over time and the tax is
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.440]   deferred until you take it out.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.200]   Of course, the government wants to make sure they get their tax money and so they allow
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.220]   you to keep the money in there until about the age of 70 and at the age of about 70 then
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.920]   they say, "Okay, you've got to start taking money out of the account whether you need
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.960]   it or not."
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.860]   Many people are quite anxious to tap the funds in their retirement accounts but there are
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.540]   also many retirees who don't really need the money.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.460]   There could be various reasons for this.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.140]   Frequently, perhaps a retiree has their house paid off and so their outlay of cash is lower,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.660]   especially in those early years of retirement when medical expenses are also lower.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.100]   Or perhaps their social security benefit ended up being higher than they thought or they
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.920]   may have other supplementary forms of pension income and they don't actually need the money
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   from the traditional IRA.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.320]   And so this type of moderately wealthy to fairly wealthy retiree often finds it a little
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.220]   bit annoying to have to start adding extra income to their tax return every year.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.920]   And at the age of about 70, then they have to start taking those distributions.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.220]   Now there are a few ways to take those distributions out but the way that you should just think
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.900]   about required minimum distributions is simply there is a table that goes based upon the
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.380]   life expectancy and a percentage of somebody's life expectancy, a percentage of the years
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.660]   that they have remaining, however many years that is, that's what characterizes how the
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660]   money comes out.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.940]   So some small percentage of the money is going to come out each and every year.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.100]   And that's when the taxes are going to be picked up.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.640]   So that's how a traditional IRA works.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.780]   Now in this case, this particular person is thinking about converting money into a Roth
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780]   IRA.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.340]   So why would somebody want to have a Roth IRA?
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.180]   Well, the major benefit, there are a few major benefits of a Roth IRA.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.540]   First let me explain how it works and I'll talk about the benefit of a Roth IRA, specifically
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.580]   focused on retirement.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.420]   Remember the government's going to get paid now or get paid later.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.620]   In a Roth IRA, what you do is you pay the government their taxes first so that you don't
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.540]   have to pay them later.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.180]   So during your working years, you earn a dollar and you pay your tax rate on that dollar when
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.180]   you earn it.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.860]   Let's say you paid 20 cents out of your dollar in taxes and you contribute 80 cents into
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.220]   the Roth IRA.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.640]   The benefit of that, of course, is as that money grows, there are no year by year taxes.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.140]   And as long as you take that money out after the age of about 60 years old, then you can
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.400]   take it out tax free and all of the money comes out tax free.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.480]   Now notice for a moment that there's not really any difference in taxes.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.740]   You might think that a Roth IRA actually allows you to pay less money in taxes than a traditional
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.020]   IRA.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.420]   But if your tax bracket is the same during your working years as it is during your retirement
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.820]   years, that's not actually the case.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.780]   You're going to pay the same amount in dollars or the same amount in percentage in taxes
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.940]   whether you put the money in a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.820]   Frequently, people think that a Roth is better because of that reason.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.020]   It's not true.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.300]   Again, for the sake of let's do a little bit of math, if you put the money in and you deposit
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.580]   80 cents and then you fast forward say 30, 40 years over the investing timeline and then
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.820]   you calculate how much money you get out after taxes whether you paid them up front or in
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.180]   the back end, as long as you're in the same tax bracket, you'll pay the same amount in
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.620]   taxes, which is why when you're choosing between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, the number
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.180]   one factor you want to consider is usually, well, when am I going to pay money in a lower
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.420]   tax bracket?
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.740]   Is it likely that I'm going to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement because my income
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.820]   is going to be higher or lower?
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.660]   And then choose accordingly.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.080]   However, that's not the whole story.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.660]   One of the benefits of a Roth IRA is there are no required minimum distributions during
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.260]   the lifetime of the account holder.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:00.580]   So you can reach the age of 70 or 71 or 72 or 80 or 90 and you can continue to keep those
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.060]   assets in the Roth IRA.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.540]   You don't have to force them out of the Roth IRA into the world of taxes.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.900]   For somebody who has other forms of income, this can be a very valuable benefit, especially
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.980]   if they have substantial amounts of money in the Roth IRA.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.900]   The longer you can defer taxes, the better.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.980]   And this can be a really powerful tax planning tool, which is why it's reasonable for people
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:37.500]   to consider converting some of their traditional IRA assets into Roth IRA assets.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.300]   And it's wise to do that before you have required minimum distributions because you can keep
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.540]   the money in the IRA longer, which allows it to grow more and to ultimately be worth
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.900]   more.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.720]   The longer you can keep the grubby little hands of the government goons who collect
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.640]   the taxes off of your money, the more you'll have.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.100]   Just like with fees, the fewer fees you can have on money, all things else being equal,
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.100]   you'll have more money.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.580]   And so tax efficiency is very important, very important when it comes to financial planning.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.460]   Now back to the original question.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.860]   This particular client thought that they had been told by their financial planner that
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.340]   they could convert the money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA and that they would only
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.460]   pay taxes on the contributions of the account, that the gains would just roll over into the
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.240]   Roth IRA tax free.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.180]   Now of course that is erroneous.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.140]   Now my guess is not that the CFP probably gave this particular person the right advice,
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:43.060]   but the individual client of the CFP probably just misheard and misunderstood.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.060]   It's certainly possible that financial planners give bad advice.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.300]   I've given my share of wrong advice.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.340]   The rules and regulations change.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.340]   Things are very complex.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.640]   It's hard to keep it all straight.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.780]   Sometimes you just don't keep your head.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.060]   It just doesn't work.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.660]   So I've given my share of wrong advice and I think many of us would admit that we've
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.660]   done that.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.940]   But more frequently it's that somebody who's not a professional hears what they think they
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:12.300]   hear and the professional said the right words but it didn't really connect with the meaning.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:19.340]   So let's talk about how a conversion would work before age 72 and after age 72.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.940]   Now pretend that you are say 40 years old.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.460]   So we don't have any dates.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.060]   We're not worried about the 59.5 numbers.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.740]   We're not worried about that 70.5 number or that about 60 and about 70.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.500]   We've just got these – you're a 40-year-old person and we're trying to figure out whether
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.820]   you should convert some of your money over.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.460]   Now because you've put money into a traditional IRA, let's say you have $100,000 in your account,
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:47.380]   you have the option now with no income limits to convert any amount of it from traditional
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.740]   assets to Roth assets.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:56.860]   And when you do that conversion, basically what it means is you pick up some income.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.860]   Now that example would be if you were going to convert $50,000 from your traditional IRA
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.180]   to your Roth IRA, you could move it over in the accounting with the brokerage firm that
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:13.980]   you have it and then your tax return this year would have an additional $50,000 of income
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.620]   on it that you would pay taxes on.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.060]   Why would somebody do it versus why would they not do that?
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.700]   Big reason to do it is to be able to move the asset into the Roth and to get some of
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.700]   the benefits of the Roth, the longer-term growth, the fewer – no required minimum
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.700]   distributions, which has some options in a moment that I'll talk about.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.100]   The big disadvantage of course is that you're going to go ahead and pay taxes.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.500]   And so this would only be intelligent for you to do if you felt that your paying taxes
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   today was on a lower amount of income than paying taxes in the future.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.020]   You're paying at a lower rate.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.060]   So you want to be very careful in when you do this because it's silly to pay more money
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.020]   in taxes just to put the money into a Roth.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:05.900]   However, this is a way that many people can use to get large amounts of money into a Roth.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.280]   See, the rules for contributing to a Roth IRA have everything to do with how much money
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.820]   you're earning and high-income earners aren't able to contribute.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.220]   As I record this in 2017, the rule is that if you are single or head of household or
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.620]   married filing separately and you're earning more than $118,000 as your modified adjusted
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:36.660]   gross income, then you cannot contribute – you can't – excuse me, $133,000.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.460]   See, what I talked about with making mistakes.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:48.240]   If your income is over $133,000 in 2017, you can't contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.500]   If you are married filing jointly and your household income, your modified adjusted gross
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.920]   income is over $196,000, then you can't contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.020]   So if your income is, either whether you're single or married, over $200,000, you can't
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.500]   contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.620]   But you might like to have money in those Roth amounts.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:16.500]   Well, because of the ability to do a conversion, you can take money from your 401(k) or an
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.860]   IRA or traditional IRA, any kind of – you can take money from an IRA, which – the
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.340]   source of which could have been a 401(k) or a 403(b) or it could have just been accumulated
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.380]   little by little over time, and you can convert that into a Roth.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.540]   And so if you have a high household income in excess of, say, $200,000, this would be
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.620]   the way that you would get money into a Roth IRA, which can be very helpful for the reasons
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.020]   that I described.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.280]   Now, you have to pay taxes on the full amount.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.140]   You don't get to just roll the contributions in and have the gains flow in without taxes.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.220]   No, you pay taxes on the full amount.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.740]   So if you're converting $50,000 of a $100,000 account over, then you're going to pay taxes
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.580]   on the full $50,000.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:08.140]   But the question is this, what happens if you are 72 years old and now you're subject
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.060]   to required minimum distributions?
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:18.700]   Well, if the IRA is requiring you to do required minimum distributions, the answer is it depends.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.180]   Assume for a moment that our 72-year-old is earning income.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.500]   Well, in this case, it's fairly simple.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.620]   Why is this important?
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:36.100]   Because in order for you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you have to be earning wages.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.760]   You have to be earning wages.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.380]   The amount of the wages matters, depending on your filing status, single versus married,
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.380]   but you have to be earning wages.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:53.660]   So if our 72-year-old retiree still has some wages, maybe they're working part-time somewhere
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.460]   or they have a business out of which they take some wages.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.180]   Notice I'm saying wages, not profits.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.180]   There's a distinction.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.180]   Wages.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.700]   If they're earning some wages from somewhere, then they could contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.980]   Here's how that would work.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.020]   Example.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   If somebody is earning income, they have the opportunity to make contributions to the retirement
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.060]   accounts depending on their age.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:23.700]   Generally, if somebody is under the age of 50, then that number is limited at $5,500
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.740]   in 2017 for their annual contribution to a retirement account.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.780]   If they're older than 50, they have a special $1,000 catch-up contribution.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:40.940]   So our 72-year-old could contribute $6,500 into a retirement account or specifically
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.780]   into a Roth retirement account.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:50.860]   After the age of 70 and a half, you can no longer make any regular contributions to a
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.380]   traditional IRA.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.660]   So you can't make regular contributions to a traditional IRA after the age of 70 and
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.260]   a half, but you can still contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:09.380]   So the simplest scenario for our retiree, our 72-year-old retiree, is if they have some
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:15.580]   wages to just simply go ahead and make a contribution to the Roth IRA.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.660]   Assume for a moment that our 72-year-old is married, filing jointly, and our 72-year-old
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.500]   has at least $13,000 of wages.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.860]   Well, in this case, they could make a $6,500 contribution to Roth IRA for the husband and
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:35.500]   $6,500 contribution for Roth IRA to the wife, totaling $13,000.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.760]   If their required minimum distributions from the traditional IRA were $13,000, then this
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.260]   would work very, very well.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:48.160]   They had a $13,000 required minimum distribution from the traditional IRA.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.300]   That means they're going to receive $13,000 of income from the traditional IRA.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.420]   They're going to record that $13,000 of income on their tax return and pay taxes on it, but
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.700]   then they're going to make a separate $13,000 contribution to a Roth IRA, and now they're
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.540]   funding the Roth IRA.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.980]   Now, why would they want to do that?
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.340]   We'll talk in a moment that the most powerful reason is so that they can start to build
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.340]   a stretch IRA.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.980]   But for right now, recognize that this allows them to buy more tax deferral on these Roth
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.900]   IRA contributions.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.140]   And this can be helpful because they can put the money in at 72 and 73 and continue putting
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.740]   in, and they never have to take the money out of the Roth IRA.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:38.700]   The trick here is that they have to have wages, and if they don't have wages, then they can't
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.700]   make that contribution to the Roth IRA.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:49.460]   In order to contribute money to a Roth IRA, you have to have wages and then fit in under
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.340]   the earning amounts.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:58.580]   Now what I found out in the discussion over this question was that this particular retiree
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.460]   that had our questions here, this particular retiree doesn't have any wages, and so that
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.500]   messes up this plan.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.660]   Basically what it means is there's not going to be a tax-efficient way for them to move
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:16.540]   the money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:21.620]   They can't make contributions to a Roth IRA if they don't have an appropriate level of
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.340]   wages, and that's the problem here.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.980]   Now what could they do in order to get the money into a Roth IRA?
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.260]   Well they can't do anything with their required minimum distributions.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.660]   They have to take the required minimum distributions out and pay the tax on them now.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:43.380]   They could convert money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, but that's now going
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.940]   to be a separate calculation from the required minimum distributions.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.260]   They would have to go ahead and pay the tax on the required minimum distributions and
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:59.020]   then separately make a conversion of the traditional IRA assets into the Roth IRA assets and pay
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.580]   the tax on that.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.540]   And now we start to pick up a significant amount of tax.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.460]   Is that in their best interest to do?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.580]   Well it's hard to say.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.420]   Probably not from a tax perspective.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.420]   Probably not.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.860]   And the reason would be because you're picking up the income, and the whole goal is we're
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.060]   trying to keep the money in the account for tax efficiency, but now you're picking up
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.820]   more income quickly and you're just paying a whole bunch of tax now instead of stretching
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.500]   the tax efficiency out for the future.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.120]   So there's not really any easy solution or tax efficient way for them to get the money
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.660]   into a Roth IRA.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.420]   Now you would have to sit down and think about your plans.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.620]   And let me talk about the inheritance of the IRAs here and what's so powerful about having
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.700]   an IRA as an asset.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:50.300]   IRA assets and Roth IRA assets are wonderful assets to have into old age, into retirement,
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   and at death.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.940]   They're really wonderful assets to own.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:00.580]   Some of the benefits of Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs is they're very protected money from
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.380]   the claims of creditors, which is very valuable.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.540]   They are assets that you can own excellent investments in.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.060]   They're very inexpensive to own.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.700]   You can hold an IRA just about anywhere without – it's a lot cheaper than say managing
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.100]   a trust that's going to hold assets.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.980]   So they're very, very inexpensive.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.620]   And these assets are nonprobate assets.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:28.500]   So they're assets that you can adjust the beneficiaries of in a very easy and flexible
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   way.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.660]   You don't have to go and update your will when you want to change the beneficiary of
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.660]   the asset.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.420]   You can just simply change it at the website.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.380]   If you have a million dollars in an IRA or $100,000 in an IRA and you want to leave it
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.200]   to the grandkids, just tell the grandkids, "Listen, I change the IRA beneficiary every
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   single day."
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.460]   Right online, I change the beneficiary.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.620]   So whoever calls me the most and whoever I like the most, that's who I put that day
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.700]   or some version of that joke.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.820]   The point is it's very simple and easy for you to change the beneficiary of the IRA asset.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.420]   You don't have to go and file new paperwork with an attorney and update your will, get
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.500]   it notarized and signed.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.060]   You just sign a few papers.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.020]   So an IRA is a very flexible asset.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.240]   So is a Roth IRA, same thing, very flexible assets.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.680]   They have beneficiary designations.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:20.040]   One of the benefits though of an IRA and a Roth IRA is they can be inherited by people
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.580]   and your, what do they call it, inheritees, the person that inherits the account has the
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.580]   ability to also continue with some of the tax benefits.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.980]   And this is what we call colloquially a stretch IRA.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.580]   Now there's no such thing legally as a so-called stretch IRA.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:46.120]   What a stretch IRA is, it's just a word that we use to describe the rule of or describe
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.040]   the practice of trying to defer contributions, sorry, trying to defer distributions from
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:21:00.860]   the account to a future time so that we can continue to maintain the tax efficiency.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:09.060]   So let's say that I am an 80-year-old person and I have a 40-year-old child.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.380]   Well my 40-year-old child, if I leave them as the beneficiary of my IRA, they can take
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.140]   that, they can receive that IRA and of course they can take the money out right away.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.980]   But let's say it's a traditional IRA.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.740]   Well in that case they're going to take the money out and they're going to pay the taxes.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.620]   If it's a Roth IRA, they're going to take the money out and the money's going to come
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.620]   to them income tax free.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.460]   That's very valuable.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.020]   But what if they don't need the money?
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:41.740]   Well under the IRS rules, they can take the money out over a much longer schedule.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:47.140]   There are required minimum distributions for somebody who inherits an IRA account.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:53.100]   If my 40-year-old child inherits my IRA, they're going to be required to take distributions
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.300]   from that account, whether it's a Roth IRA or whether it's a traditional IRA.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.580]   And they're going to be required to take it out whether they need it or not.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.740]   The government doesn't allow the assets to stay in the IRA into perpetuity.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:12.140]   But they can take it out using a chart, a calculation chart that goes over their life
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.140]   expectancy.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.420]   They use what the IRS calls their single life expectancy table, which means that if somebody
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:24.260]   is very young, they possibly have many years at which they can keep the money in the account
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.260]   and only take out small amounts.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:32.140]   This allows an IRA or a Roth IRA to accumulate over time more and more and more while still
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.940]   staying free of taxes.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.500]   Really valuable.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.900]   The challenge of course is winding up at death with assets in the account.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.460]   And this is where a Roth IRA really shines.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.660]   Remember that at the age of 70 and a half, about 70, you're going to be taking distributions
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.420]   from a traditional IRA every year of your life.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.460]   Now if you die early, great, you get to leave behind a big IRA.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.900]   But if you die late, you're going to have taken a lot of money out of the account whether
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.060]   you need it or not.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.840]   Not so with a Roth IRA.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.140]   With that Roth IRA, you can keep the money in there.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.860]   And in fact, if you have wages, as long as you have wages, you can continue making contributions
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.300]   to the account.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.100]   So if you're working into your old age, like I recommend at 70 and 75 and 80 and 85 and
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.300]   90 and 95, and you're still working and earning wages as you probably should be and probably
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.100]   will want to be, in that situation you can still fund that Roth IRA and you never have
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.540]   to take the money out.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.060]   You die at age 100, you can leave that behind to your spouse or you can leave that behind
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.060]   to your children.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.340]   Or you could leave it behind to your grandchildren.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:49.820]   Now you just imagine for a moment, if you had a nice, fat Roth IRA at retirement age,
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:55.700]   and whether you could contribute or not, you just left it alone and it continued growing
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:02.380]   for 30 years from 60 to 90 or from 65 to 95 or 70 to 100.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.740]   Let me give you an idea of the numbers that would be involved.
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.780]   Let's say that you had a $500,000 – that would be a lot.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.940]   Let's say we had a $100,000 Roth IRA at the age of 60.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.180]   So let's put this in.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.540]   Hold on, clear the register.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.780]   This as our present value starting at the age of 60.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:29.300]   Okay, you got 35 years from 60 to 95.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.220]   Life expectancies are going up, you're a healthy person, rich people live longer.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.860]   You got 35 years.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:41.020]   Let's say that you keep that money invested in equities and you are able to earn a 9%
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.060]   investment return and you don't put any more money into it.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.660]   After 35 years, your $100,000 IRA – there must be a problem.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   Hold on.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.660]   That can't be right.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.180]   $100,000, present value.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:03.500]   35 years, 9% rate of return, no payments.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.820]   Future value after 35 years, $2 million.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.460]   $2 million in that Roth IRA.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.460]   Is that right?
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.540]   Can that be right?
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.620]   Make sure I don't mess everything up when I'm doing live math.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.060]   Let's see here.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.780]   $2 million.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.860]   I've got to check myself.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.460]   I have to work it backwards and make sure I didn't mess anything up.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.060]   35 years, annualized interest.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.540]   Yeah, I'm right.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:41.540]   $100,000 at the age of 60 invested for 35 years at 9% interest equals $2 million in
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.340]   a Roth IRA at the age of 100.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.820]   I just felt really high and I don't think I'm making a dumb error somewhere.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.700]   Talk about a dumb error, I'll tell on myself.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:58.660]   I gave a recent speech and at that recent speech, I was talking about percentages.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:05.100]   I did the math and I forgot to change my final decimals to percentages in my presentation.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:13.980]   I put the numbers in and I said that 0.24% of an audience does such and such or 0.57%
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.980]   does such and such.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.900]   Then I went back and afterwards, somebody said, "Didn't you mean you forgot to multiply
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.900]   by 100?"
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.340]   I had completely messed up my numbers in my presentation.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.900]   It's recorded on video, very embarrassing.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.060]   We all make math mistakes.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:35.660]   Just imagine this Roth IRA that's left alone and this Roth IRA grows over time.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.100]   You leave that as an asset to your grandchild.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:45.380]   Let me give you an idea here of how much money that could be.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:51.540]   If you die and leave your $2 million at your death, you leave your $2 million Roth IRA
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.300]   asset to your 20-year-old grandchild, your 20-year-old grandchild would have to start
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.340]   taking out required minimum distributions.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.860]   But it's not all that much.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.660]   If we did the math real quick on the single life expectancy for a beneficiary who's 20
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.260]   years old, their life expectancy would be 63 years.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.860]   The way it would work is they would take the $2 million balance of the account and you
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.940]   would divide that in by 63 and you would get your required minimum distribution in the
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.340]   first year is $31,746.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.340]   Your grandchild would receive that money income tax-free.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:33.200]   Remember it's a Roth IRA asset and so that money would come to them income tax-free.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.340]   You put $100,000 into the account, you left it alone, it was never taxed, you leave it,
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.260]   your grandchild starts to receive that money income tax-free.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.780]   Then they would have basically 63 years over the course of their life expectancy during
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.380]   which they could take distributions.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.740]   Now there would be a bit of a scale here that I can't do for you live to show you exactly
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:01.160]   how much of an amount this would be just based upon required minimum distributions.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:06.100]   But let's just talk about what it would be, how much your annual payments would be if
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.000]   we were going to take level payments and deplete the account over time.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.100]   So let's say that our 20-year-old, our goal is to take payments out over 63 years of their
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.880]   life expectancy which takes them to 83.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.920]   So we've got a $2 million, clear the register, $2 million starting balance.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.220]   So that's our present value.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.700]   Our starting balance for them is $2 million.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:33.220]   We've got a 63-year time horizon in which we're going to take distributions.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:38.060]   We're going to keep it at that 9% investment interest rate or that investment return, 9%
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.060]   investment return.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.940]   We're assuming you keep the money well invested at equities and we're able to earn 9% net
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.940]   of fees.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.300]   We don't have to worry about taxes here, net of fees.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:51.060]   And our closing value, our future value is going to be zero on this account.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.860]   What would be the payments out of this account?
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:29:00.380]   Well, in that situation, if we were able to earn that amount of income, hold on, that
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.380]   cannot be right.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.380]   Man, I double-checked it again and it works.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.780]   Man, I just double-checked it again.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.540]   I get so scared when I say these numbers because they sound unbelievable and yet they are technically
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.780]   accurate under the assumptions that I said.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:21.740]   Old grandchild taking money out over 63 years, if they just took out a level payment over
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:29.300]   63 years, starting with $2 million, earning 9% annually on the money, that would be an
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:34.900]   annual flow into their pocket of $180,793.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.100]   $180,793.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.740]   I checked it three times.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.020]   That's the power of assets sheltered from tax.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:52.700]   Now, go ahead and get your financial calculator and you run any scenario that you want.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:59.000]   But when you're talking about a very, very simple and powerful way to leave money behind
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.660]   for heirs, Roth IRA is a wonderful way to do that.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.020]   And remember those required minimum distributions, they're adjusted based upon the value of the
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.820]   account at the end of the year, which means that when the account value goes down, then
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.500]   they naturally wind up taking less.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.060]   When the account value goes up, they take out more.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.540]   And that money's coming in tax-free.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.780]   So just imagine yourself.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:26.620]   You at 60 years old accumulate $100,000 in a Roth IRA.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.420]   You leave it alone for 35 years until you die.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:37.980]   And then your grandchild inherits it and takes it out over the course of a little over 60
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.580]   years.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:46.900]   If that money can be intelligently invested, we're talking huge amounts of money received
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.900]   income tax-free.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.060]   Now, is this a perfect solution for all scenarios?
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.780]   No, of course not.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.620]   One of the disadvantages, for example, with just doing this in a simple Roth IRA is you
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.940]   have no control over the money.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.460]   You can't force your 20-year-old grandchild to not take all the money out in the first
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.620]   year and go and buy a bunch of fun stuff.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.580]   You can't force them to—you can't exert control over it.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.100]   You would have to write a trust and leave this as an asset of the trust, which has its
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.180]   own benefits and disadvantages in it.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.760]   But this is simple.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.200]   This is easy.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.180]   And it continues to get huge benefits for your grandchild.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:32.260]   For example, one of the things that people would want—that people want with their children
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.700]   and their grandchildren, they want asset protection.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.900]   Roth IRA, basically ironclad, governed by state law, but basically most states have
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.500]   put in place protections for it, protections from the claim of creditors.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.500]   Now, the big concern is what about in the case of divorce?
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.660]   Well, an IRA asset that is received as a gift from a grandfather, whether you're in a community
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.580]   property state or a non-community property state, is generally considered to be individual
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.580]   property.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.460]   It's not generally considered to be a marital asset.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.340]   It's protected.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.700]   So there are tremendous benefits to this, and it's simple.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.820]   You can open a Roth IRA with just about anybody.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.620]   So I hope these ideas give you an idea of how valuable a Roth IRA is.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:18.060]   Of course, you're subject to potential danger of changing tax laws.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.740]   Can the IRS and can the U.S. federal government change their tax laws?
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   Absolutely.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.740]   Will they?
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.740]   Absolutely.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.740]   What will they change it to?
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   Who knows?
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740]   I don't know.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:35.180]   But it's a powerful, powerful, simple tool.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.860]   Now back to the original question.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:45.620]   Unfortunately, for this retiree, they can't really efficiently get the money from their
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.660]   traditional IRA into a Roth IRA because they don't have wages.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.580]   They don't have wages.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.860]   They can't do a Roth.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:58.780]   Yes, they could convert it, and that's worth considering for the reasons that I described.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.100]   But they should acknowledge the fact that it's not necessarily tax-efficient to do that.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.940]   It may be useful, but it's not necessarily tax-efficient.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.660]   What I would do if I woke up or if I were giving advice to this particular 72-year-old
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:15.220]   person, I wouldn't recommend that they convert the money necessarily.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:20.060]   What I would probably do is I would have them just take those required minimum distributions,
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.820]   and if they're going to go for the kids or for the grandkids, just write checks to the
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:28.580]   kids or the grandkids, or figure out a way to make sure the kids and the grandkids get
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:35.740]   income, have their own wages, and then go ahead and make a Roth IRA contribution for
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.940]   them.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:43.340]   If this 72-year-old has a 10-year-old grandchild, and if that 10-year-old grandchild can earn
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:52.940]   $5,000 of wages, the grandparent here can make a gift to the grandchild of $5,000, and
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:34:01.180]   the grandchild can make a $5,000 contribution to their Roth IRA while also having $5,000
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.020]   that they can spend.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.780]   Because they earned $5,000 and they received $5,000 from the grandparent, $5,000 of that
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:13.740]   total of 10 is in the Roth IRA, and then $5,000 is spendable income.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.740]   That would be very powerful.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:20.060]   Now, the grandchild, if they can leave it alone, can also have the money grow over time.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.260]   It can grow tax-protected for a very long period of time, but also the grandchild has
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.180]   the benefit, and I believe it's a benefit, of being able to withdraw the money, because
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.100]   of course with a Roth IRA, you can always withdraw your contribution to the account
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.260]   without penalty.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:39.620]   If they contributed $5,000 to the account, and the account has grown in value from $5,000
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:46.420]   to $5,500, they can always make that $5,000 withdrawal from the account.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:52.140]   So as long as the grandchild, as long as somebody can earn wages, we have opportunities.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.540]   Hope you enjoy thinking those scenarios through.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.980]   IRAs and Roth IRAs are powerful tools.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.540]   They're really, really powerful.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.700]   They're very, very useful in the hands of a competent financial planner, aka you.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.700]   I want you to use these tools and look at them and think about how they can be used
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.740]   to their maximum advantage.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.660]   And this particular benefit of a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, to be able to take the
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.660]   money out over an extended period of time, and thus protect the money from taxes, is
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.660]   valuable.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:28.500]   Remember, you have this benefit in both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, as the tax law currently
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   stands.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:34.300]   The recent tax proposal had some proposed changes, but to my knowledge, as things go
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:41.220]   at the moment, those proposals to change the stretch IRA rules are not included in the
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.980]   current debates over tax law changes.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.780]   But they both have those benefits.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.540]   It's just a lot harder to arrive at death with a nice fat IRA than it is with a nice
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.100]   fat Roth IRA.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.700]   I hope this is useful for you.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.340]   If it's not useful for you, talk with your parents.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.020]   Talk with a friend.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.140]   Try to help someone else with these ideas.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.660]   These ideas are available to the common man.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.340]   You don't have to go and spend thousands of dollars on fancy documents.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.300]   You do have to sit down and look at your situation and understand it.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.020]   And that's your job and my job, to sit down and look at our situations and look at other
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.300]   people's situations and try to help people to do smart stuff with their money.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:26.740]   If we can do that, my hope is we'll keep a lot more of it.
