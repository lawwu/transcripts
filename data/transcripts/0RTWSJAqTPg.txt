[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   The following is a conversation with Zach Bitter, ultra marathon runner and coach who held multiple
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   world records in the 100 mile run and other ultra endurance events. He is currently training for a
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.480]   run across America which for now is planned for September this year. Like many of the things
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.960]   Zach has done in the past, this is a big fascinating challenge. Quick mention of our sponsors
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.520]   Ladder, Valcampo, Noom and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.480]   As a side note, let me say that Zach has been advising and coaching me on my own
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.840]   running journey. I want to mention that Zach sent me some running shoes from Ultra which I think is
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.080]   a company that sponsors him. When I put those shoes on I feel like Zach is watching me and I get that
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.840]   extra motivation to make him proud. And by that I mean I want to put a lot of miles on those shoes.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.920]   Running is something that has always been difficult for me but I love it because it is difficult.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.680]   The hardest part is I'm left alone with my thoughts for one or two hours. Some thoughts
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.400]   are dark like thinking about mortality, my own and that of others. Some are self-critical like
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.160]   personal weaknesses or dreams not realized. Some are simply human feelings of loneliness, personal
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.120]   and existential. And yet there are the moments during a run when all that fades and I'm left
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.120]   empty of negative thoughts and full of appreciation for the beauty of experience, of nature, life,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.720]   the whole thing. This is why I return to running. Not to get in shape but to face myself and to run
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.080]   through it. That's why I'm inspired by people like Zach and by David Goggins and others like them who
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.560]   seek to find the limits of their body and mind. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here is my
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.840]   conversation with Zach Bitter. Where does your mind go when you're running an ultra marathon?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.520]   Are there a lot of positive thoughts, negative thoughts, demons, inspirational things, maybe
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   no thoughts at all? - Yeah, that's the really interesting part of the sport I think 'cause
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   you can, essentially what it is when we're looking at like the hundred mile distance or anything
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.760]   that's like all day long is you're gonna have the full range or the full spectrum of emotions,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   of mental processes, both kind of positive, negative and in between. So it almost feels like
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.560]   you've lived multiple lives or full life maybe is the way to say it in that one time period.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.440]   It's almost like a simulation of what you may experience in a long period of time in a very
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.920]   condensed period of time. And I think that's just a weird mental process to reflect upon.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.360]   And that's what kind of draws people back to it. But I mean, it's a battle too, because if you're
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.760]   looking at it from a performance standpoint versus an experience, you obviously wanna minimize the
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.040]   negative mindset stuff. You wanna try to keep those emotions and those thought processes at a
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.520]   low. And I think when you can keep yourself from letting those thoughts creep in, you end up having
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.440]   better races and it can spiral in either direction. I noticed like there's kind of like this scenario
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.840]   that occurs where in the beginning, like a negative thing creeps in your mind, it's like super easy
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.240]   just to slap it down and say like, "Get out of here. I've did the training, I'm fit, I'm feeling
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   fresh still. Everything's going well at this point in time." You get a little further along in the
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.400]   race and you're starting to feel a bit of the fatigue. I mean, a little bit of self-doubt
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320]   creeps in. You start asking yourself, "Well, maybe I should have done one more long run or
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.120]   did I not quite taper long enough?" And those things can kind of spiral into a negative way.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.080]   And if you let it keep going, it keeps going all the way to like, "Why am I here? Why am I doing
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.520]   this? This is stupid." All the way to like, "There's another one of these two weeks from now,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.640]   I'm gonna drop out of this one and sign up for that one instead." And then you just find yourself
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.880]   in the exact same situation. So, you kind of have to go through the process, I think. It's why I
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.560]   think there's kind of a – I won't say it's a rule of thumb necessarily, but something I think is
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.320]   fairly valuable is if you do a hundred mile for the first time, make sure you get it done,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.120]   even if it means like death marching is what they'll call it in the alternating community,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.920]   the end of the race. Just to say like you got that full experience, you experienced the highs,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.320]   the lows, the full thing, the starting, the crossing the finish line, that release of emotion
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.000]   when you're done and all that stuff. So that when you go back to do it again, you have like a
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.720]   template to build off of and you know – or you just have some data to pull from about how your
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.400]   mind is gonna work as well as your body so that you can start practicing, "Well, what do I have
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.920]   to do to kind of keep my mind from spiraling in a negative direction or how do I catch some
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.840]   positive momentum and kind of keep sending it that way?" And things like that. And that just,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.840]   I think, you just add to that over a career of running them or a series of running them and
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.360]   it sharpens. It's kind of like any sport with that where you always have this balance between
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.920]   the youthfulness that you may have early in your career versus the wise intelligence that you have
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.840]   maybe near the end of your career. - So in terms of wisdom, is there mechanisms by which you kind
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.360]   of observe the negative thoughts and let them go? So you have people like the David Gogginses who
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.680]   kind of, he seems to almost like separate his mind into, there's the weak David that he hates
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   and then there's the strong one. I mean, there's like a very contentious relationship there.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.720]   So he basically says like, "I refuse to be that person." And he's almost like angry at that
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.120]   person. It's almost like sometimes literally yelling at that person, the weak version of
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.320]   themselves. And then there's another more sort of Sam Harris-y approach, which is like just observe
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:01.040]   the thought and let it go. Maybe knowing that this too shall pass, like no matter what, this moment
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.440]   will not last forever and kind of sort of accepting the natural flow of things and taking one step at
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.960]   a time and allowing whatever the negativity, whatever the pain you're experiencing just to pass,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.360]   even if it means a death march. Which one is more effective for you? Which one, like would you say
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.920]   generally speaking to the population is more effective? Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.800]   It's probably unique to the individual. I wouldn't argue that David is finding success with his
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.520]   approach. Some may argue it's an extreme version. Sam has obviously thought about these things and
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.880]   really probably, I see those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum in just the way that they
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.040]   come across in general, where David's really at you, kind of high energy, and Sam's kind of this
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.920]   calming, soft presence, and he's just going to slowly, methodically lay it all out there.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.200]   And I think there's value in both of those. I think most people are probably going to get a
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.680]   benefit from pulling some from each. I mean, there's times where I need a kick in the ass,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.720]   and then it's like have the strong Zach, tell the weak Zach to get moving. But there's also times
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.960]   where it's just like a subtle voice entering my head about, "I don't know if I feel quite right
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.000]   now. Should I maybe pull back on the pace?" And I think that little subtle voice is best approached
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.240]   with a subtle positive voice where it's more like, "Okay, well, let's think this through here for a
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.960]   second. You're 40 miles into a 100-mile race. You spent four months preparing for it. You know from
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.720]   the workouts you did that you're ready for this. There really isn't any real reason for you to slow
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.360]   down or to fall off your goal or your pace or reassess what you're doing. Let's just give this
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.120]   another mile or two, and then we can reassess if we need to in order to kind of figure out if I'm
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:59.040]   doing the right things or not." And I think in that situation, you definitely probably want to
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.960]   lean more towards the Sam Harris approach with that because there's really no reason to. It's
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   almost like the same thing you see with just training and even nutrition to a degree where
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.520]   some folks, they just want to be kind of drilled. They want to be yelled at and said, "Get going.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.120]   Get doing this." And that helps and that motivates and that helps them stay accountable.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.440]   Other people need some softer love with it where it's like, "This isn't necessarily your fault.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.560]   You were put in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy and maybe poor
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.680]   nutritional choices and things like that." But it's correctable. So we need to step away from
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.520]   that and we need to kind of start heading in the direction that we know is going to bear fruit down
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.760]   the road. And that person may respond better to that. So I think both those guys have great value
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.080]   with their approaches. They're just probably polar ends of the spectrum. And I think most
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.520]   people are probably going to benefit, like anything, right? You get the polarizing ones,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   and those are going to work great for the polarizing people. But then most people are
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   going to fit somewhere in the middle. So they're probably going to be able to kind of pull from
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.400]   both of those if they're able to sit down and kind of assess which one's going to work better
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.200]   in which situation. - So the quitting thing that you mentioned,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.120]   like the final stage, which actually I get to much quicker than you seem to, which is like,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:23.120]   why am I doing this? I get there with basically anything I do. It's like, this is probably the
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.520]   stupidest thing I've ever done is the feeling I get often. And then immediately you have these
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   excuses that are like, there's all these other better things you should be doing.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.960]   Or the other alternative of that, like you said, I'm not prepared enough for this moment. I'll be
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.800]   much more prepared in two weeks for the next event. So like, why? Let's try this again. Let's
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:52.880]   start over. Let's start over in two weeks. How do you deal with that quit? Like, so maybe do you
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.520]   still go through that process and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.280]   me, how to deal with that quitting voice? - I think a lot of times when the quitting voice
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:13.120]   kind of comes in, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage,
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.520]   I guess, in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you're looking at like
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.840]   what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're feeling in the moment versus how
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.080]   are you feeling about the whole process? So one thing that I started doing in 2019,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:38.160]   and I don't think it's necessarily, I think this was a big reason why I had one of my best racing
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.320]   seasons in 2019 that I'd had to that date. It was part of it was I started, I think,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.040]   putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus putting emphasis on like,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:56.320]   this is one opportunity or one day of work and this is one emotional kind of flare up.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.120]   But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture? So when I decide to do a race
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.000]   or an event or something like that, it's often four or six months out ahead of time,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.640]   you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're going
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.240]   through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day and all
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.920]   that stuff. And then you get to the race itself or the event itself. And it's very easy to look at
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.600]   that and think that's an isolation. Like I'm going to run 12 hours today or I'm going to run 100
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:34.160]   miles today or whatever it ends up being. And it's a lot easier to quit when you think to yourself,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.360]   I'm 40 miles into 100 mile race. That's just a 40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.040]   people. But in perspective, and we're talking about the ultra marathon running community,
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.440]   it's a lot easier just to say like, well, I'll scrap this 40 miles and try again.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   It's a lot harder to say, I'm going to scrap the entire last four months, the entire reason why I
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.720]   was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there. So I think I just try to reposition it of like,
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.960]   I'm in a bad place right now, maybe in my head or I'm hitting a low point here,
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:11.280]   but I'm 99% of the way towards the goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.400]   leading up to that. So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because I mean, there are times
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   when you're doing something and you ask yourself why and you don't have a good reason. And then
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.440]   maybe it is advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.000]   actually want to invest time and energy into? Because someone like yourself who is very much
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.320]   into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get... I mean,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.160]   I'm a very curious person. So there's like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn't
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.440]   doing what I'm doing. And I know I would enjoy all of them. So at a certain point though, you
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.600]   have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me? And if the answer keeps
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that hundred things
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.640]   that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason. Then I just need
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.200]   to identify some of those things. Like, well, why did this one take the top spot out of the
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.080]   hundred things that I could have picked from? And keeping like a list of those in your head,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.640]   so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this? Why am I here?
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.840]   that before I started this. And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.800]   early, middle or late. And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.520]   had a little more of a level head. - Well, there's something about the thing
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:38.240]   you mentioned when you mentioned the death march. It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:46.800]   Like in the moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if it, you do go through
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.480]   the process and realize that it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.840]   life. Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.560]   that escape clause from other things in your life. So I've quit on a few things in my life. And I
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:14.160]   think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door. It's almost like a muscle.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.800]   I don't know. So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.440]   You know what I mean? Like, like I'm really good at coming up with reasons to quit.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.120]   My mind is really good at that. And I, it feels like I have to come up with,
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.840]   like really work hard to make sure that there's no quit, that I never allow myself to quit,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.320]   no matter how stupid the thing I'm doing is. I don't know if any of that makes sense, but
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:52.400]   it just, maybe to rephrase this whole thing, do you think it's good to live life by the ethos of
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.640]   never quit? - Yeah, that's a really interesting thing.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.920]   And I think it actually resonates with a lot of ultra marathon runners, because there seems to be
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.640]   a trend when you have someone who's been in the sport for a long time, where there's a point where
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.720]   they start the sport, right? And they're like super excited about everything. Everything's new.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.280]   It's very easy not to quit. Cause you're like, oh, this is the first time I've ever run a 50
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.560]   Ks. The first time I've ever run a 50 miles. The first time I've ever run a hundred Ks. The first
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.920]   time I've ever run a hundred miles and so on and so forth. And when you're doing that for the first
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.800]   time, I think there's a heightened motivation to not quit. Cause you don't want your first
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:38.400]   attempt to be a failure. And then you get a little further along and you start reflecting on the
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.320]   landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find yourself quitting on an event.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:50.080]   And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once, now all of a sudden, like you
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.680]   described perfectly, that quit pops up in your head maybe a little sooner the next time. Or
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.440]   maybe a little bit before. And I've certainly had these experiences in my career as well. And
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   what happens I think if you stick with it, again, I think it is important to assess whether you
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.800]   really want to be doing what you're doing. But if you start recognizing that about yourself in a
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.320]   certain activity where it's like, I think I might be pulling the plug early on some of this stuff.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.080]   I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just, at that point,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.720]   you need to make a decision. Do I want to keep doing this? If the answer is yes,
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.840]   you hold yourself accountable to not quitting. And eventually what will happen is you'll find
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.600]   yourself in a position where, I'll use ultra marathons for example, where you're just clicking
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.120]   on all cylinders for that day. And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.920]   You have these low points. But for whatever reason, when those low points come, you're able
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.840]   to push through them better than you would have in the past. And then you push through maybe two or
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.760]   three more than you did after you had quit the time before. Then it's accountability time, right?
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.880]   Because then you have to look back at that and say, well, why did this time was I able to be
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:04.240]   mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra opportunities to quit when I wasn't
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   before? And it can be easy to look back and say and live kind of like retroactively in the sense
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.040]   where you're like regretting, well, why did I drop out of those races? Why did I do this wrong there
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.520]   and that? And I just think that's where you have to kind of catch yourself and say, no, those things
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.760]   happened to me in order to put me in a position where I decided, well, this time I'm not going
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.320]   to quit no matter what, minus my leg falling off. I'm not going to quit. And then you put yourself
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.760]   in a position to have that day where you push through more times than you ever have before.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.840]   And you just redefine what you're capable of. And then once I think you do that, you start looking
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:45.120]   at those earlier lessons as lessons. Were they failures on paper at the time? Probably. But
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.000]   can you pull things from them to learn as to like, well, where is your actual threshold? Where is the
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.920]   limit actually for you? And then kind of start redefining that stuff. So I think the never quit
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:04.960]   mentality can be good in certain situations. But I don't think it's necessarily a holistic thing
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.440]   where you need to be in something where it's never quit, always do more. Because then you end up in
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.040]   a situation where you find this margin of diminishing returns, especially when it comes
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.000]   to training and workouts and things like that, where there are times where often there are times
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.840]   where you want to actually quit a little bit before you would have to, because the stress
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.120]   that was required to elicit a growth response has already occurred. And just to do more is just going
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.520]   to require more recovery time to get back and do it again. Yeah, this is the tricky tradeoff.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.560]   Living by the never quit mentality, you're not going to achieve optimal performance.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.360]   In your head, you might.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:48.960]   It seems like when you look at the full arc of human history, the people who do great things
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.800]   are more leaning towards the never quit. Like, I feel like at any one moment,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:02.400]   you're more in danger of quitting than you are being suboptimal. So like, in terms of advice,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:10.560]   it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice. Unless you deeply know the person,
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.680]   maybe this is like wrestling mentality. I've seen too many, and because I'm annoyed with the
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.560]   current culture telling me to relax and have a work life balance and all those kinds of things,
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:28.480]   which all have a deep, deep truth to them. But the reality is like, there's not enough people
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.920]   that walk up to me and like slap me and say, "Get your shit together." Like, "Don't quit.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:43.360]   Work harder." I think we need to hear that more. And I can remember that from the wrestling rooms,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:49.920]   like that when you're pushed that way, when you're forced to the very limit and you don't quit,
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:56.160]   that makes better humans. I think people need to get that in their life. I think they need to have
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.280]   situations where that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue,
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:08.480]   experience that avenue, where I think it's maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.200]   life philosophy where like every little thing you do is never quit.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.520]   But life is short, Zach. I mean, this is the problem I have. This is probably the programming
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   thing too is over-optimization is dangerous. It's like every once in a while, I mean, you're,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.440]   you do this kind of stuff. You're not, for example, with a hundred mile run. I mean,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.760]   you could just be doing that for the rest of your life and do like the most optimal hundred mile run
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:42.320]   ever, but you keep taking on like new challenges and there's a lot more chaos in that. And there,
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.880]   it feels like the muscle of never quit will be much more important than the optimality of your
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.240]   training. Yeah. So there's probably a couple sides to me with that kind of a thing where
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   for one, I think when we talked about the why, so like, I think the why can kind of shift a bit
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.560]   and it probably will if you do something long enough or evolve maybe is a better way to call,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:11.680]   let's put it. And for me, like one of my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:17.760]   running is to first of all, find an event that I really, really love to train for and participate
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   in. So for me, I feel like I've kind of identified that to a degree and that's kind of runnable
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:29.120]   hundred milers. So once I found that it became more of a driver for me to see like, well, how
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.080]   fast can I run a hundred miles in a very controlled environment? So let's eliminate weather, let's
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   eliminate, you know, elevation, let's eliminate like having to wait extra long to get crew or
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.240]   support and that sort of thing. And that's how you find yourself on a 400 meter track running
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.280]   a hundred miles. But for me, like that, the important part of that is that I can control
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:55.680]   the environment enough where if I come back year after year, I can retest myself and have a decent
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.400]   ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed or I stayed stagnant. And I think that's a big
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:07.440]   driver for me. But one thing I've recognized within that is if you just keep doing that,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:14.080]   like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred milers a year and optimally prepare,
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.160]   race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out. But one thing I think I learned
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:27.680]   also in 2019 was that sometimes you kind of need to step away from some of these really,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   really kind of important markers in your like your performance or in whatever you're trying to do and
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.400]   take a step away from it and try to do something a little different in order to kind of hit the
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:44.160]   reset button on just like what I would call just like your mental energy to be able to continue to
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.280]   do it at a high level. So- - Almost like happiness.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.520]   - Exactly. Well, and here's the example. Like, I mean, I love running in trails too. Most people
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.720]   would consider me a flat road track runner, runnable ultra runner, but I like to do trail
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:06.080]   runs too. So at the end of 2018, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.480]   to run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like,
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.360]   okay, I did one. Now I'm gonna take a brief off season, but then I'm gonna ultimately build up
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.440]   and peak for another one. I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're gonna
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.200]   be B races, they're gonna be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are gonna kind of
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.960]   mimic like a long run essentially. But the main focus, always in the back of my mind was like
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.120]   getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles. And that just kind of,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:39.200]   that energy that it takes to continually think by that, I think the motivation to keep that stope
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.400]   high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from it for a little
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:50.240]   bit. So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided I'm gonna prepare
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:57.360]   for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation, technical trail type of
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.040]   an event. Is that trail run or no? Yeah. It's a trail hundred miler actually just technically
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.360]   just outside of San Diego. And yeah, it goes through, it goes over part of the Pacific Crest
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.600]   trail and stuff. So it's very different than running on a runnable surface. So to give you
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.560]   some context, like I ran, what was it? I think just under 17 hours for that race. Whereas on a
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.800]   flat surface, I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes. So just the environment alone added an extra,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:31.200]   you know, five plus hours to the day. So it's just a different experience, different skill set.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.360]   And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like splits on a
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.960]   track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat environment and
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.600]   start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical running skill sets
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.200]   and things like that. And the cool part about it was, uh, first of all, you know, when you step
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.560]   away from something and enter something a lot different, I mean, it's still running. There's
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.800]   still a huge advantage I had from the running I'd done in the past. It was going to put me in a good
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.360]   position to be successful, but there was a much higher, uh, or a much bigger range of potential
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:13.280]   improvement for me. So through the like, you know, four plus months I spent preparing for that race,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.840]   you know, I noticed, oh wow, I'm getting faster on this climb or I'm getting better at descending
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.680]   this technical trail. It was one of the most fun races I've run actually. So it was kind of a cool
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.200]   experience. I ended up, uh, taking the lead at like 93 miles. So you were racing, racing, like
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.320]   you were trying to get first. So it's still a race. Yeah. So what was the enjoyable aspect of it?
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.960]   I don't think I recognized it so much while I was doing it. Actually it surfaced afterwards. I mean,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.160]   the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're sitting
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.800]   in basically second place all day long, and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like 91
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:51.920]   or 92 miles. It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race. Um, it, but afterwards I recognized
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.840]   a few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:04.400]   miler versus the second half. I also recognized shortly thereafter, uh, once I finished recovering
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:10.480]   and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.200]   excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.040]   And I don't think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:26.320]   miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized a
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.000]   suboptimal like a outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.360]   And I recognize that it was just every workout I did. I was like, I did this workout a year ago
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.080]   and it was not nearly this much fun or, you know, you, then the interesting thing about these track
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.160]   hundreds too, is like, you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where you're running
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.240]   your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so. And I'll do them
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.480]   on back to back days. And, you know, I try to replicate the environment that I'm going to race
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.520]   on. So I'm finding myself on a 400 meter track. And it's like, when I started doing that again,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.720]   I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those back to
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.800]   back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.120]   So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to race
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.920]   day environment that I had in quite some time. And I think that was really beneficial and kind
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.680]   of putting me in a right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day and put me in a
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.120]   position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood given the enjoyment I had in the
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.720]   months leading into the race itself. Yeah. Even the thought of quitting. Yeah.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.520]   Yeah. So you mentioned the track. You've also ran 100 miles on the treadmill
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:42.480]   and the trail 100 mile broadly. If we zoom out, what does it take to run 100 miles for most of
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.720]   the world? That seems like a crazy distance to run. So maybe it's interesting to ask,
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:55.360]   not only is just setting the world record, but purely running. What does it take to run that far?
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.360]   Yeah. I mean, I think people probably overestimate what it takes in terms of just
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.680]   getting it done. I think this is consistent in just running in general. I think the marathon
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.240]   was always a big one with that where people thought like, well, you have to do this training
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   or you just literally won't physically be able to complete a marathon. And then we got into an
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.120]   era of kind of like running as more of an enjoyment thing versus a performance thing.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.720]   And then you'd have people running, granted much slower. I think if you look at the Boston
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.040]   marathon, average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the Boston marathon. It
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   might've just been marathons in general went from like three hours to five hours or something like
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   that. So it's like people, I think, got past the fact that you can only do it if you're optimally
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.120]   prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm going to like
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.880]   not do much training, which I wouldn't necessarily advise. But I mean, I've talked to people who
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:52.080]   basically run 100 miles sometimes almost off the couch. And it's like, to me, what that says is
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.160]   just the human body's incredible and what it can tolerate above and beyond what it's been exposed
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.960]   to if it has to, or if it feels like it has to. - So that's the basic sort of getting from point
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.720]   A from the start to the finish is the human body and the human mind is capable of doing it without
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:14.160]   much preparation. But then you start to increase the goal of performance and you try to get actually
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.280]   a good, like the most out of your body that you can. How does that start to change then?
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:25.680]   Going from fun to performance. - Yeah, I think once you start putting marks or goals on outside
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.960]   of just finishing, that's where it starts getting interesting because now you can maybe go on with
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.600]   multiple goals where like if one falls off due to something that you didn't expect, then you have
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.440]   another one to target. But you can always build those up and try to think like, well, I want to
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.560]   run faster than last time or I want to break a course record or an age group record or something
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:48.720]   like that. And that I think is just going to be a little bit of a different mindset because now
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.400]   you're looking at every little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what do I need
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.040]   to do to be efficient on the day itself. So like transitioning aid stations and things like that
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:05.840]   or do I want to pace or not or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.640]   certain spot or do I have to be in specific areas to get that type of stuff. And what it ends up
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.560]   doing is it ends up bringing a lot more variables to the table. And I think it's interesting because
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.160]   there's always going to be more variables on the day than you are able to account for.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.480]   So at a certain degree, you have to kind of find yourself in a position where I'm going to make
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.440]   sure I take care of the big ones or the ones that are like obviously I need to be ready for like
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.480]   my fueling strategy, my hydration strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.840]   me in a position to physiologically have this process go as well as possible. How am I going
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.040]   to like hold myself accountable in aid station transition so I'm not like having a ton of non
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.920]   moving time versus moving time and things like that. - This is so cool. So there's these like
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.080]   big variables that you're aware of and you're trying to optimize over the space of variables.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.000]   - Yep. - So you get to start to play with that
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.440]   when you're looking for performance. - It's almost like moving from checkers to
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.800]   chass, right? You have like, or maybe even like connect forward chass or something like that,
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.160]   where it goes from just kind of like, well, one foot in front of the other. And when I get to the
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.760]   next aid station, I'll just eat whatever looks good, drink whatever, you know, quenches my thirst
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.320]   and then move on to the next one to like, well, which one of these food products is actually going
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.120]   to make me move a little faster to the next aid station or, you know, which one of these pacing
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.600]   strategies is going to get me to the finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:34.800]   So it gets more complicated, more interesting and in my opinion anyway, also there's, I mean,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.480]   but there's a breaking point with that too, because like I said, there's an endless number
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.360]   of variables you could account for. And as the distance gets longer, that list gets longer too.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.720]   So you find yourself in this position where you have to at some point say, okay, I've accounted
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.520]   for everything I can reasonably account for. Now I need to be in a mental space where when something
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.400]   happens that I wasn't able to account for, I'm able to respond to it with the right decision
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.160]   and keep going and not dwell on it. Because that's another thing, I mean, you're running slow enough
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.800]   when you're doing a hundred miles, where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.120]   on that mistake and say, why did I do that? That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah. When
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.000]   in reality, what you need to do is that happened. Everyone else out here is going to have a
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.680]   situation like that at some point. Mine happened now. I need to figure out how I can move forward
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.480]   at the fastest sustainable pace and not think about what happened back there. And that's where
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.560]   I think it gets really interesting. - What would you say it takes to set a world record in the
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.520]   hundred miler? - Well, first of all, I think you probably have to focus on that specific event.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.920]   I mean, the interesting about ultra running where it maybe deviates a bit from just other endurance
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.000]   sports is there's such a wide range. I mean, we talked about a little bit when I talked about the
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.160]   San Diego hundred versus kind of the flat runnable stuff. - Can you maybe paint a picture of what are,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.440]   there's a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events. What are like the big ones
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:03.840]   in your mind? So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon, there's 50K, what are different
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:10.240]   kinds, there's a hundred mile that in your mind, like kind of these islands where people gather
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.120]   often. - Yeah. So there's a few that really stand out. I would say the three biggest ultra
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.280]   marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a historical standpoint, but
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.960]   in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100. That's the biggest,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.400]   most competitive hundred miler. It's on the trail side of things in the United States. Then there's
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.240]   ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive hundred miler on the planet right
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.080]   now. In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail Mount
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.840]   Blanc is more competitive. I think in the most recent few years, you're just seeing a lot more
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.880]   of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:53.120]   And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon, which is technically
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:59.200]   56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon is going to generally be the most competitive
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.120]   ultra marathon. The weird thing is the distance thing, right? Because most people when they think
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.400]   of endurance sports, they're thinking about precise distances, like five kilometers, 10
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.640]   kilometers and all that stuff. And then you get into the ultra running world and it's like,
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.080]   sometimes it's the event. So like the Western- - The course itself is much more important than
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.320]   the distance. - Right. Yeah. So the Western States 100 is actually a hundred point two miles,
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.520]   which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it, especially when you figure like
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.280]   tangents are going to probably account for more than point two miles on a hundred mile race.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.160]   But the ultra trail Mont Blanc, that's listed as a hundred miler, but it's actually, I think like
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:36.640]   104, 105 miles. So, it's more, there's different cultures too. So the United States is definitely
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.040]   more motivated, I think, to try to get as close to the exact distance. You're going to hear maybe
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.920]   a little more grumbling if someone says, I signed up for this a hundred miler and it turned out to
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:49.040]   be a hundred and three miles versus like over in Europe, they don't really care too much about the
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.360]   distance. They're more interested in like a specific route or a loop. - Is consistency important
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.800]   in terms of the exact length of the route? So like you can compare performances from previous years,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.960]   or are they a little bit more flexible? Like they redefine the trail from year to year.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.640]   - Yeah. I mean, it's definitely hard to compare. I mean, there's events that,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:14.480]   take for example, I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men's side
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.400]   is Jim Walmsley. The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.200]   and not only is he the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at almost everything up to a
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   hundred miles. So there's a race called the Angeles Crest hundred miler. The trail has
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.840]   drastically changed from when they originally had that event. And it's a different time of year. So
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:42.000]   it's much warmer on that course. And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.600]   I can't chase that record. But I think Angela Crest, when he looks at the segments and the
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.080]   pacing for that one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.840]   So you have that, you have some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.400]   preserved, I guess you would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side. I mean,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.320]   Comrades is going to be very comparable from one year to the next, because that's a road race.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.640]   And that's where you get, you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:13.120]   that kind of like, I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.600]   someone who just says, I want to be competitive today. And maybe the weather is going to be 30
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.040]   degrees different from one year to the next on this course. But if I beat everyone on this day,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.520]   then I'm the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Mont Blanc or Western States 100. And
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.680]   my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race. And it doesn't matter when or how the
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.920]   course was or what the time even was to some degree. - When you were optimizing for trying
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:44.320]   to set the world record in the 100 miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like, what were
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:51.440]   the variables you were looking at? Is it more in the realm of the actual race day, the track,
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:57.680]   what it looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the race?
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.800]   - I mean, it evolved a bit. Like I think the, as I learned more about just like what is required
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:08.960]   to kind of really do that stuff. So there's some variables you can control for. I try to control
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.200]   for as many as I can. The big one that kind of stands out that you can't necessarily control for
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.680]   is it's pretty rare where you get an event where they're just doing 100 miles on a track. It's
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.880]   usually like an event of like a series of different events where they might be like,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.840]   some people out there doing 50K, some people out there doing 24, some day, like the event I did,
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.640]   there's six day folks out there. They're trying to see how far they can get in six days. So you
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.880]   have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the distance. So, track protocol is always
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.320]   like you pass on the outside. So if you're running one of the faster paces of the day,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.760]   which when you go on up to six days, you're gonna, and you're doing 100 miles, you're probably gonna
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.480]   be running faster than most people out there. Then you just end up running more because you end up
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.280]   running in lane two around the turns, unless sometimes lane three around the turns.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.080]   - So it's down to those little details that have a big impact.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.440]   - Yep. So I had to build that into my pacing strategy. I also have to build into the pacing
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:10.720]   strategy, like relative non-moving time. I did a race just recently, it was the US track and field
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.440]   100 mile road championships. And I did not stop once other than like, I guess I technically stopped
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.480]   like in the aid station for like a few seconds to like grab bottles and get myself wet. Cause it was
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.640]   like 94 degrees that day. But I didn't like stop at all during that race from like, what I would
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.360]   say is like a long period of time where we're getting up to like a minute, but that's pretty
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.280]   rare. Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19 minutes, I think I stopped three times for
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.640]   maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for sure, but I think it was like three to
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.280]   four minutes or something like that. So you gotta figure that into your pacing strategy, especially
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:51.360]   if you're chasing a specific time. Cause if I'm pacing for, at the time the world record was 1128.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:59.040]   So if I'm pacing for say 1127.30 or something like that, and I don't account for that three minutes
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.280]   of stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had planned on, but then I'm a minute off of the world
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.880]   record. So. - 1128, we're talking about 11 hours. We're talking about a hundred miles. Can you
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.960]   mention what the world record was? What kind of world record you set? Can you tell your own story
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.840]   here of what you were able to accomplish? - That world record that I broke actually just recently
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:28.800]   got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania, Alex Sorkin. Phenomenal race. I mean, he's won the
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.240]   24 hour world championships. He's won the Spartathlon, which is another big historic
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.080]   ultra marathon race. It's 153 miles. So it's getting a little more lengthy than some of the
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:44.160]   stuff that I've traditionally done. He ran 1114, I believe it was 56 or 57. So his pace was 645 per
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:50.000]   mile. Mine was 647 and a half in terms of just like the pacing strategy. I mean, it's just really
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.400]   cool because for me, the motivation with chasing the world record was, it was multifaceted. I think
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.720]   there was, as I kind of moved through, because I mean, it took me almost six years from the day I
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:09.760]   decided I wanted to chase that time to the day I actually did it. And through that five to six
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:16.080]   years, I think I merged from just like my number one goal was to try to break the world record to
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:22.160]   my number one goal is how fast can I run this thing? And then ultimately what needs to be done
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.760]   for a human to break 11 hours in a hundred miles? Because I think that's going to happen soon. I
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.880]   think it's going to happen in the next few years. What pace would that be? Sub 11 would be, I think
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:39.760]   it's like 635 right about per mile. You're moving quick, but not so quick that you're
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:45.520]   void of being able to think about everything as it's happening. So what's the pace in terms of,
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:53.040]   if you look for each of the one mile segments for the hundred miles, is it pretty steady?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.760]   In order to break 11 hours, would it be pretty steady? 635? Does it go up and down?
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   Do you speed up at the very end? What's the pacing? Maybe how much variability is there in the pacing
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.360]   for an optimal performance here? Yeah. So if you're talking about someone, let's say that
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.160]   there's someone, well, let's just take me for example. Let's say that we could just,
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.320]   we had this infinite knowledge and we knew for a fact a perfect performance for me would produce
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.680]   to 1059, but I'm not going a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 1059.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:33.520]   I would definitely want to either have a slight negative or a slight positive split.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:41.840]   And I think there's a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half and the
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:47.680]   second half isn't going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower the first
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.000]   half and a little bit faster the second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   So that's what you're referring to the split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and the
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.960]   second 50 miles. And you can break it down as tiny as you want. Like I think when you take out the
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.640]   outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that like three to four
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.840]   minute non-moving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight. I had a couple that
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:16.800]   were, it was weird because that track that I did that on was actually like 400 and some weird
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.400]   number like 438 meters or something like that. So I actually like ran like my numbers based on that.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.200]   So normally I'm dealing with 400 meters and then it's a little more like clean as to like what my
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.280]   lap splits are going to range from one event to the next. - So we're talking about running 100
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:40.640]   miles on a track. - Yeah. - And so then you can be really scientific about getting the pacing right.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   And you're running on the inside lane or is there some kind of tricks to this? Like are you
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.800]   alternating directions? - Yeah, they'll switch directions at most events every four hours.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.080]   So you'll do four hours one way and then they usually put a cone out. And once it hits like,
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:03.280]   like let's say it hits four hours, you finish the lap you're on and then you do a loop around and
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.360]   then you start the next, your next lap. - Would you say you take the exact same number of steps?
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:13.200]   Like when you're really in the groove, when you're taking the pacing, are we talking about that level
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:18.080]   of precision or is it a little bit more feel? - You mean like foot strike frequency? - Yeah,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.920]   like frequency then over the distance of the lap, would you say it's so precise that you're like,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.000]   you get in this groove where it's like perfect. - Yeah, gosh, you're making me wish I would have
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.600]   strapped more like a foot pod to my, but like, yeah, so I think like my guess is it's pretty
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.120]   precise. - Is there a video of this? Sorry, I keep interrupting. Is there a video of this?
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.640]   I've actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts foot
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:50.720]   strikes. - Oh really? - Yeah, for fun. - Yeah. - I was trying to understand, we'll talk about
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.080]   this later on. - We have the same definition of fun when I find myself on a track for all day and
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.800]   you find yourself counting foot strikes. - I was trying to understand if there's how much
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:07.920]   variability there's in extreme like elite performers within a particular race, but also
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:14.240]   across races. It was just interesting to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.240]   variability there is in the human body in the way they use legs to move quickly. - I think my guess
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:26.160]   would be that at the individual level, it's gonna be pretty precise, assuming the pacing is
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:32.720]   consistent. So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles than
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.720]   I did the first 50 miles. So my splits were very even most of the day. I actually ran some of my
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:42.560]   fastest miles at the end. So there's gonna be probably a slight variance from my fastest mile
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.240]   to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike, but probably not by a huge margin,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.040]   but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next. So you get someone whose
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.920]   gait is just a little bit different. So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.400]   on the outside of my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid forefoot striker. So that's gonna kind
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.720]   of impact my cadence to a degree. Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.480]   rear their foot or heel striker, and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:17.680]   So that person may have a little bit of a different cadence as well. So you get someone,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.160]   and I think you see this in elite marathoning too, which is gonna probably just be a much larger data
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:29.440]   pool, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this. And I
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.640]   think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but to the
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.920]   degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from one person to the next.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.080]   But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is gonna be, the slower they go,
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.760]   the lower their cadence is gonna be. But there's gonna be probably a range of optimal lowness and
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.600]   I don't know, probably optimal highness too. - If you can just linger on 11 hours,
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.680]   the person, first of all, would you like to be the person that breaks 11 hours? And second of all,
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:08.480]   the person that does break 11 hours, like what would it take? And third question is,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:14.320]   is it even possible in your intuition? - Yeah. I mean, I would be lying to you if I said I didn't
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:20.560]   wanna be the first person to break 11 hours in 100 miles. I think that would be a cool barrier
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.840]   to be the one to usher that in. But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:33.680]   it done from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.840]   is inevitable that it's gonna get broken. So I mean, we were talking about happiness before this,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:43.360]   right? So I've contemplated this in the past where I was thinking to myself like,
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.040]   if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record,
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.920]   and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:06.720]   an assessment of where my mind is at and where my focus is at and just reflect on how I'm behaving
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:15.840]   in life because it's gonna get broken, right? I mean, I could run 10.50 tomorrow and in 10 years,
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.760]   chances are that's no longer gonna be the world record anymore. Someone's gonna run faster than
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   that. So if you're living to hold on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:32.720]   which anytime you break a world record, you're moving the sport forward, then you have to look
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.840]   at that as like, that was my contribution. And whether I contribute again or not is kind of
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:43.600]   besides the point. What you want is that your performance or your contribution brings new
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.640]   people into the sport who are excited, motivated, and they can make their contribution. And then we
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.560]   can ultimately see, well, how fast can someone run a controlled environment 100 miler?
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.680]   And that's what I really wanna see 'cause I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport. I
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.320]   mean, I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport, I've been able to turn it into a career.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:06.080]   And I think there's other people who can do the same thing, and it's not necessarily gonna come
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.280]   at the expense of my career, but it's gonna bring more attention to the sport. It's gonna bring more
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.400]   interest in the sport. It's gonna open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have never
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.800]   thought about it, seen it, considered it. And to me, I think that's a much more rewarding goal
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:26.400]   than saying, I wanna break this record and I wanna hold it for decades, or I wanna die with
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   this record so I never have to see someone go faster than me. - Well, that's the progress of
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   human civilization. We stand on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.720]   - Well, and it's the other thing is just like, if you're honest with yourself too, it's,
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.640]   I mean, we're seeing this right now in the running world where new innovations come in,
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.600]   new technologies come in, new nutritional approaches come in. And then we see the new
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.000]   crop of folks have advantages that the old crop didn't have. And it can be easy to look back on
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.120]   that and say like, hey, well, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that,
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.680]   I would have run this. But then you're getting into that negative thought process again, which I
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.840]   generally try to stay out of. - I think the caveman, if I had fire,
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.440]   I would have done way better with this. - Look at these idiots up there with their
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.400]   cars. If I would have had a car back then, I would have been ruled the world.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:20.480]   - Let me just zoom up just briefly and ask you about kind of beauty and love.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.720]   What's the most beautiful thing about running to you? Why do you love it?
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:30.080]   - I think there's kind of a couple directions to look at it through, or lenses look at it through.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.360]   There's like the in the moment, right? There's always gonna be that run where
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.640]   you're clicking along and things just feel great. You get some endorphins and you get
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.320]   the quote unquote runner's high and that sort of stuff. And that's just like this great feeling
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:52.720]   that you can kind of tap into on the real in the moment type of level. My wife and I talk about
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:59.360]   this because she's a competitive ultra runner as well. And we'll have a day where we'll take a
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.000]   forced day off or something like that. And it's necessary, right? It's gonna allow the enjoyment
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.440]   to continue. But you get into this routine of I wake up in the morning, I do this run and that
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.400]   kind of gets my day started. That gets my energies up. I get that runner's high afterwards. You
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.120]   remove that from the equation for a rest day and you just sort of like, "Oh man, I feel like I
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:25.040]   never got started today." It's just this weird thing. I think it's funny because non-runners
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.280]   don't always necessarily recognize it because for them it's the complete opposite. They're like,
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.080]   "If I can get away from not having to run today, that's gonna be a good day."
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.840]   [laughter]
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.280]   But it's one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:43.120]   So that's purely from the running perspective, there's this joy of the runner's high,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.960]   of the post after the run you feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.040]   Yes. And I think that's one of the drivers from just a quality of life standpoint,
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.960]   and in the moment immediate gratification standpoint. But then there's like, I think,
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:04.880]   the bigger picture stuff or the longer term stuff. For me, that enjoyment is just the process of,
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:12.000]   "Okay, I'm starting at this fitness level and I'm gonna do these workouts. By doing these workouts,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.120]   I'm gonna see incremental progress from them." Then that's another kind of short-term gratification
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:23.680]   that's maybe a little longer than the day-to-day, but still shorter than a career or a buildup for
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.320]   a particular race where you're seeing yourself like, "Okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:33.920]   right now. And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four,
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.720]   I'm covering this much distance." And you can just see that progress.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.600]   It's almost like in elementary school when you get the gold star for reading a book, it's like,
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.760]   "Did that gold star really mean anything? I don't know, but I felt great when they gave it to me."
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.200]   [laughter]
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.200]   Something about just finding improvement. And people love to see improvement, I think. So
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.560]   that's where I think you can also get some value in it. We were saying, "I started here and I got
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:02.960]   there." And then I think there's also just like... I would call this maybe more the cherry on top,
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.840]   which is where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's gonna be the thing
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:14.960]   that shows up on the end result and where it identifies whether you did things right or wrong.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:22.320]   Yeah. So there's a sense in which training is a kind of preparation towards race day,
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:28.560]   and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist. You get to create this piece of art,
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:34.880]   and it might suck, it might be beautiful. I mean, in the grappling world, I see competition in that
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:41.760]   same way, when I feel the best about it, which is like... Sounds pretentious to say, but I'm
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.960]   trying to be the best version of myself in this particular day of competition and to do something
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:58.000]   that I'll be proud of in an artist way, not in some kind of numerical way, but as a holistic
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.840]   sense, like do something cool. In grappling, that means for me, that means not stalling,
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:10.880]   taking big risks and trying to dominate another person in the context of grappling,
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:18.560]   and do it, like push myself to the limit, both cardio wise and technique wise, and just play
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.400]   beautifully. I mean, you see this in kind of chess, there's systematic chess players,
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   and there's people that allow themselves to have those moments of genius, where they take the big
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:34.000]   risk that eventually pays off or doesn't. And that to me is art. I mean, there's art within running,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.400]   there's art within chess, there's art within grappling, and you get a chance. Like all the
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.680]   training is more like science, and then it feels like the competition day is art.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:49.200]   Yeah, I think that's a really cool way to look at it. And I think it's when you really open up the
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:55.600]   perspective of that too, it's like, even obviously, having a great day, winning the tournament or
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.880]   getting further than you were expected to, or beating someone who you've never beaten before,
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.120]   something like that. Or in the running perspective, achieving that goal time,
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.840]   that sort of stuff. Obviously, those are kind of like the ones you, when you're honest with yourself,
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:12.640]   you really want, and you're going to probably get the most satisfaction out of. But even when they
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:18.800]   don't go wrong, like maybe with your grappling tournament analogy, maybe the guy you're grappling
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   against does a move on you, and you're like, "I was not prepared for that move." So now the
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.240]   enjoyment becomes, "Okay, back to the drawing board. Now I need to find out what do I do when
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.040]   that happens to me next time." And that's where I think the why comes in again. Same thing with
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:40.080]   running. Maybe I make a mistake and eat something I didn't really want to eat or thought was going
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.760]   to work, but didn't work, and it costs me more time than I gained by having it or something like
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.920]   that. And then I go back to the drawing board and say, "Okay, well, I can't do that. That didn't
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.800]   work." Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to be able to do it. And I love that
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.320]   part of the sport, just the rearranging of things and adjusting and tinkering.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.920]   There's some sense in which the mistakes and the flaws give us meaning. Because if everything,
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:12.320]   if you weren't able to find mistakes in something you've done, it feels like the life would be void
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.760]   of meaning.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:24.080]   It's a lost opportunity too. When I look at even my 100-mile race of 11-19, I can find spots in
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.440]   there where I was like, "Oh, you know what? I could clean that up a little bit. Maybe if I do
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:34.320]   this differently." And that's going to get me a little bit faster. If I sat back and said, "Hey,
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.160]   well, things weren't great that day. Cool. Let's see if we can replicate it." Then I'd probably
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.200]   run 11-19 again.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.800]   So can we talk about training a little bit?
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:52.800]   What does your training look like year-round, day-to-day, hour-to-hour, like optimal? Maybe
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.600]   you want to pick a race in the context of what you want to discuss that. And also people should
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:05.280]   follow you on Instagram. You have a lot of interesting little glances into your training
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.920]   process and into your training thinking, which is quite fascinating. But if you look at an optimal
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.760]   training process, what does that look like?
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:18.720]   Yeah. So I think if we were looking at it from a philosophical level or an approach level,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.760]   I think there's some things that carry over from regardless of the distance.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:29.600]   So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least specific to what you're going to
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:35.360]   do on race day, but are still going to be important things in terms of improving your ability to
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:41.520]   perform on race day or maximizing your potential with the things that are specific, you do first.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:48.160]   I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance sport. I think maybe even more specifically with
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.600]   things like our ultra marathons or 100 milers where you want a really strong aerobic foundation
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:00.000]   or a base before you really start, I think, structuring things towards a specific one.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:09.840]   So for me, I think a target for me is oftentimes getting really fit at what my pace would be at,
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.440]   my aerobic threshold or what a lot of people will maybe call a maximum aerobic function.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.760]   The running world is weird where we have these terminologies where there's sometimes
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.040]   multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from an actual physiological
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.600]   reaction and one is just a feeling and stuff like that.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:32.880]   - You mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state. How important is it
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.920]   just to get running done versus running in a particular pace?
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:44.560]   - That would depend on the event, I would say to a degree. And there's conflicting ideas about
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:52.320]   how to structure it. I think a lot of times, time on feet in most cases is just going to be like,
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.400]   "I'm running easy, whatever feels easy that day." And that can be different from one day to the
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   next. I might feel great and that produces a much faster pace than if I feel really miserable or
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:09.200]   something like that. So that's why I think a lot of times running, they'll do the whole perceived
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:17.360]   effort or perceived exertion. And you're looking at understanding the response your body has to a
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.560]   certain effort level and you're supposed to target a certain effort level in order to get a certain
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.880]   response. So to maybe simplify that a little bit or make it a little clearer, I think I focus on
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:38.160]   essentially short intervals. I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs. I focus on race pace
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:44.640]   intensity, which is a lot of times what I'll build my long run around. But I'll also, those are the
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.280]   small pieces to the puzzle. - Those are the options you're working with?
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:52.160]   - Yeah, but I'm going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive aerobic base,
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.840]   which is going to probably be like 80% of the work. - So how do you build that massive aerobic
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.880]   base? What are we talking about? Just distance? - Distance and essentially, so I like to call it
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.680]   micro-stressing because you're going to always start at a different spot depending on where
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.440]   your fitness level's at and depending on where you're at as an individual. I'm going to be
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.000]   targeting my aerobic threshold. I'm going to get right up to it, but not necessarily cross over it.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.080]   It's been popularized as maximum aerobic function as kind of a training philosophy.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:24.000]   That philosophy in itself, I think maybe is a little more holistic where they're saying,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:31.200]   "Do this basically all the time." And by doing so, you're going to raise your aerobic potential by
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.560]   so much that you can kind of race yourself into shape at that point. And this would be maybe more
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.640]   specific for shorter distance or endurance runs where you're not going to really race yourself
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.920]   in the shape of 100 milers, but for 5Ks, you might. You might do a huge base building phase
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:52.080]   where you're going up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic threshold and you're
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:58.160]   watching your pace come down at that. So the rule there is basically if you're seeing improvement,
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.080]   that's the sign you're looking for or which would just be your pace dropping at that heart rate or
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.880]   at that intensity. And if you're seeing that continually go down, you're heading in the right
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.920]   direction. If you start seeing it go the opposite way, you're probably overreaching or you're trying
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:16.000]   to do too much of it. So that's kind of dictates how much, the dose, I guess you'd say.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.080]   - When we talk about max aerobic function, are we talking about heart rate as the ultimate,
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.240]   as the really important metric here? So maintaining a particular heart rate during the run?
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.560]   Is that the measure that, like how do you know you're in the right place?
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.440]   - Yeah, yeah. And then that's where it gets a little tricky because like unless you go into
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.920]   a lab and get your aerobic threshold tested, it's really hard to have like an exact number on it.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.760]   You know, Dr. Phil Maffetone with the maximum function process, he'll say 180 minus your age
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.320]   is gonna give you your- - Yeah, that's the math 180 formula
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.400]   that I thought was fascinating. It's like in the same way E equals MC squared is fascinating,
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.120]   that there could be a formula that captures like optimal running. So that for people who don't
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.640]   know that's 180 minus your age, if you train at that heart rate, if you run at that heart rate,
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.960]   you're going to progress a lot. - And here's the advantage of that.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.320]   I think like with any of these things, you wanna look at it through where are the advantages here,
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.640]   and I need to account for those. And then where are the potential disadvantages and then decide
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.040]   for me as an individual, do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages? And what's the
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.520]   alternative approach? And is that gonna produce more advantages or less? So with maximum aerobic
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:29.360]   function, here's some advantages. Like it is low enough intensity where you can train pretty
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:36.800]   consistently at a fairly high volume with a very low injury risk, with very low like things that
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.120]   are gonna maybe lower your quality of life, like muscle damage and things like that. It's a more
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.480]   efficient way in the sense that you're gonna be like prioritizing like fat metabolization, which,
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.920]   I mean, if you're looking at like Jeff Folek and, or Dr. Jeff Folek and Dr. Dominic D'Agostino,
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.560]   some of their research and things like that, like they're gonna show that, that's gonna be a little
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.880]   cleaner way to go about things from just a recovery standpoint, a breakdown standpoint.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.040]   - So they could be like a, what they call like a fat adapted athlete. So you can
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:12.000]   go to your fat stores for energy if you're applying this. What is it called by the way? MAF 180?
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.640]   - Yeah.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.840]   - Is that a good, is it good? What are your thoughts about in general for yourself and
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.040]   for the broader population?
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.280]   - I think the MAF 180 formula is about as good of a formula as you're gonna find in terms of
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.440]   capturing as many people as you can get away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.840]   Like any of these things, I mean, it's more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.000]   that 180 minus your age is probably gonna be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.720]   figure out where that is. There's some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.760]   that I like to do. If I'm, let's say I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:55.600]   and it was like, I'm running along and I'm just like, my breathing is labored. I'm, you know,
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.320]   I'm struggling to get a sentence out without gasping for breath. Well, that's my body telling
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.000]   me I'm probably not actually at my true like MAF number or my true, like underneath my true aerobic
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.840]   threshold, like aerobic threshold and maximum function. You should be able to do that for hours
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.000]   and you should be able to breathe pretty efficiently.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.640]   - And talk.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.200]   - Yep. Carry a conversation. Other people will say like you, another way to kind of gauge it,
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.360]   if you can breathe in your nose and out your mouth, that's not necessarily the best way to do
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.720]   on a, from a performance standpoint, but it can be a good kind of governor that will allow you to,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.840]   like, if you can, if you can no longer breathe in your nose and out your mouth, you're probably
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.040]   going too fast to actually technically be at your MAF pace or under your MAF pace.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.520]   - Yeah. I had a, actually when I was in better shape, I had trouble getting to that MAF number.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:44.640]   I found myself like, I would be doing way too much work. Like-
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.760]   - It was too hard to do it?
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:51.600]   - It was too hard to get to that number. I was running a much lower heart rate, like 10 to 20,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.800]   what do you call that? Beats lower. And that's, I was still for myself, happy with the pace. It
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.960]   was a good pace and I felt good. I was smiling and enjoying life. And the moment I take myself to that
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:12.320]   level of like the MAF 180 level, that's like, that felt like a real work. And it felt like I can't do
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.760]   that for five, 10, 15 miles. Like I started feeling it like this is a one or two mile thing.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:26.320]   But I think his answer to that, I feel Mephitone's answer is maybe you're supposed to like,
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.840]   what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that, or build up your,
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.720]   maybe like I'm too weak, musculature wise to like, yeah. Like that's a sign that you need to work on
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.160]   some stuff. You can't just keep enjoying life. - There's two ways to look at that, I think.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:49.440]   And I think you're right on. I think that what the advice from that kind of a process would say is
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.640]   either you're doing too much of it. So it's getting too hard for where your skeletal muscle
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.520]   system is currently at for that particular activity. So like, it can be different too.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.680]   Like if you're cycling versus running, that's a little bit of different mechanic where it can be
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.760]   different where you could take a super fit cyclist and then put them on, the amount of volume they're
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.680]   gonna be able to tolerate relative to what you're gonna do when you remove like impact forces and
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.920]   things like that is gonna be lower if they haven't been practicing that activity. So for you, like,
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.200]   you know, you're prioritizing like wrestling and mixed martial arts, or not mixed martial arts,
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:31.040]   but jujitsu type stuff. So, you know, running is maybe kind of that secondary activity versus the
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.920]   primary activity. But yeah, so what they would say is probably like maybe instead of doing that,
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   let's say you were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.160]   too hard to continue, they'd say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable with
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.480]   20, then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:57.600]   One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:05.520]   great. Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right. Maybe I was doing too
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.160]   big of steps, not the, so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.320]   the form. - Economy of your form.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:17.040]   - The economy, the efficiency, yeah. So that was the intuition, like I was doing something wrong,
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.280]   but I suppose that's the benefit of these kind of formulas. It challenges you to think like,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.240]   how can I improve this kind of stuff? - Well, and it also, it simplifies it so much
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.360]   that you're forced to, right? You're forced to optimize within that real strict parameter versus,
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.760]   am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong? Or am I doing my like long intervals
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.040]   right, but my short intervals, and then you just, it kind of complicates things when you start
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.040]   throwing a lot of stuff there. And for most people, especially when they're first getting started,
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:50.320]   you know, you can't overcomplicate it, or you're just gonna like, you're gonna do like a bunch of
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.200]   half right, half wrong things, and then not really know where your progress or your deficits are
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.800]   necessarily at. So I do think this is an amazing approach, especially for people who are just
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:07.600]   getting into it and building that foundation, where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.760]   little bit, especially when you start to get into these events that are operating well outside that
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.160]   intensity. So you take something like, you know, let's say it's a race that takes you in the
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.960]   neighborhood of around like 12 minutes or something like that, then you're gonna be running significantly
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.520]   faster than your maximum function pace. So most of the research is gonna say at some point in time,
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.520]   you need to get around to practicing the pace at which you're going to perform at, and really
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:40.880]   fine tuning the mechanics, the efficiencies, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.560]   you're going to try to compete at. So there's obviously like a large range of targets there
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.160]   when we talk about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter events,
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.160]   like five kilometers, and then you also have 100 mile races, which are going to typically be quite
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.640]   a bit below your maximum aerobic function in especially on these trail races. I need to admit
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:04.960]   something. So I don't measure the runs at all in terms of time. I get competitive with myself. So I
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.840]   kind of decided that running for me is going to be this thing where I just go by feel. Is it possible
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.520]   to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have running as part of your life and be a good
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:21.040]   performer in running? - I actually think that's where you want to get to. The problem is most
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:26.000]   people have a hard time getting to that because they'll go out and they'll run with a friend and
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.680]   match their pace, or they'll go out and they'll say, well, I want to run this pace. So they'll
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.920]   target that pace or target a specific heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.360]   feel good doing it. So I think like once you, I mean, obviously I think when you put a race on
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.760]   the calendar, if your goal is performance, it's a little harder to just say like, well, I'm going
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.720]   to run whatever feels good today. Because eventually you have to get around to doing what's
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.280]   specific. But from just a fitness standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint,
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.760]   I think it's totally fine to go out and say, I'm going to run what feels good today. And, you know,
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.040]   maybe someday you will feel like at the end of the run, I'm going to do a couple of sprints just to
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.200]   get some, you know, that, because it does, that one's a hard one to kind of jumpstart. But once
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.560]   you do it and you realize how kind of good it feels maybe to throw in a few accelerations at
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.320]   the end of a run, and then you, you say, oh, wow, that feels pretty good to do that. I feel a little
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.720]   more accomplished. - That's right. That's a forcing function. But I like to finish runs with sprints
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.640]   anyway. - Okay. Because you're already there. - Without, right. You don't need to, the timing,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.720]   I'm afraid of the time of becoming a drug, but the flip side of that, it's a useful tool to get you
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   to learn the right form, the right feel, like what it feels like to have, to be in good shape. And
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.640]   then you can throw out the time. - Well, I think too, with, with feel running and what I mean by
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.920]   that is that it's kind of back to that perceived effort thing where like you do enough of it and
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.840]   you start being able to recognize, like I can go out and if you said, okay, run, you know,
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:52.000]   60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know where that is on my heart rate.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.120]   And I could go up there and just say like, okay, I know what that feels like and go out and run
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.760]   that feel. And I'm going to hit that spot. Like I bet you if we'd looked at my heart rate data
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.800]   after that, it'd be right in there. And I wouldn't have to look at it. Some of that's just experience.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.480]   - Yeah. - Some of it's just understanding, like,
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.080]   when, like noticing the physiological responses when you cross over versus step a little bit too
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.320]   below it. You can catch yourself daydreaming and forget. I'll do this sometimes too where
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.480]   I'll be tired. Cause I'm kind of like you too, where when I'm getting really fit, especially
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:23.600]   with my foundation, like I got to, you know, I'm moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold. So
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.560]   like if I start daydreaming too much, I can notice, oh, I'm drifting back a little bit.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.080]   I look down at my heart rate, my, oh yeah, I'm 10 beats under. You know, so you do it,
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.760]   it does take a little bit of, I think just awareness. But it's also not necessarily
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.720]   something where you have to be so exact that you're hitting, you know, an exact heart rate
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.560]   all the time. There's usually a range. And there's even like some fluctuations where like,
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.720]   if you've been healthy for a year or two without any injuries and you've been fit,
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.320]   that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function if you're using that
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.440]   as kind of your target from the 180 minus your age formula.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.440]   - So let's try this, lay this out for yourself, but for others, you offer ready-made plans for
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:07.600]   people, you know, depending on their, I think the key thing there is the distance. Maybe you can
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.560]   elaborate, but what does that plan look like usually? What are the key options as you've
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:21.600]   already kind of mentioned, and how does your week look like? How do a lot of people's week look like
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:28.480]   in terms of splits? Are we talking about, you know, in terms of rest days, in terms of how often do you
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.320]   speed work versus longer distance? You mentioned long runs. Like, is there something you could say
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.920]   that's generally applicable about the structure of these plans?
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.640]   - The ready-made plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy, and it's going to be like kind of
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.600]   like lockstep in that. So for those, like, there's just always going to be a sacrifice when you do
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.240]   like a ready-made plan because you're removing the individual context there. So for folks who
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.440]   are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a personalized coaching plan
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.320]   with them where we sit down and we actually look at their strengths, their weaknesses,
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:07.440]   and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it. And it also like, it avoids a
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.360]   situation where, oh, my ready-made plan says I'm supposed to do this run today, but I don't feel
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.840]   great today. So what do I do? I mean, some people are fine with that because they're aware enough of
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.000]   like the process that they can adjust it themselves. Other folks just need a little
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.800]   more support. So that's kind of the difference there. But in terms of the structure of it,
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.280]   it kind of goes with an approach where we're saying you build this foundation,
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.000]   you're going to spend, you know, usually anywhere between 8 to 12 weeks just building up
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.760]   your aerobic foundation. You're going to be doing a lot of stuff that are kind of at,
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.680]   I call them base runs, but they're basically your maximum aerobic function or you're up to
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.840]   your aerobic threshold type stuff. And they're really going to get really fit with that. And
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it's time to get into the specifics of whatever
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.960]   distance they're doing. So if it were, it will differ will be like if they're doing right now
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.720]   on those plans, I think I've got 5k half marathon, marathon, 50k, 80 to 100k and then 100 miles.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.400]   So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations is going to be different than if they pick the
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.440]   100 mile plan, you're going to see some of the same workouts show up in that plan. It just can
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:18.080]   be different areas of it. So once they're really fit at that, you know, that foundational level,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.640]   then, you know, if they're doing say 100 mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals,
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.440]   which I would on my plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes. It's kind of that
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.160]   short interval range. Can you describe what you mean by short interval? It's like a sprint and
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:38.640]   then a rest? Yeah. Yeah. So I'll use basically like I'll use like a basically a 12 minute time
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.200]   trial. And that's going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.440]   to be for some of those when they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.680]   But usually when we're up to like above a minute, and certainly up to four minutes,
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.160]   like whatever pace or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial,
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.920]   where they're just seeing how far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be kind of like about where
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.120]   they're going to target for those intervals. So then those intervals are going to be structured.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.200]   Let's say they're doing two minute intervals, they're gonna do two minutes at that intensity
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   that they could do for 12 minutes at a time trial, then they're gonna do a two minute real easy jog,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.960]   or maybe even walk just to kind of bounce back. And they're going to repeat it. How do you figure
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.160]   out how far you can go in 12 minutes? Is that just a trial and error you build up to it? There's
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:27.680]   formulas? What? Yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less brutal.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:34.640]   Where you kind of, I haven't really dove into these that that in depth yet, I know like,
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.000]   that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.960]   and then a slightly longer one. And then like another one where like at the end one,
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.440]   that last one will kind of indicate what it is. And so you're doing less of it to get the same
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:55.680]   answer to the question. But sometimes I think when it's someone who's new, I'd rather than just do a
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.440]   12 minute time trial, because it's easy for them to execute in the sense that it's pretty clear,
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.840]   you do a warm up, you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches, and you just run as hard as you
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.840]   can for 12 minutes as evenly paced as you can manage. And I mean, if it's going to produce
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.760]   the data I'm looking for. And I mean, it's also- No matter what happens, it'll produce the data.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.840]   Yeah. I mean, you can you can screw it up, I guess you can go way too fast. And then you have
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.520]   this scenario where like, oh, it looks like your, you know, your first two minutes were drastically
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.160]   faster than your last two. And then it's like, oh, we maybe screwed that one up. But I mean,
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.080]   really, like, you don't even need to do the time trial, technically. A lot of times you can go off
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:42.800]   of feel like what we described with the threshold stuff. And, and, you know, it's a high enough
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:49.120]   intensity where, where like, you can start to kind of like, your body's going to kind of limit you to
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.920]   a degree where if I said we didn't do the time trial, and just started doing the intervals,
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.720]   we could figure out that, you know, if they're doing them right or not, if we see a scenario
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.720]   where oh, it looks like these first two intervals were significantly slower than the last two,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.560]   chances are we're still not quite dialed in in terms of what the intensity is that you should
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.360]   be targeting for those. And as you do a few, you just get to know the pacing of it a little better.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.720]   And then you start seeing more even splits. So like, you know, their first two minute intervals
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.000]   pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or, you know, I guess we'd be looking
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.320]   at distance if we're doing time. So like you went approximately the same distance on that last one
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.640]   as you did the first one. And then we're just looking for improvement over time. So you know,
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:32.480]   we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving that we're going to still include
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.920]   kind of foundational running volume where you're going to be running like an easy pace and
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.160]   enjoyable pace kind of in the interim, and then there's gonna be some rest days. And that's gonna
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.840]   be where the levels come in my like level one plans are gonna be like four day a week training
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.320]   plans level two are gonna be five day level three are gonna be six day with one day off.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.040]   And you can obviously operate outside of those, those those are just the ones that I put up for
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.720]   the ready made when I'm coaching people kind of personalized, we just we look at like what their
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.600]   history is with running their schedule, all sorts of stuff, because oftentimes people get hung up on
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.400]   like, well, what are the elites doing? What are the professionals doing? What are the Olympians
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.000]   doing? It's like, well, it's like, what the Olympians are doing is they're waking up and
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.400]   they're living and breathing everything around this one race that they're gonna do in four years,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   or so it's like, we need to step away from that if you're working, you know, 10 hours a day,
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.520]   and you got kids and all this other stuff, too. So there's a lot of variables that make it more
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.920]   interesting to coach someone who's actually like not an elite athlete, or someone who's a
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.440]   professional athlete, I should say. The but but yeah, so they're, they're gonna do that stuff,
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:37.600]   those those shorter intervals for probably about like four to six weeks, if they're doing if they're
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.560]   doing a longer race, like 100 miles, if they were doing, say a 5k, we'd start bringing those workouts
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.840]   in near the end of their plan, because that's gonna be specific to their race pace, that can be
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.000]   the intensity that maybe they're doing for, you know, like a 3k or 5k or something like that.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.480]   So it's gonna be more relative to what they're going to use. So it follows that philosophy,
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.680]   the plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early. And then we start
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:06.480]   phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end of the plan.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.560]   And then the distance of or the time that you're going to spend out doing whatever event is going
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.360]   to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there. I wonder if I could ask you for some sort of
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:22.800]   advice, maybe almost maybe look at me as a case study of a particular runner, and then
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:31.040]   see how we can plan stuff out. So which context to give? Okay, so I have been first, let me say
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:35.360]   how much we're currently in Austin, I want to say how much I love Austin for many reasons.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:42.960]   First and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there's so much love that I've experienced
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.960]   immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I've been in. It's, it's not
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:55.440]   quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately. I mean, I really love it here in Austin.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.160]   And because I've been going through a bunch of stressful stuff, I just kind of gave myself a
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.560]   chance to say, okay, I'm going to stick to a diet of carnivore keto, but I'm going to eat as much
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:15.280]   as I want. Because primarily because just barbecue was part of the love I was getting here. And I was
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.760]   like, either I resist or just give in, I decided to give in and actually use this as an opportunity
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.440]   to relax and have fun for the past three, four months, plus whiskey, and so on. And then the
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.240]   training kind of all I also let go of the training a little bit, just to relax to really focus on the
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.360]   work, focus on the love I've been getting all those kinds of things. But now, I just kind of
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.680]   want to set a goal for myself to get back into both competing and grappling, but also doing a
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.200]   hanging out with David Goggins and doing a conversation with him. But almost this is my
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.360]   own personal kind of race that I'm looking forward to. And in terms of distance, that means running
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:02.240]   with David, something like a marathon plus plus. It's like, it's unclear what plus so my goal would
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:07.840]   be to continue eating carnivore, which is a whole nother topic I'd love to talk to you about. I feel
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.920]   great psychologically, sort of in terms of mental performance in my work when I eat carnivore,
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:22.080]   and physically, I love it. I've never felt any kind of need for carbs to improve performance in
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.400]   my running or anything else. Combine that with fasting, intermittent fasting, or eating once a
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:33.600]   day. I just, that's when I feel the best. What else? I also feel best, and this is something
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:42.080]   you can push back on. I feel best when I just run every day, like no breaks ever, and usually the
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:49.040]   same way every day. So like, I know this is suboptimal. It'd be interesting to hear your
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:55.120]   opinion of just how suboptimal that is. So I think that actually lays out like where my mind is. I'm
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:02.720]   happy eating carnivore once a day. I like running every day. The goal is to run a marathon in two
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.120]   months-ish, two months plus, and then about three months to do a bunch of competitions and grappling.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.640]   - Okay. With those parameters, I think like you actually probably would be a great candidate for
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   a maximum aerobic function training strategy. Like you want that consistency where I'm going
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:24.160]   to do the same thing each day. You don't want to beat yourself up so much any one day that you
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.680]   can't get out and do it the next one. That's the sweet spot with maximum aerobic function
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:35.120]   is the trademark there is that you can keep going and keep doing it again and again and again,
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.200]   because as long as you're not going out one day and trying to do twice as much as what you're
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.520]   ready for, for that one specific... The key for you is going to be picking the right starting point
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:49.520]   and then building from there on what that day kind of entails in terms of how much running you do.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:57.040]   So where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided that it's a hard, fast rule
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.800]   that you run an hour every day, seven days a week, but we find out that to run your maximum
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.600]   aerobic function means you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes. Then what you would
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.760]   maybe do is you would run underneath your maximum aerobic function for the first 15 minutes and the
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.920]   last 15 minutes. Maybe throw some of those strides in there if you want to do that at the very end.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.680]   And then that middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum aerobic function target.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.600]   - Got it. - And then maybe after
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.720]   four weeks, you start noticing, you know what? This 30 minutes isn't wearing me out near as much
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:32.960]   as it used to. I feel like I could easily push past that. Well, let's up that to 40 minutes.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:37.360]   So that's 60. You're always staying within that 60 minute parameter that keeps your schedule
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.960]   consistent, your routine consistent. - I'm wearing a heart rate monitor
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.680]   as I run to monitor it. - Sure, yeah.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.960]   - Actually. - You could do that.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:50.320]   You could go perceived effort. I like to use them in tandem in the sense that early on, I'll
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:56.000]   maybe look at my heart rate a little more often, especially for shorter length. Heart rate can get
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   messy the longer you go. So I end up kind of maybe stepping away from heart rate a little more
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.800]   than some will at a certain point because ultimately I'm going to be usually training
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.760]   or working with someone to run a race that's really long and they have cardiac drift, dehydration,
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.640]   heat, and things that are going to make the heart rate super messy.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:20.000]   - Yeah, but probably your ability to measure perceived effort is exceptionally good. Mine
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.840]   is actually really weak. - Okay, heart rate then.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.440]   - I need to do the still the work of connecting heart rate to the perceived effort.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.360]   - Yep, and that's exactly what I would use heart rate for then. And you'll get to a point
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:34.800]   probably by like in the first couple of months where you can still lean on heart rate if you
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.880]   want, but it'll be kind of one of those things where you keep looking at it, you're like, "Oh,
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.600]   wow, I can guess it." And you play a game with yourself too. And you say, "Well,
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.040]   how close can I guess?" - Yeah.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.880]   - You'll get it. So like for me, what I'll do is I'll go, I'll do the run and then I'll look at
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.720]   the heart rate afterwards and be like, "Oh, cool. I was right there." Or I remember feeling like I
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.440]   was speeding up a little bit there and the show is right there on the heart rate.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.800]   - I also love sort of something we haven't talked about. I love pushups and pull-ups,
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:04.160]   so like bodyweight workouts. Again, it's mostly mental. I just enjoy the mental challenge of it.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:11.040]   I also like, it makes me feel like if all I'm doing is running, it makes me feel I'm not like-
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.320]   - One dimensional. - Yeah, one dimensional. I mean,
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:19.280]   there's some aspect to running that's not to be like hippie about it, but like, you know,
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.800]   you're with nature, you're running. It's like we're born to do this thing. And that same way,
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.520]   I feel like when I'm doing pushups and pull-ups, I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:35.920]   Like it's like this bodyweight exercises have that way about them. It doesn't have that dumbbell
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:41.360]   feel or doing bench press or squats, squats with weight. When you're just doing squats,
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.840]   bodyweight, when doing pushups and pull-ups, bodyweight, even just basic ab stuff, core stuff,
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.240]   bodyweight. I don't know. I just love the way I feel doing that. So it's usually,
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.520]   I forgot to mention that part. I combine that with the running afterwards,
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.960]   doing some basic bodyweight stuff. - Yeah, and I think like you're gonna get
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:05.280]   from, if we're not looking at it from like specifically like training a pace in order to get
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:11.600]   both the skeletal muscle adaptations as well as the cardiovascular benefits, you're probably
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.680]   tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that bodyweight stuff. Unless you're doing,
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.920]   I guess. - No rest. It's very quick.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.560]   - Okay. So you're getting pretty high heart rate from that?
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.760]   - Yeah, yeah. Very hard. - Okay.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.720]   - Higher than running. Yep. - So you're checking that box there
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:32.080]   from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness, overall fitness standpoint. I think you wanna
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   keep your running more aerobic then because you're getting that, and you're probably getting it from
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:42.080]   like your grappling workouts too, I would guess. So there's just not as big of a need for you from
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:49.440]   a big picture standpoint to be doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well. And it sounds
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.360]   like you prefer not to. - That's right. So I mean,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.960]   what about the distance of marathon versus a hundred miles? Is that a big difference? What's
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   a good goal to work towards? Is it marathon and the rest of it just takes care of itself?
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.920]   - Yeah. So you wanna do a marathon and then ultimately do a hundred mile after that? Is
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.480]   that what you're saying? - I have no idea what the guy-
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.480]   - Oh, so he's gonna tell you spot on what you're doing. So you have to be ready for anything.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:23.520]   - For anything. My own personal goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:30.080]   marathon. The longest I've ever run is 22 miles, but there's been many stretches in my life where
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.480]   I would regularly run, like the long run would be close to 20 miles. And then I was comfortably
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:44.160]   running 10 miles four months ago. It was like forever ago until I injured myself a little bit
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.040]   by running in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don't realize how much
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.760]   you appreciate your toes until you stub them. - That big toes where all that power comes off.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:01.520]   - Yeah. And so it was surprising how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.240]   unpleasant running, how much I hated running with it. And then I kept like coming, trying to get
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:12.000]   back out there to run to think, I think it's okay. And no, it's not okay. You really need to let it
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.400]   fully heal. At least that was my experience. I couldn't like just suck it up. It was making it
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.000]   worse every time. It was one of those injuries that could really feel, even though it's so small,
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:27.120]   but it's essential. So is there any difference between the goal of marathon or a hundred miles,
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.720]   would you say? Should I be prepping for a hundred miles if that's at all a possibility?
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.240]   - The big difference is going to be like you're dropping intensity significantly by going up to
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.640]   a hundred miles versus the marathon. So the maximum aerobic function, I think is actually
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.680]   going to feed into that maybe a little bit better. It's probably gonna be a little closer
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:50.400]   depending on where, I mean, it all varies a bit. Cause like people will focus on specific distances
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:57.440]   and they'll get very efficient and very adapted to that. So like the, it kind of like, it's what
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:03.360]   makes running kind of messy where like you'll get, for example, like the average person can hit their
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.280]   like lactate threshold for probably about like 60 minutes or something like that. Whereas you get
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.280]   these elite marathoners who've been basically spending their entire life preparing for a
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.480]   marathon race. They can push almost up to their lactate threshold and at their lactate threshold
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:23.120]   for almost like two hours. So it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens,
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.880]   but you don't really have to worry about that too much because you're not really focusing on
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.280]   being the best possible hundred miler or the best possible marathoner you could be. You want
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.640]   enough overall fitness that you can just do either one of them without absolute misery because you did
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.400]   the couch to a hundred miles. So I think like for a hundred miles, the biggest difference, I think,
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:47.040]   given your context is just like the more physical things you are doing, the better prepared you're
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.200]   going to be for the hundred mile. So it's almost given your context, I wouldn't say irrelevant.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.320]   You want to be doing running, but you're going to be doing that once you put it in your program.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:02.080]   It sounds like it's going to be pretty locked in. You're going to want to also like, like
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.520]   if you view it this way, it's probably going to be more mentally beneficial to where, hey,
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.680]   today I did my run. I did my body weight exercises. I did some grappling practice. I spent
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.800]   three hours working out today. If you think of it like that, then you're moving your body,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.720]   you're doing things that are active for a good chunk of the day, especially relative to most
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:30.800]   people. So that's going to actually be very helpful for you. The problem or the battle to
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.720]   get over is going to just be like, you're going to break down physically running a hundred miles.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:42.240]   And you're gonna break down physically running a marathon too. So like the, you might just have
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.080]   to push through a little more discomfort, like from a physical standpoint, compared to be if
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.440]   you decided I'm gonna do everything I can in these next like 24 weeks to be able to run a full hundred
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:30:01.120]   miler. Would you say it's physical or is it mental discomfort? Like, I mean, isn't everything
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:08.240]   physically uncomfortable? Like what do you train for if you're training for the chaos of, so it's
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.240]   not necessarily the hundred miles, it's the chaos of the unexpected, which might include a hundred
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.640]   miles, but it might also include a thousand pushups in my case. So like- - You need a big
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.240]   jack of all trades is what you need to be. - Yeah. But also like building up the confidence
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:27.200]   or maybe not, I don't know. How do you survive a thousand pushups? It's a combination of
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:32.240]   confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing. Not necessarily the actual
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:41.600]   number, but like doing crazy stuff. And the second is probably, well, okay, the base strength and
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:48.880]   endurance and also just the practicing that process of not quitting. I feel like that's one
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.520]   of the things I really need to do in the running space is like doing slightly unpleasant things
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:59.840]   where I'm practicing that, like bringing my mind back and saying, nope, I'm going to keep doing it.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:04.000]   And part of the running every day has that benefit because some days you really don't
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.880]   feel like running and doing that, then you're practicing that muscle of doing it anyway.
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.200]   I don't know if there's something you can say in terms of advice, how to practice
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:22.560]   like doing something unpleasant every day, frequently. - Yeah. What I would do with that
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:29.600]   is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to the next, if you can. So
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:36.400]   the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be it becomes like
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.640]   a negative feedback loop in your physiologically, potentially, as well as mentally, where if the
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:48.240]   entire running process is miserable, you're going to be miserable when you step on that starting
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.720]   line, whether it's a marathon or a hundred miles. - You've trained yourself that running equals
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.360]   miserable. - Well, and here's the thing, if you look at just like, here's where the literature
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:03.040]   says on paper are like the dozen workouts you should do in a training plan. And this is how
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:07.120]   you should structure them right down to the minute. And you just say like, I'm going to give
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.880]   everyone this schedule and they're going to do this every time, rinse and repeat. My biggest concern
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:18.480]   with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position where the training is so boring
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:25.280]   and so monotonous that like if they hit a roadblock mentally, they're going to fall apart very quick
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.960]   because they've already exhausted themselves mentally just trying to do the same old interval
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:35.040]   every time, doing the same old workout. And it doesn't necessarily have to be like one specific
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:41.040]   plan in its entirety. It could just be like the mix of things within it. So like rather than like,
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:45.680]   if I just said, oh, we're going to do three minute intervals, this entire short interval process or
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:51.360]   two minute intervals or four minute intervals or 60 second intervals, by that sixth week,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.960]   they might be so sick of that, that they're not actually maximizing their potential within that
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.840]   because there's no flavor there. And then they're also actually getting less out of themselves than
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:04.080]   they would if we just got a little more creative and said, okay, let's mix this up and let's do
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:10.400]   four one minute intervals, then take a little bit of a break and then we'll do three minute intervals
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.600]   or at least changing it up from week to week so that they have something different showing up,
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.320]   even though we're addressing the same kind of physiological adaptation.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:22.640]   So like, I think what you want to do is you want to introduce the misery, you want to be able to
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.480]   test yourself to the degree where like when you can recognize these points of I don't want to be
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:33.360]   here, but I can do it, push through it, but recognize that like, there's not necessarily
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.200]   going to be one event that you want to lean on to get that from because you won't want to make
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.880]   that one event so miserable that you don't want to do it when it comes time for the challenge.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.960]   So if you can possibly say like, okay, on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I'm going to go
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.360]   10 pushups more than I want to, I'm going to get to that point where I'm like, there's no more,
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.600]   and then I'm gonna do 10 more. And you're going to make that one miserable. And then maybe on,
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.120]   you know, Thursdays, you decide to do like some of those sprints or something at the end where
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.880]   you do a few of them, and you're like, okay, this is where I'd be comfortable to stop like,
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.280]   well, I'm going to do two more of them because I know I don't want to do two more of them,
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.800]   but mix that up. So you're not, so at least you're getting enjoyment from some of it and not
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.960]   just getting complete disgust from the entire process.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.000]   - Yeah, there's actually quite a lot of ways that I can introduce misery into the pushups
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.880]   and the running, get creative, including, you know, even just like stuff outside of the running,
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:30.320]   like taking a freezing cold showers, those kinds of things, just introducing random kind of chaos
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.760]   into the system or having conversations with people as an introvert, it's terrifying.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.280]   - More podcasts.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:46.240]   - More podcasts. So I'm now starting the training and Zach, you've been kind enough to also kind of
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.920]   be willing to help me out throughout this process. So I look forward to where that goes. It's kind of
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:35:00.160]   fascinating. On the diet side, you're one of the many things that make you fascinating
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.920]   is you've played with diet as well, and you're somewhat famous, I would say, for doing low carb
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:11.280]   or playing with low carb or meat-based diets. Can you describe the potential, like how you're
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:17.440]   thinking about that has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or a keto
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.800]   diet or a meat-based diet in training as an ultra marathon runner?
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   - Yeah, and I think like where a lot of times things get confusing for people here is the
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:31.520]   context of it too, where it's like they want an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport?
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.920]   And it's like, well, endurance sport is quite wide ranging as we've talked about many times here.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.440]   So there's going to be differences, I think, in just like what you want to maybe necessarily
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.280]   prioritize both for the event you're doing and the intensity that's required for it,
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.800]   the training that's required for that event. And then also the individual component too,
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.080]   where I think this one often gets overlooked, where we tend to say like, well, we've got all
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:00.960]   these Olympic medalists at the marathon and below distance who are eating a moderate to high
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:07.120]   carbohydrate diet. So everyone needs to do that if they want to reach their potential in say the 3K
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:13.600]   to the marathon. And in a perfect world, maybe that would be true, but there's a lot of other
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.960]   variables that often get forgotten then that could positively or negatively impact that decision
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.920]   choice. So I think Dr. Jeff Volk has done a great job of kind of highlighting this in the sense
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.600]   that when he works with people, he works with people in the health sphere as well as the
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.960]   performance sphere. And he's one of the main guys at Virta Health who's, they've got like a 60%
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:40.160]   success rate with working with folks with type 2 diabetes to reverse their type 2 diabetes.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:45.440]   And I mean, that's an astounding, when you think of just any nutritional protocol,
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.080]   it's success rate, they're all incredibly low. They're very, very low. And the big difference
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:54.400]   with his is the coaching aspect of it. Like they give support. So these people like have someone
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.840]   to turn to when they make a mistake, or if they're thinking about doing something differently, or
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.320]   they don't know what to do, rather than just kind of throwing, throwing it all up in the air and
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.800]   quitting, they have a resource there. And that's probably a big reason why that's the success rate
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.840]   that they have with that is they put those support mechanisms in place. That picture needs to be
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.040]   carried into the performance world or the running world to where, you know, we may have just been
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:26.320]   identifying that, you know, Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:31.840]   of their diet coming from carbohydrate is gonna just, it's gonna filter those ones towards the
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.160]   Olympics, filter those towards the Olympics. Yeah. And that doesn't mean that like,
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:41.520]   if we would have taken, say, the gold medals in the 5k and put them on a low carb diet,
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.280]   they'd run faster, they probably wouldn't, because we may have already selected that that person's
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.240]   thriving on carbohydrate. What I would be interested in is like, you have, let's say we
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:56.640]   have someone with equal talent, but got weeded out along the way, potentially because for whatever
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.480]   reason, they just weren't able to tolerate like the both the training and the nutrition requirements
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:03.840]   that they're being told to do. So the coaches can, there's a culture where the coaches would
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:10.080]   really push a carb heavy diet, and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:16.240]   that are not, it would filter out to people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:20.400]   training. I mean, I might be an example of this actually, where, you know, you take someone where
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.960]   they, for whatever reason, the carbs aren't working for them, like it's unsustainable for
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.320]   them to continue that path, or if they do, they might have a shortened career. So they might be
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.880]   able to eke out a few really good years, but then, you know, they're not gonna be the person
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.960]   they're like, wow, that person's 38 and they're still competing at the Olympics type of a person.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.440]   And, you know, you put them on a low carb diet. If you can control everything else,
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.200]   like their entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then, you know, they may
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:54.960]   still have better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level. But if that's
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.440]   not gonna be sustainable for them as a person, then, you know, what's the point kind of at that,
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.280]   unless they wanna be like a kind of a spark in the pan, so to speak.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.320]   - I just feel good eating meat performance-wise.
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:12.400]   - Well, I think there's that group too. They may just not be the Olympians.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:18.000]   - Yeah, and so we're not talking, I guess this conversation has several layers. One is for the
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:27.920]   Olympics and one is for like, what is it? Active athletes, they're like amateurs, whatever category
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:34.000]   I put myself into, like people that exercise regularly. And then maybe people, and then
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:41.120]   there's people who like exercise rarely. So on all of those fronts, I mean, do you think it's
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:47.840]   possible to live a happy, active life eating meat only or mostly meat?
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.640]   - Yeah.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.000]   - What have you learned about this?
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.040]   - Yeah, I think so for some context, like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.720]   diet for the last 10 years. And just like kind of the training, I'd periodize it to a degree where
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.640]   there are parts of my training where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate. And there's
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.160]   periods of my training, especially like the off season where I'm like very low and I might be like
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:14.400]   kind of in that ballpark of like ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates for periods of time.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.640]   - And what kind of food are we talking about? What's a strict low carb diet?
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.280]   - I've ranged everywhere from like mostly plant-based low carb keto to like mostly animal
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:29.520]   based. I've very rarely gone much more than like two weeks strict where it's like I'm strict
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.640]   carnivore or strict plant-based or anything like that. Like we're talking probably more like 95%
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:43.440]   at the peak in terms of any type of like longer lasting. From my personal experience of like being
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:50.000]   like either in like the animal food camp or like the plant-based camp kind of a process. So I've
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.760]   tried all of them, things have stayed consistent over the 10 years as a kind of the macronutrient
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.920]   profile that I've done throughout the course of-
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.960]   - So one didn't win over the other in terms of meat-based versus plant-based?
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:04.560]   - Oh, for me, meat-based definitely. I mean, I was my highest meat consumption in 2019 and that
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.840]   was by far my best racing season.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.000]   - Yeah, we keep coming back to that year. That was a good year for many reasons,
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.520]   philosophically and nutritionally.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.440]   - Yeah, only 2020 happened and now I haven't had a really good chance to replicate it.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.400]   - To improve, yeah.
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.000]   - We'll see, hopefully I've got some more in the tank.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:27.040]   - That's strange, most athletes that compete at your level have more carbs integrated into their
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.520]   diets. So what have you learned about using meat in a high performance?
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:37.280]   - I think it's maybe less about the meat and it's more about like, what is it replacing?
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:45.120]   So if we step away from like me specifically and just like the people that, 'cause I mean,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.880]   we're getting to the point where I get it's anecdotes, but like that's what we have at
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.800]   the moment 'cause there's, I mean, there is actually a study being done on like, I think,
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:57.360]   I guess they call it hyper carnivore where they're like, I think above 80% of their intake from meat.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.160]   - Into meat.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.880]   - And they're looking at a few different things there, but.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.680]   - It's so weird and I keep interrupting, but it's so weird that it sounds unhealthy,
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.520]   hyper carnivore.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:07.920]   - Yeah.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.440]   - But it makes me feel really good.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.160]   - It's the individual thing, right?
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.360]   - Yeah, it's the individual thing.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.040]   - There's countless people now who like, and I'm not saying that they could not have found
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:23.760]   another route, myself included, like in 2011, when I switched from moderate to high carbohydrate to
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.200]   low carbohydrate and saw some very noticeable differences in the way I felt, the way I
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.680]   performed in all this stuff, that doesn't mean that there wasn't another path.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.120]   I just did not find that path.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.240]   And the fact that I found a path that was producing the results I was looking for is
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.680]   really all that matters in my mind.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:47.600]   You know, like I don't really care if there was a parallel path that works just as well, or
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.680]   you know, something like that, because ultimately we only have one shot at everything we're doing.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.720]   So like, it'd be great if I could go back and try four or five different things.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.040]   - Well, the annoying thing is that the body adjusts to whatever the heck you're doing,
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.520]   so it's hard to do good science even on yourself.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.600]   - Yeah, I've referenced my 2019 racing season a few times, and it's like, it'd be silly for me
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.840]   to put all of the emphasis on my nutrition plan for that, because it also comes with
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.160]   two decades of endurance training.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.400]   So it's possible, and it's very likely that a huge portion of that success was just the
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.440]   culmination of a lot of work over time from the training side of things.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.920]   I just think like, anytime you hyper focus on one area, or pick a couple variables and just
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.040]   target those, you find yourself in a position where you're putting other things in the most
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.320]   uncharitable light possible.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:40.160]   So then you have this situation where like, it's actually a combination of a variety of
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:42.400]   different things, so where are the big movers?
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.080]   And for me, nutritional shift was pretty clear that that improved my sleep and my recovery.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.920]   And I mean, people can say, well, there's the placebo effect, which is a very real concern.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:59.280]   But for me personally, a 10-year placebo effect would be a quite lengthy placebo effect.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.800]   And I do think it's individual, though I emphasize that a lot, because I mean, I've worked with tons
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.240]   of people with this, and I do see a range from person to person.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:13.520]   I've worked with people who come to me, and they're like strict keto, and we raise up their
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:15.040]   carbohydrates a bit.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.680]   And they're like, OK, I feel way better doing it this way.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:21.680]   And I've worked with people who they come to me, moderate carbohydrate, but they're interested
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:22.000]   enough.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.640]   They want to try a lower carb, so we titrate them down.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.880]   And I've had clients where I'm like, OK, I'm going to give them this workout, and they're
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.200]   going to wish they brought back a little bit of carbohydrate.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.760]   And then they go and they nail the workout, and I'm just like baffled.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.600]   Because they're different from me.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:44.000]   And every time when you have your own personal experience, the first guttural response is,
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.440]   oh, if I had done it, it would have gone this way.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.520]   Why did it go the complete opposite way for them?
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.080]   And you have to just step out of your own perspective a bit and say, OK, well, they're
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:52.400]   different.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.000]   For whatever reason, they're getting along like this.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:03.200]   I've had several moments in my life where you realize the body is weird, and it's weirder
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:04.880]   than the average advice.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.080]   One of them is how well I perform for my own standards when I fast.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.920]   First of all, intellectually, but that's more known and understandable.
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:22.480]   But physically, the fact that I could train, not eat 20 hours, 24 hours, and then do a
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:29.680]   hard jiu-jitsu session for two hours, hard, it's incredible to me.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.800]   This makes no sense.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.280]   Because I used to eat many times a day.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.440]   Of course, you have to eat.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:38.320]   You don't want to eat too close to the training session, was my thinking.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.480]   But you definitely need to load up on carbs three hours before in order to have enough
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.120]   energy.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:51.200]   The fact that I could not eat and have incredible focus, but also athleticism, both endurance
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.080]   and explosive.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.240]   Jiu-jitsu is a special thing.
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:55.760]   It's more like chess.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.120]   It's not like powerlifting.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.160]   No, not powerlifting.
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:01.440]   Olympic lifting, where it's like true explosiveness.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.040]   But that's fascinating.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.960]   And it makes you wonder, what other things are there to discover about yourself?
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:11.600]   The annoying thing about food is it's delicious.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.960]   So it's hard to do good science on yourself.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:24.400]   For two weeks or a month to do strict no carbs, and then maybe next month you add 20 grams
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.120]   or 40 grams of carbs and see how you actually feel.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.960]   Not in that moment, but over a period of several weeks.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:36.800]   And then doing everything else right based on best available science, like with electrolytes
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.840]   and the vitamins.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:42.880]   But then also remove all the humans from your life that affect you positively or negatively,
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.080]   because you might feel amazing because you're hanging out with cool people.
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:49.600]   And then removing basically all the variables.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.280]   It's fascinating.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.560]   And you all of us land in a place where we find something that worked for us.
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:01.280]   And then we maybe use some of the placebo effect to help us out to stick in that place.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.320]   And then I suppose that's the way to live life.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:07.760]   It's possible to find the optimal for any of us.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:15.280]   But carnivore is an interesting new kind of caveat, a new challenge to the nutritional
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.920]   community, because more and more people seem to be doing well under carnivore.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:24.720]   Well, the nutrition community is probably like, we just got done dealing with the vegans.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.600]   Now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:35.920]   But I think-- well, I mean, what this all tells me is there is, for one, in our food
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.920]   environment, the failure rate of any one approach at a population level is going to be incredibly
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:42.560]   high.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.680]   It's why we have-- what is it, like 88% of the population has some sort of metabolic
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:48.640]   syndrome.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.280]   And it's because there's an endless quantity of everything that you can get your hands
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.320]   on for relatively cheap.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:02.480]   And I think that presents a problem if your mindset is going to be, we need this set of
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.800]   parameters for nutrition, and everyone needs to adhere to that, or you're wrong.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:12.880]   And it's like, well, tell that to the person who went carnivore and cleared up some crazy
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.560]   skin ailment or something like that.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.520]   That's a weird one.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.400]   Like where the carnivore seems to treat depression.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.560]   Like mental stuff.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.200]   It's fascinating.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.320]   There's all these stories.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.400]   Again, it's anecdotes, but it's like--
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.360]   The mental one, I think, may-- I'm stepping out a bit on a limb here.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.640]   But I want to say some of the research of Dominic D'Agostino and Jeff Volokh was looking
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:43.440]   at the ketogenic diet, which a carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic--
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.880]   I mean, you could always go way too high on the protein, I guess.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.480]   But most people that I see doing carnivore, they're cognizant enough that-- at least if
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:57.440]   they're doing it for therapeutic reasons, they're not going 50% protein, 50%-- they're
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.640]   more like 70/30, 80/20, something like that.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:07.840]   And I think you do see some work with the brain and some of the mental stuff.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.760]   I know some of the-- I'm not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that Dr. Dominic
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:18.320]   D'Agostino had, where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post-traumatic
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.000]   stress disorder, and that sort of stuff with a strict ketogenic diet.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.400]   So I wonder if some of that, like the depression-related stuff, has to do with that, where now their
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:29.440]   body is just fueling their brain differently than maybe they were in the past.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:32.880]   But that's just wild guesses on my part.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:35.200]   And I'm deviating from the conversation.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:35.360]   But--
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:36.800]   - No, that's brilliant.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.640]   In terms of your own story on food, can you say something-- I think we were kind of referring
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.160]   to diet broadly.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:51.520]   Can you say something about how you like to fuel your-- whether it's race or great training
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:58.800]   sessions, like maybe the day before, let's go even that far, during, and maybe a few
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.440]   hours after?
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.480]   - OK.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:05.680]   It'll be a little different for racing than it will be for a big workout, just because
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.280]   the interesting thing about ultra running is just you never do the race even-- like
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.040]   most endurance races, you're going to cover the distance.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.280]   You're going to replicate the race almost up to it in training, whereas with 100 miles--
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.480]   - You can't.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.000]   - You might replicate a third of it.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:23.360]   So I'll walk you through kind of my approach for a 100 mile race, and I can tell you maybe
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.200]   what I would do differently on a training day.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:33.520]   But yeah, so where the community is in agreement is that you do want to be very good at burning
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.640]   fat for ultra marathons.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.240]   I mean, the intensity is low.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:44.880]   If your ratios are skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you're going
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.320]   to have to defend your muscle glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.320]   And that's just going to be very hard to do over the course of an entire day, even at
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.200]   low intensities.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.280]   So it's a fuel tank thing.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:01.200]   I mean, it's like your leanest endurance athletes have way more fat than the new glycogen stores.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.440]   When you're doing low intensity performance, you want to be burning high levels of fat
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.120]   and sparing that muscle glycogen.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.400]   What I tend to do is I want to start the race burning really high levels of fat.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.960]   So I'll maybe have some carbohydrate the night before for dinner, but then I'm going to lean
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:19.840]   into the overnight fast, breakfast the morning of.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.560]   I'm going to stay away from carbohydrates for 100 mile or anyway, and I'm going to have
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:31.280]   something that's pretty high energy, low volume.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:33.840]   So I'll do an S fuels life bar.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.360]   They've got like--
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.440]   What's in an S fuel life bar?
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.560]   Are we talking about carbs?
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:39.840]   Are we talking about protein?
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:41.040]   It's basically fat and protein.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:41.600]   Fat and protein.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.040]   Yeah, fat protein bar.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:43.760]   And then they make some--
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:44.480]   That's awesome.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.120]   So it's not as low carb.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:47.680]   Yep.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:52.240]   Yeah, they make-- S fuels makes a whole product line that's like kind of positioned for a
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.600]   low carb athlete.
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.080]   So they have some products on their lineup that offer some carbohydrate, which is perfect
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:01.840]   for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on racing and some of my bigger training sessions
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:02.560]   and things.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:05.840]   But the majority of their products are low carb.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:10.000]   So like they have like, you know, how you get like the powders that you put into like
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.520]   your drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.640]   They make a version of that that's like fat based.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.040]   Oh, cool.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.480]   Then you can mix in with water?
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.120]   Yep.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:19.440]   Cool.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.240]   So they've got like a creamer version and then a fruity flavor version.
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:25.520]   So you can like replicate the taste and the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.240]   sports drink.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.200]   Science is awesome.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.080]   I know it is.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.720]   Well, and that's so much of it too, because people are always like, "I don't know.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:32.720]   I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever."
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:33.680]   Right, yeah.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.800]   It's like, well, you can have it now.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:35.920]   Just it won't have all the carbs.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:37.680]   And you can see you can bring that kind of thing with you.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:43.600]   So I'm leaning on a lot of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume,
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:47.440]   high energy fat protein stuff the morning of so that when I start the race, my body
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:50.160]   is gonna be encouraged to start out burning high levels of fat.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:55.840]   Once I get going, probably about 45 minutes in, I'll start introducing small amounts of
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:56.640]   carbohydrate.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.720]   So at that point, my body's been revving pretty high fat metabolism.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:06.880]   And by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let's say my 100
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:12.800]   mile personal record, you know, I'm running approximately nine miles every hour.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:16.080]   So I'm probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour's time.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:22.960]   I'm gonna start just like defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.320]   At the heart rate I would do for that, I'm probably burning somewhere between 80, 90%
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.120]   fat.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.760]   You know, 12 hours of that, you can chip away at your muscle glycogen to the point where
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.920]   you don't necessarily want to go zero carb.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.480]   So I'm basically just trying to defend what I know I'm gonna be burning from the carbohydrate
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:45.120]   side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like, usually, you know, I've
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   gone as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.840]   And the reality is somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40 I can get
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:55.920]   away without any digestion issues.
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:00.960]   So I'm not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since I'm only concerned
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.920]   about performance on that day.
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:04.080]   - Is it the carbs that's the problem or is it fiber?
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.800]   - Oh, from going above 40 grams?
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.120]   - Or just, 'cause you mentioned digestion issues.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:14.640]   Like one of the things for me, like one of the cool things about fatty protein, protein
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.360]   and fat is like my stomach just feels way better.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.640]   So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:26.640]   - Yeah, and I think the funny thing is like, if you look at the position paper for ultra
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:31.280]   marathon single day events and it's, you know, it's very limited in the sense that it's not
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.320]   anyone's fault, it's just that we don't have a lot of great research on 100 mile race.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.320]   It's really hard to study what's going on when someone's running 100 miles, but they'll
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.760]   say moderate carbohydrate diet is recommended, but they'll also say that it's like something
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.440]   like 60% of participants are gonna report some sort of like digestion issue during the
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:47.760]   event.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:51.200]   So then it kind of becomes an issue of do you wanna flip that coin?
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.160]   Do you wanna flip that coin?
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:52.880]   - Yeah, it'd be the 40%.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.080]   - Right, exactly.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:00.960]   So for me, what I found is like, I can push up to 40 grams without getting any digestion
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:01.360]   issues.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.920]   Do I need 40 grams?
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:10.640]   Probably not, at least not based on kind of the numbers that would be like, that I would
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:14.160]   see on like, if I went and actually got like a metabolic heart test or something like that.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:18.160]   But it's possible, I mean, if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:18.880]   that per hour.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.360]   Most folks that are following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are gonna be recommended
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:26.480]   to do like 50 to 70 grams during a single day ultra marathon events.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:32.400]   And you'll see some, you know, some recommendations of up to like 100 grams, not so much for ultra
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.720]   marathons, but just in general for like a performance standpoint, which I mean, it's
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.360]   one of those things where it's like application versus like what you can do in a lab for one
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.880]   hour is gonna be a lot different, especially when you're stretching out distances well
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.440]   past that.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:50.800]   And there's, I'm diverting a little here, but I mean, there's like an approach of like
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:55.040]   training your gut so you can like be able to tolerate that much carbohydrate, which
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:58.800]   you can do and you may have to if you're gonna follow a high carbohydrate diet.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:04.080]   But again, we go back to that practicality standpoint of if you're a professional Olympian,
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:09.040]   who's living and breathing performance, and you're burning two to three times your
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:16.000]   resting metabolic rate on some days, like you, you may be able to actually consume 100
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.640]   grams of carbohydrate per hour during your training sessions and just, you know, barely
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.560]   stay on top of your nutritional needs.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.320]   Most people who are running ultra marathons aren't gonna be, you know, probably training
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.680]   much past 10 hours per week.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:35.200]   And they're probably not gonna have the, I'll call it their dietary budget to tolerate 100
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:39.760]   grams of carbohydrate consumption during their workouts and still be able to stay healthy.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.520]   And, you know, so I think that's kind of like a bit of a, of a non, a non starter for the
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:50.560]   majority of people, unless we want to talk about like a tiny percentage of the 1% of
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.360]   top performers.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.200]   So maybe you can talk about the training, like fueling yourself during training as well.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:01.120]   Is there, and also as part of that, is it possible to train mostly fasted?
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:09.920]   Because as a side comment, let me just say, I like, again, not anywhere, not even like
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.880]   one 10th of your level of performance, but you know, I try to push myself and I just
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.320]   feel much better when I'm fasted.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:22.560]   So water and maybe some salt for longer runs for anything over like 10, 15 miles, but no
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:22.880]   food.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.680]   Yeah, I think, I mean, I like to train on an empty stomach.
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.960]   I do most of my, my biggest training session usually in the morning.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.400]   And it usually, what will determine whether I eat something or not before that is like,
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:35.040]   how much do I need to eat that day in order to stay on top of it to be able to train again
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:35.520]   the next day.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.320]   So I'll, I'll usually do something similar to what I do before a race if I need to kind
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:41.920]   of stay on top of calories for the day.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:48.080]   So I'm not like at noon with like no calorie intake and like 5,000 calories to try to consume
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:50.960]   before I go to bed that night and get out and do the same thing the next day.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:57.840]   But yeah, I think if I were, if I were doing what you're doing, like if that were my
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:01.680]   lifestyle, I think I would do almost all my runs fasted.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:07.120]   I don't see why I would be eating a lot before it because it's like, I'm just introducing
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.200]   something that could, especially if you're noticing, like, here's what I'd say.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.240]   If I was doing that and I was like, wow, this run sucks.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.680]   And then I introduced something beforehand and now my run was feeling great and my progress
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.720]   was getting better.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.720]   That's when I would maybe consider having something before.
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:25.040]   But if you're running both of those, those like self experiments, you're noticing, yeah,
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:28.720]   if I eat something before I go on this workout, the workout's less enjoyable.
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.000]   I'm not noticing any, any increased improvements on it.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.040]   Again, it's a little messy.
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:36.160]   Like we said before, it's hard to really, you can't go back and try it a different way
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.200]   on that specific day.
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:42.880]   But I think, I think most people, if they're just like, they go at it with like no bias
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:47.360]   in the sense that they're like trying to make one work versus the other, you can get at
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:48.720]   least a good enough look at it.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:56.000]   And if absolute peak performance in one activity, one very specific activity isn't your goal,
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.960]   then it's like, do you really care if one has a 2% performance increase that you won't
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:01.680]   even probably notice?
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:06.320]   Because there's other variables that will clearly overpower that 2% one way or the other.
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:11.760]   - And there's some benefit in terms of freedom and letting go of like having to think about
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.720]   some of these variables.
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:18.400]   I see sort of fasting is, even if it's like a hit on the performance, it's worth it to
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.680]   just not think about it.
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:26.160]   There's some really nice aspect to just putting on shoes, not caring, like what shorts you
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:30.560]   wear or like what your outfit is like, not being optimal in every way and just not caring
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:35.200]   and just enjoying the purity of just running no matter what.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:36.960]   Just enjoying the natural aspect.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:41.760]   - Yeah, there's a side to me that sometimes just like craves a lifestyle where it's like,
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:48.720]   I have like such a small house and only what I need and just like a handful of food products
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:52.080]   I know I enjoy and work well for me and I don't even have the distraction of the other
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:52.400]   stuff.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:58.240]   There's almost like a weight that comes off your shoulders when you think, even just thinking
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:59.680]   about it, like it's so simple.
[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:04.320]   - So the reason I'm mostly a minimalist like that, the reason I have stuff is I realized
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:09.200]   like you probably have to fit into society and if you want to have other people in your
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:11.040]   life, you should probably get used to having stuff.
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.840]   Because most people like stuff.
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:16.800]   - Right, yeah, well, yeah, there's that side of it too.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:20.880]   And there's a whole, you don't want to ostracize yourself too much.
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:24.880]   And I think anything you can kind of like, you can manipulate that a little bit where
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:30.720]   there's things that are like not specific to, that's going to negatively impact the
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:32.960]   people around you or your experiences with them.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.600]   So there's a balance like everything, I guess.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.520]   - Yeah, I mean, that's why I drink, I think I mentioned to you offline, drink vodka, whiskey,
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:47.920]   sort of alcohol, because I don't feel good about it the day after or sometimes multiple
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:48.560]   days after.
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.560]   So I know it's not good for me.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.560]   So I do a lot of stuff that's good for me, everything we talked about, exercise and diet
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.840]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:02.480]   But the alcohol almost symbolizes embracing the chaos of life, the wild and the amazing
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:03.600]   things that could happen.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.480]   And I think that's really important because if you optimize everything about life, then
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:12.080]   you're going to miss most of the fun stuff that happens in life.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.560]   So it's not all about the optimization.
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:20.800]   It's some of it, like everyone has different things and how they introduce that chaos in
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:21.920]   a controlled way.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.000]   For me, alcohol is that, because I'm okay drinking, not too much.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.600]   So I can control that aspect, even though it's unhealthy, it introduces just the right
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.240]   amount of fun.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:33.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:34.720]   I embrace it.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:34.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.320]   And I mean, it is one of those things where it's like, I'm going to benefit now and pay
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:43.280]   later a little bit too, where like, and hey, if you go and you go out with some friends
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.880]   and drink and you have memories that last a lifetime from that experience and you paid
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:52.320]   for it for a couple of days after, then hey, maybe that's a fair trade off from a life
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:52.800]   experience.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:55.920]   And part of the vodka thing is I need to honor my ancestors.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:03.600]   It's like you have to, you know, you can't, you can't turn your back on your past.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.040]   Let me ask about the hundred mile world record on the treadmill.
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:12.960]   So for most people running on a treadmill is really boring.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.480]   So that's kind of their experience of it.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.440]   That's probably the first thing that would say that seems like really boring to run a
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:20.640]   hundred miles on a treadmill.
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.960]   Would you say it's boring?
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.280]   Like what were some places your mind went to make that happen?
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:33.920]   So this one is interesting to me because I definitely recognized the boredom and the
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:34.400]   difference.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:39.440]   The thing that the question I can't quite answer, I think with it is like, could I have
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.360]   remedied that with better preparation?
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.240]   Because the scenario that put me on a treadmill for a hundred miles was, you know, it was
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:51.040]   March, 2020, basically the cascade of every race on the planet got canceled.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:57.360]   And I was in a position where I was going to be doing a runnable hundred miler on a
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.240]   track in mid to late April.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:02.560]   So I had like the majority of my training under my belt.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:05.280]   So I was like kind of putting the finishing touches on that.
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.960]   And I was like, oh, great, here we are.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.360]   Like, you know, what do I do with this fitness?
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.080]   Do I just scale back and hope the events come back in the fall and then peak again?
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.720]   Or do I find something to use this fitness for?
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.800]   And the treadmill was the closest thing to what I had been training for in terms of just
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:24.880]   like a mechanical, like flat running, essentially, that I could think of.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:32.160]   And my thought was, OK, well, I'll just live stream myself on a treadmill and see what
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:32.480]   happens.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.800]   It ended up turning into like a quite a big event.
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.280]   But you don't usually incorporate treadmill running into your running into your training.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.040]   I don't not incorporate it.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.320]   I just don't incorporate it in the way that would be necessarily conducive to, you know,
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:49.760]   dealing with the mental aspects of being on a treadmill for a hundred miles.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.080]   Was it that different than running on a track?
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.760]   It was from the sense that here's the way I describe it is when I'm on a track, it's
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.200]   a controlled environment and everything can be very uniform.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:06.240]   But there are tiny little micro adjustments and pace that that I'm doing subconsciously
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.920]   that give me the sense of control.
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:08.160]   Right.
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.280]   You know, I might run the exact same split, but there's like a fraction of a second or,
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:15.920]   you know, a fraction of a second faster than a fraction of a second slower that equals
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:16.960]   the same outcome.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.160]   It gives you that sense of control.
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:21.040]   You're determining how fast you're going on a treadmill.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:22.960]   You're responding to the belt.
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.680]   So the advantage is you can set a pace and know you're hitting it.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:29.760]   The disadvantage is you're being told what to do by that machine.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.120]   And that gets very frustrating.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:35.760]   I felt like I wanted to step off like you get to like certain points where you're just
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:38.640]   like, like even stepping off what I noticed.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.680]   I learned this on the day of actually I noticed there's something where it didn't really
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.880]   matter how long I get off.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:45.920]   Like I get off to use the bathroom and that was a little bit of a longer break.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:52.720]   Then I had like a hiccup during my event where we ran so much power through one end of the
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:55.520]   house that the screen on the treadmill was blacking out.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:00.320]   So we ended up, so I ended up jumping back and forth on treadmills for quite a bit in
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:00.960]   the beginning.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.400]   And I noticed even turning it off, stepping on the other one and starting the other one
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.280]   up gave me like, you know, a handful of seconds between was enough of a mental break of just
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:12.480]   like that release of being told what to do to reset.
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:16.960]   So maybe if you were in the future, you would figure out what exactly how much is needed
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:18.160]   to have that method.
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:22.400]   I never actually thought about that, that, I mean, obviously for you, but also for people
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:26.960]   like me, like amateur runners, that that's a source of frustration with the treadmill,
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:33.360]   that there's sometimes a small adjustments in pace that we do running, not on the treadmill
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:39.360]   on the ground that feel like essential for that feel, just like you said, that experience
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:45.280]   of control, like feeling like you're in control somehow that's really, I don't know, that's
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.960]   somehow liberating in the way that a treadmill can be just the source of frustration.
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:54.560]   - The funny thing though, about the treadmill is I actually like to do faster workouts on
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:06:00.240]   the treadmill, like long intervals or something like that, or tempo runs, because for that,
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:04.720]   for that type of stuff, sometimes for those, I want to release the brain power required
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:06.560]   to hit that pace and say, you take care of that.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.400]   And for that, it's fun, but those are over quick, so you don't really run into the times.
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:14.560]   - Yeah, that's fascinating for like precise control of pace.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:19.680]   You've also during that stream got to interact with one of the greatest athletes of all time,
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:20.400]   Bert Kreischer.
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:24.320]   What's your, he's actually doing, I don't know if you're paying attention to this, but
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:26.880]   I guess he has a goal of running 2000 miles this year.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.280]   - Yeah.
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:34.480]   - I've gotten a chance to talk to Joe Rogan yesterday about this, which is fascinating.
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:40.720]   I think he's a little bit doubtful of Bert's ability to be the ultra performer that he
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.600]   so naturally is.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.000]   - Yeah.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:45.520]   - What's your thoughts about Bert as a runner?
[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:46.880]   What's your advice to him?
[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:50.720]   And what was your interaction like as part of this treadmill challenge with him?
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:54.800]   - I love Bert because he's such a nice person.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:07:01.040]   I mean, as a guy who's just accelerated in popularity over the last few years, he is
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.240]   super kind.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:08.240]   So for folks who are curious, I've met Bert a couple of years earlier and I just randomly
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:10.640]   asked him, "Hey, I'm doing this live stream thing.
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:12.080]   We're doing it for Fight for the Forgotten.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:13.760]   We're trying to raise some funds for them.
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:16.160]   Would you want to come on the live stream for a bit?"
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.880]   And I thought maybe he'd come off like five or 10 minutes.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.480]   And I thought that'd be amazing if he did that.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:21.920]   He ended up coming off like over an hour.
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:25.680]   He said he went past his slot, sat in the next slot and just started talking with some
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:26.560]   of the other guests.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:34.720]   He's just-- Bert is definitely-- I feel like he's as unchanged from his popularity as one
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:35.600]   can get away with.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:44.480]   And it's just like his lifestyle, I think, is very unpredictable in the sense that if
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:50.480]   he wants to run X time for a specific race, that's going to pull away from his lifestyle
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:52.000]   so much to focus on that.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.640]   Luckily for him, he's actually a great athlete.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:56.880]   It's under that layer of--
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:58.240]   Of fat, yeah.
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.880]   So for people who are not familiar, Bert Kresher is a comedian who takes off his shirt often,
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:07.440]   has a elegant layer of fat around him.
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:08.640]   He's also a party animal.
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:12.640]   So he's a weird balance of healthy and unhealthy.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:19.760]   So he drinks a lot during-- I think there's some debate about that-- but certainly after
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:21.680]   his performances.
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:25.520]   But at the same time, he's into kind of the running thing.
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:27.680]   And he does quite a bit of treadmill running, I think.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.400]   And like I said, has this challenge of running 2,000 miles this year.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:38.240]   So it's fascinating to have somebody who so fully embraces life and the full joys of life
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:43.440]   as represented by the huge amounts of drinking and partying and just being a wild man.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:50.400]   But also at the same time, being at least curious about this challenging yourself in
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.520]   the physical realm.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:52.560]   It's kind of fascinating.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:58.640]   It reminds me of one of my favorite comedians, like Eddie Izzard, who has been doing those
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:03.920]   challenges basically off the couch, just running a marathon a day kind of thing.
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:11.280]   It's fascinating to see the purity of those challenges when exercise hasn't necessarily
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:14.640]   been deeply ingrained in your life.
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:18.240]   And you kind of just embrace the challenge anyway and take it on.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:20.080]   And that's another way of looking at it.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:26.240]   Because we've been talking about running as a performance optimization thing where training
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.880]   is such a huge part of this process.
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.720]   Like race day is just the cherry on top.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.400]   But there's for some people where the race is the cake.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:34.960]   - Yeah.
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:40.240]   - It's like they just take it on as a pure challenge, as the thing you haven't really
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:45.040]   trained for, as the thing you don't understand the intricacies of, but you take it on anyway.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.760]   And that reveals something about the human spirit as well.
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.560]   - Yeah.
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:52.560]   And there's definitely like a switch that flips when you in your mind decide I'm going
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.360]   to do this.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:57.200]   Where then all of a sudden it goes from like you stop thinking about, oh, that's not possible
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.320]   to like, well, I'm just going to do it.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:03.760]   And I think Bert highlights that perfectly in a lot of cases where like he's maybe not
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.040]   even thinking it through enough to get to the point where it's like he gets the point
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:08.560]   where he thinks this is not possible.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:11.920]   Where most people would look at it and think, huh, I don't know if I can actually physically
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.200]   accomplish that task.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.360]   Bert's just like, oh, yeah, I'm going to do it.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:19.520]   And my thought with Bert was the 2000 mile thing is where are we going to find him at
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.720]   the end of the year with like 36 hours to go on a hundred miles?
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:23.760]   - That's right.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.320]   That's right.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:25.360]   That's what's going to happen.
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:28.720]   And it's going to be hilarious.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:34.640]   So speaking of things that are insane and like taking on challenges that don't seem
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:44.480]   like you didn't think through, you're thinking about running across the country in a challenge
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.880]   you call the transcontinental run.
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.440]   Can you describe this challenge and what the heck you're thinking?
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.320]   - Yeah.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:50.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:55.680]   So this is, you know, one thing that is exciting about ultra marathons, I think in a lot of
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:00.080]   places, especially early in someone's ultra marathon adventure, if they decide to do that
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:04.640]   as a part of their life is you have like these early years where you're doing things for
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:09.760]   the first time and it's like so cool and scary at the same time to think today I'm going
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:13.600]   to run a hundred miles and the furthest I've ever run before is 50 or something like that.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:16.240]   And you just know you're going to do something that you've never done before.
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:18.560]   You're going to experience things you would have never been able to predict.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.640]   And it's like this really interesting, unique, like human experience, I think.
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.520]   So for me, I've spent most of my career at this point, like doing, I got through that
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.440]   phase and a lot of the events I'm really interested in.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:34.960]   And then it was like, now let's repeat it and see if we can do it better.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.200]   And you get into that mindset for a while, which is also a fun mindset, but there is
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:44.720]   that kind of like desire to kind of have that human experience again of like, you know,
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.360]   not knowing what could happen or is this doable type of a thing, but still doing it and figuring
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.320]   it out along the way.
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.960]   So I would describe the Transcontinental Project as something like that.
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.280]   It's not anything unique to me or anything new.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.960]   There's been a lot of people who've done it before, but essentially it's a route.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:11:59.760]   There's different routes.
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:03.920]   There's one kind of main one that's done for like, that is used as the record route,
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.400]   more or less, that you go from San Francisco to New York and essentially you live out of
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.480]   an RV while you're running.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:14.160]   So you run as much as you can during the day, then you go to bed at night and then you get
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:14.880]   up and do it again.
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:21.600]   And you're handling all the logistics in the process of trying to make sure you can get
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:24.560]   up the next day and do again what you did the day before, which is going to be the biggest
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:25.040]   difference.
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.000]   So for me, I've done all single day ultra marathons where you're going to wring yourself
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.720]   dry at knowing the next day or week or however long you need, you're going to be able to
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:37.040]   just kind of like shut everything down and let everything catch back up.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:40.560]   Whereas with this, you're doing it again and again, again.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:45.280]   And the record is by a guy named Pete Kostelnik who averaged just over 72 miles a day,
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.600]   finished in 42 days, six hours and 30 minutes.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.960]   And I mean, just like 72 miles, 73 miles.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.520]   And then like next day again, next day again, just knowing every day when you finish, you
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.600]   spend a whole day running and then, okay, I'm going to go to bed.
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:58.400]   I'm going to wake up in the morning.
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:12:59.360]   I'm going to have to do this again.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:02.480]   And then have that happen for six weeks.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.000]   And that's if it goes very well.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.640]   So luck, I assume, is a big part of this.
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:07.200]   Yeah, for sure.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.960]   I mean, there's just so many variables that are uncontrollable on this type of an experience,
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:13.840]   just because I mean, you go over the Sierras, maybe you hit a storm.
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:14.960]   You know, you try to time it.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.520]   Most people do it in September, start in September.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:21.760]   So you can get over the mountain passes without a big storm coming through.
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.160]   But then also get to the East Coast before it's like the middle of winter.
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:29.440]   So like September, early September start is kind of ideal.
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.960]   But you can, you know, I mean, Pete was very fortunate from a weather standpoint.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.320]   I think he made one big mistake.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.600]   We got a little too aggressive in the beginning.
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:36.640]   I had to take a full day off.
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.800]   So he actually averaged from a moving day standpoint, closer to 75 miles per day.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:46.160]   But yeah, I mean, there's going to be things that I can't prepare for, won't know it's
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:46.640]   going to happen.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.800]   You know, a lot of that will get a lot of the logistical stuff will get leaned on with
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:51.680]   the crew.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.600]   So that's I mean, that's the hardest part right now is just like getting all that put
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.640]   together where it's like, OK, I need to have the RV ready.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:13:59.600]   I need to have all the stuff.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:02.240]   I mean, we need to have the places figured out where we're going to stop.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:08.000]   And and the people that can dedicate that much time to an activity like that, you know,
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.040]   there's a lot of moving parts even before you start the adventure itself.
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:11.600]   When are you?
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:14.160]   So you're taking the San Francisco to New York?
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:14.640]   Yeah.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.640]   And when are you doing the run?
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.640]   September 1st is when, you know, barring anything like catastrophic between now and
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:20.800]   then.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:22.960]   It's really exciting, but I mean, it's incredible.
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.480]   So you'll probably have a bunch of people just randomly running with you.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.280]   Are people going to be tracking where you're located?
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.360]   Yeah, so I'll be documenting everything because I mean, my hope is that I'm doing it primarily
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:36.000]   to raise awareness for Fight for the Forgotten, Justin Wren's charity.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:43.360]   But with that said, I think I am capable of if I have a good experience, you know, chasing
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:46.720]   the record or going after the record or at least getting close to it.
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:46.960]   So.
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:47.520]   Oh shit.
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:49.680]   So you're going to try to beat this record?
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.840]   Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to go out with the I'm going to structure the process in
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.560]   a way that leaves that door open is the way I would describe it.
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:02.240]   I'm going to try not to do anything that would potentially put it in a situation where
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.240]   that becomes the primary goal, just because I want to make sure that the reason I decided
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.400]   to do the first place was for Fight for the Forgotten.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:12.480]   So I want to make sure that I don't end up two thirds way across the country with a broken
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.960]   leg and I'm like, hey guys, I guess the donation buttons turned off.
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:20.800]   So focus on like, don't sacrifice that.
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:21.440]   Right.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.080]   That goal.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:28.240]   But also there's a community aspect to it that I feel like are you going to I mean,
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:30.400]   so you're going to document and post.
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:35.120]   But are you going to also is there a safety perspective here?
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:36.640]   It's like the Forrest Gump thing.
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:40.640]   You might have large numbers of crowds that run along with you for a while.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:41.440]   Yeah.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.040]   Worried about that kind of thing?
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:46.400]   I wouldn't say I'm worried about I mean, I think there's probably there's remote enough
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.040]   spots along the way where you'll get some alone time or more likely I don't necessarily
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:55.280]   mind if people want to jump in there'll be some people that will definitely want to do
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.720]   that and they can come in.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.200]   And but the reality is like, it's probably not going to be a scenario where there's like,
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:03.600]   you know, 40 people following me at all times.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:05.200]   You say that now.
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:05.680]   Yeah.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:06.560]   You never know.
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:07.520]   Just wait for this podcast.
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:08.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.600]   And then if Joe finds out you're doing this, then we're in trouble.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:13.120]   All right.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:17.680]   So I mean, what are the things that you think will be the hardest for you?
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:20.000]   And also like, how do you train for this kind of thing?
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.960]   And what are the hardest things you anticipate?
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.320]   How do you train for them?
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:26.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:30.880]   So the way I'm looking at this is it's much less about performance from the traditional
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:34.880]   sense where I need to be able to be X fit.
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:37.440]   I think I need to be injury proof.
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:40.080]   That's what's going to be a detriment.
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.440]   If you think about it, like, if I managed to average nine minute mile pace for a day,
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:49.360]   that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time frame.
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:52.640]   So I'll easily have 12 hours of moving time per day.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:57.760]   Nine minute pace, I think, is slow enough that it's not an unreasonable clip.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.640]   So like when you, I mean, obviously there's things that slow you down or I'll probably
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.720]   take walking breaks, you know, stopping breaks.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:06.400]   You got to stay on top of nutrition.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:07.440]   That's the other big thing too.
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.760]   I'm probably eating like anywhere between 10 to 15,000 calories a day, which is, you know,
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:15.280]   I could probably count on my hand a couple of occasions where I've eaten that much in my life.
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.600]   So now I got to do that for six plus weeks in a row.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:19.760]   - And you don't want to have any stomach problems.
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:19.840]   - Right.
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:22.160]   - Or try to minimize the amount of stomach problems.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:26.720]   So would you estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of running every day?
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.600]   - Yeah, that's probably like from the first step to the last step, it'll probably be somewhere
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:36.240]   around like, say 14 hours, 13 hours or something like that would be a pretty good estimate.
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:38.000]   - And then getting rest.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.680]   And so, and then minimizing the risk of injury, which could be as small as like,
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:46.640]   like literally uneven surfaces resulting to like stepping the wrong way.
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:48.400]   I mean, that's going to be a lot of steps.
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:49.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:52.480]   - So the probability of injury, are you worried about that kind of stuff?
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:58.000]   Can you strengthen the ankles or those kinds of things that prevent possibility of injury?
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:04.080]   - And that's where I'm putting a lot of my focus in is, I think like just being running fit is
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.760]   going to be like, generally speaking is going to be important.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:12.000]   I'm going to, I think just from a lifetime of running is going to be a huge advantage.
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:16.960]   A lot of these like kind of like mechanical movements are going to be very established.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:19.440]   It's just going to be about, can I tolerate that volume of it?
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:22.320]   I think that I'm doing more strength work.
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:26.720]   I think this is something where it's like, you know, maybe adding five pounds of lower body muscle
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:30.160]   is going to be an advantage versus a disadvantage when you're looking at power weight ratio.
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:35.120]   'Cause I just really don't, I never need to be running a 648 mile for this adventure.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:40.880]   And so I'm looking at, I'm doing a lot more of that stuff, focusing on that.
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:46.480]   The training is changing a fair bit where it's more polarizing versus kind of being,
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.400]   I mean, I've always had some polarization in my training, but this is even to an extreme where
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:55.520]   like I'm going to do some simulations where, you know, I go out and do two or three days
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:58.880]   where I target the exact thing I will be doing on the Transcon.
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.440]   - You were on Instagram posting about these simulated runs.
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:06.160]   So you legitimately like trying to perfectly copy what would happen in one,
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.080]   two or three day segment on that run.
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:12.720]   - Yeah, just to kind of start to weed out where are the potential problems.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:18.240]   So let's say I do a two or three day simulation where I'm averaging 70 miles a day
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.600]   and I find out at the end of three days, there's a really weak spot here.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.600]   I need to address that or I need to find a way to make that not a weak spot.
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:29.680]   I think that's the only way to really get as close as you can to avoiding injury.
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.320]   - Have you done that yet? Have you done a two day, 70 mile?
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:34.320]   Like even that's incredibly difficult.
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.160]   - I haven't yet, I'm going to build up to it.
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.880]   Because that's the other thing too is like, I don't think you want to be so aggressive
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.960]   with that where you get injured trying to figure out how not to get injured.
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:47.920]   So what I'm going to start, what I just started last week is I've,
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.600]   it looks really weird on my training schedule because like last week,
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:54.160]   I ran almost 150 miles, but I took two days off.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:57.520]   So it's like usually for me to get to 150 miles, that's a seven day training week.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:59.520]   So that's the way I'm doing it.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:04.560]   Like I did a day where I did, you know, two like just over 20 milers
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:07.360]   separated with by just a couple hours.
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:10.400]   And within that couple hours, I did like a three mile walk.
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:12.320]   The following morning I woke up and ran.
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.360]   I think it was like just over 36 miles first thing in the morning
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:18.400]   just to get an idea of just like, kind of like, what is it like to be?
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:19.600]   I mean, this was in Phoenix too.
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:21.520]   So it was a hundred degrees for the majority of that.
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:24.320]   - So just suffer, then rest, suffer again.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.680]   How that feels.
[02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:30.800]   - There's enough precedent with this sort of an activity where like everyone I've talked to so far
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:34.640]   has told me like, there is going to be like this kind of like gradual decline
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:36.720]   in the early stages where you're just like, okay, it's getting worse,
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:38.080]   it's getting worse, it's getting worse.
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:42.400]   And you hit a point where you're just like, it hits kind of rock bottom.
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:45.360]   And then like, it starts to kind of gradually improve.
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:48.560]   So you kind of have to let yourself get, it's weird.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:53.040]   I think I can maybe eliminate, I'm trying to find a way to eliminate some of that
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:55.120]   by doing the simulations.
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:59.040]   Whereas I, from what I've seen, I haven't seen a lot of people do the simulation route yet.
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:02.560]   I've seen people just do like a lot of training and then say like, okay,
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:05.360]   I'll spend the first seven to 10 days adapting to this.
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:09.680]   And then I'll get comfortable within this environment and be fine.
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:13.520]   Whereas I'm going to try to get to a point where like some of that is already kind of
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:16.400]   cleared up before I start, but not so much that I'm like adding
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:19.360]   like an extra essential week to the trip worth of running.
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:23.760]   - What do you think will be the hardest simulator run leading up to it?
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:25.360]   Like, will you do three days?
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.280]   - Yeah, I think I'll probably try to do three days,
[02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:31.360]   somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each will be kind of like the goal.
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:32.800]   - Will that be in August?
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.000]   Do you think how close to?
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.920]   - Yeah, I would like it to be in August.
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.280]   Like early August would be ideal.
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:39.040]   I think like maybe the first week in August,
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:41.840]   'cause that gives me kind of three weeks to let things kind of settle down from that.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.960]   - This is crazy.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:44.240]   This is incredible.
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.640]   - It's actually interesting 'cause like, if I did, let's say I did the simulation now,
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:53.600]   the problem with that is like the adaptations from just like the breakdown
[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:56.160]   and the strengthening would likely be gone unless I did it again.
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:02.320]   So I wanna inch up to it so that like, and get close enough to the starting date
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:04.320]   so that I'm still kind of like, you know,
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:07.360]   holding onto that adaptation when I start it.
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:09.600]   So then those first few days maybe aren't quite as miserable.
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:13.680]   - And you said if everything goes amazing
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:16.800]   and you're challenging the record, it would be like a 42 day run?
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:19.760]   - Yeah, so that's what the record is, almost exactly six weeks.
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:21.920]   And that's at 72 and a half miles per day, so.
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:23.920]   - Will you be posting online and like--
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:26.480]   - Yeah, Instagram's gonna be a big one.
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:29.520]   I think I might do a few like YouTube stuff along the way too.
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:33.280]   Yeah, I'm still ironing out exactly how much.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:36.400]   I think at minimum I'll do some Instagram stuff.
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.480]   I think I'll go live on Instagram a few times during the day
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:42.400]   when I take like walking breaks, partly just to kind of,
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:46.320]   I think keeping people in, I mean, it stays true to the goal of raising awareness,
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:51.040]   but it also, I find when you bring people in,
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:52.720]   there is an added pressure to that.
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:55.680]   But there's also this sense that I've learned
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:56.800]   from the treadmill experience,
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:22:59.440]   since we had like a pretty big production for that,
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:01.120]   in the sense that, I mean, as much as you can
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:02.480]   turn on a camera in your own house,
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:07.120]   but like I remember thinking we had like 30 people lined up
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:08.880]   to come in and guest speak during that.
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:11.600]   And there was points of that where I was like,
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:13.360]   you know, you get that voice we talked about at the beginning
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.360]   where it's like, you know, maybe you could quit.
[02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.600]   Like, do you really need to run 100 miles on a treadmill?
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:19.280]   Is this really going to be valuable for you?
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:19.680]   - Yeah.
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:21.200]   - And then you think about, oh, you know what?
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:23.200]   There's, you know, Courtney DeWalter,
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:25.520]   one of the best female ultra runners to ever exist,
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:29.600]   is taking 30 minutes to an hour out of her day
[02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:33.680]   to come on in two hours to, you know, help me,
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:35.520]   you know, amplify this event.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.080]   And do I really want to be sending emails out to these people saying,
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:41.520]   hey guys, I know you were gracious enough to block out time of your day.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:42.960]   You know, I think there's a little bit of that to do
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:45.680]   where you're like, you're jumping in with the community
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:47.200]   that is following along and saying,
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.280]   here's how things are going, show them the best,
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:50.480]   the worst and everything in between.
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:53.520]   And then ultimately have that hold you accountable a little bit too.
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:55.760]   It's like hard to get up in the morning and not go back out.
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.920]   - I don't know how you are, but I had to,
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:01.040]   whenever I did any kind of physical stuff,
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:04.320]   like the 48 hour challenge or just any kind of running,
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.640]   I hated turning on the camera.
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:08.560]   I hated it.
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:11.680]   Like, cause you have to like smile and be friendly and stuff.
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:13.920]   - Oh, I'm just gonna be super miserable if I'm-
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:14.420]   - Miserable.
[02:24:14.420 --> 02:24:16.240]   Well, that's it.
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:17.360]   So like, exactly.
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.440]   In some sense, that's what people-
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:22.560]   - Are we gonna get a happy Zach or an angry Zach?
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:23.120]   - Exactly.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.720]   It's like you're making bets.
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.800]   And I'm sure there'll be some days, maybe not many,
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:32.320]   maybe very few where you're truly happy with yourself.
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:36.080]   Like for some weird ecstatic reason,
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:39.600]   maybe if you get over the hump, whatever that you mentioned, that this dip.
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:45.120]   I mean, it's fascinating how much suffering this actually entails, I wonder.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:49.520]   - Well, and one thing I'm gonna definitely try to leverage to my advantage.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:52.640]   And one of the reasons why I think Fight for the Forgotten
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:55.600]   was the charity that really triggered me to decide to do this.
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:58.880]   The transcontinental route was something I learned about
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.400]   early in my ultra running career.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:02.080]   And I thought to myself, I wanna do that someday.
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:04.480]   But it was one of those kind of far off distance things
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.320]   that had never really like actualized in your mind
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:08.320]   until you put a date down or, you know,
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:10.880]   mention it on the Joe Rogan experience or something like that.
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:10.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:13.920]   - But then it's like people wanna know when is this happening.
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:19.040]   And, you know, what I try to think about is, you know,
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:21.840]   the reason Justin identified the Pygmy tribe
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:25.680]   was because they were super forgotten where, you know,
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:28.160]   we think about just like some of these third world countries
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:32.000]   where it's a scenario of like some people,
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.640]   it's easy for us here in the US to think to ourselves,
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:36.160]   well, why don't they just industrialize?
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:39.120]   Why don't they just like, you know, start to innovate a bit?
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.800]   Why are they so primitive?
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:41.920]   What's wrong with them?
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:43.680]   And in reality, like when you take,
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:46.400]   when you scale things down to the degree
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:49.440]   where you need the entire day
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.440]   because of the situation you're in
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.560]   just to take care of your basic needs of water and food,
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:57.760]   you never get the opportunity to even build a real,
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.440]   like establishment or, you know, a build on that.
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.040]   Like you need the free time
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:04.960]   or you need a portion of your population
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.960]   to have the free time available to innovate.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:09.920]   And the Pygmy tribe just hadn't had that historically.
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:11.600]   In fact, they weren't even considered humans
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:13.760]   by like the local government for quite some time.
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:16.080]   And, you know, the people that really pay the price
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:17.680]   in some of these situations are the women
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:19.120]   because they're the ones that get saddled
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.680]   with like the water gathering and things like that.
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:24.720]   So the reason that Justin picked wells to build
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:25.840]   was 'cause he thought to himself,
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:27.520]   if we can get them wells,
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.840]   then now these women don't have to spend all day
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:31.600]   walking and carrying water.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.200]   Now they can just get that water.
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.200]   And now we have half the population freed up
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:35.840]   for other things.
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:37.360]   Now maybe they can start farms.
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:39.440]   They can build some housing and stuff like that.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.000]   And it just, it exponentially improves
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.880]   once you take care of some of those big key early things.
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.080]   So when I'm thinking about like, you know,
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:49.200]   do I really need to go out here
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.880]   and travel another 12 hours a day?
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.640]   My mind's gonna hopefully go to,
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:55.120]   well, if one of those women woke up in the Pygmy tribe
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:56.240]   one morning and decided, you know what,
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.840]   do I really need to go get water today?
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.120]   It's like, well, yeah, you do.
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.480]   You really do have to.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:01.520]   - Yeah, you're running for that.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.480]   Yeah, and that will give you fuel, hopefully.
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:08.080]   - Yeah, I mean, the reality is always there
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.680]   where I don't have to do it.
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:11.520]   Like they do have to do it.
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:14.480]   So, you know, but I think just keeping that perspective,
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:18.160]   it puts us back to the beginning
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:20.800]   where this is one of those situations
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:24.480]   where I think it's like a no quit situation.
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:26.960]   You have to put yourself in a no quit situation here
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:29.680]   because it's, you know, it's just bigger than you.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.520]   - I can't wait to see like the dark places you go.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:36.320]   I mean, there's some, yeah, the quit situations.
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:39.440]   And hopefully we get to have a glimpse of those
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:41.280]   'cause I think those are really inspiring
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:44.960]   when somebody is, both gets broken by them
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:46.800]   'cause you know how tough you are,
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:49.440]   but also is almost broken and overcomes it.
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:51.040]   I mean, that's just fascinating stories.
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:51.680]   I can't wait.
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:54.400]   I know, does Joe know you're doing this, by the way?
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:57.440]   - Yeah, I sent him a note a while back
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:59.440]   'cause he was the first spot I mentioned it on.
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:00.320]   So I think he knows.
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:01.840]   I'm not sure if he's followed along
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:02.960]   about the exact starting date or not.
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:03.760]   - Well, he will know.
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.400]   This is great.
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:05.520]   (laughing)
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:10.000]   He'll probably think you're crazy MF-er for doing this,
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.320]   but I think he'll love it.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.600]   And I think I love it.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.200]   And I think the world will love it.
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.400]   A ridiculous question.
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.560]   Who's the greatest endurance runner
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:20.800]   or endurance athlete of all time?
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.120]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:29.120]   I think I'd probably go maybe two directions here.
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:37.280]   I think Heli Gebrilassi is one of the best, in my opinion,
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:42.640]   because just, I mean, 27 world records.
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:45.680]   Like not all the different distance,
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:48.320]   but like breaking and re-breaking and that sort of stuff.
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.320]   I mean, he ran two, what was it?
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:56.480]   203.59 before the shoe technology came in.
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:58.480]   That is estimated at anywhere between a two
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:28:59.920]   to 8% performance advantage.
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:02.160]   - You're talking about a two hour marathon, two, zero, three.
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:02.560]   - Yep.
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:03.840]   - Two hour, three minutes marathon.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:04.240]   - Yep.
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:04.400]   Yeah.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.240]   So he did that with the old shoe technology,
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:09.200]   which essentially dates back to anything.
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:11.520]   If you were a Nike athlete,
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:15.760]   it could date back to as early as, I think, early 2016
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:17.440]   is when the first prototype started showing up.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:20.240]   So if you're before that in your career,
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:23.040]   you're guaranteed to be using the old shoe technology.
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:26.560]   And I mean, just the range of it too.
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:29.280]   And yeah, it's hard.
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:30.240]   I mean, there's, it's a-
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:31.920]   - Is he a marathon runner purely?
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:33.120]   - No, he did everything.
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:34.160]   That's why I pick him, I think,
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:36.000]   because he went everywhere,
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.480]   everything from the 800 and is like at a national level.
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:39.120]   - 800?
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.400]   - Yeah, at a national level.
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.720]   I don't, he wasn't competing at like Olympics
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.600]   or anything in the 800,
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.560]   but he was mostly like 5k to marathon.
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.480]   Yeah.
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:49.280]   Yeah.
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.000]   So just incredible.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.480]   I mean, I could go a totally different direction too.
[02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:54.400]   I think like Steve Prefontaine stands out
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:55.680]   in as an American runner,
[02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:58.160]   just because if you look at it outside of just like
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:00.800]   performances and stuff like that,
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:04.400]   I think he based,
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:08.320]   like you can't find an American male runner
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:12.480]   who probably didn't get some motivation
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:14.160]   or some catalyst into their running journey
[02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:15.760]   from a Prefontaine story.
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:18.160]   - What would you say is inspiring about Prefontaine?
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.720]   Like from the philosophy, from the technique,
[02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:21.520]   from his story?
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:24.240]   - I think there's a few things.
[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:25.200]   I mean, there's a lot of things,
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:26.400]   which is why he is who he is.
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:28.800]   It's one was just his attitude about it
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:32.400]   where he wasn't like this picture ask runner.
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:34.800]   I mean, he was obviously talented,
[02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:37.120]   but you have the perfect story of like,
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:38.480]   he wanted to be good at something.
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.640]   Most American kids tried football.
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:43.920]   No hard work was going to get Prefontaine
[02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:45.920]   starting in varsity for football.
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:48.400]   Starts running, fell in love with the mile.
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:50.800]   His college coach told him,
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:51.920]   no, you're not going to be a miler.
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:53.200]   You're going to be a 5K guy.
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:55.840]   And he popularized the 5K in the United States
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:57.200]   or three mile in some cases.
[02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:00.640]   And I mean, the way he would race,
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:03.680]   I think is what really made him interesting for folks
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:06.320]   where he was just like all guts runner,
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.800]   where he's like, I mean, one of his famous quotes
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:11.040]   was like, if you beat me,
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:12.240]   you're going to have to bleed to do it.
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:13.760]   'Cause he's going to be an all guts race
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:16.240]   and in a sport where it gets very tactical at times,
[02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:17.200]   especially at the like,
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:19.120]   or I shouldn't say national,
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:21.680]   but at the like competition level,
[02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:22.880]   the championship level,
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:25.520]   where it's like kind of more of a sit and kick approach.
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:26.960]   A lot of times where everyone's kind of waiting
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:28.000]   for someone to make a move,
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.080]   like Pre was going to make a move really early.
[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:32.320]   - Yeah, so this idea of leading from the front,
[02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:35.280]   which I guess is tactically really a bad idea.
[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:39.520]   - Well, from a running a PR standpoint,
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:41.840]   it's a bad idea in most cases.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:45.520]   - But so race, I guess, is not just about the PR.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:48.480]   - It's about winning in a lot of cases.
[02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:49.840]   And that's what he thought was going to put him
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:51.120]   in the best advantage to win, I think.
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.480]   - It's just the run from the front.
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:54.160]   I mean, what do you, 'cause you mentioned this,
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:57.360]   the 100 mile you ran, you were in second place.
[02:31:57.360 --> 02:31:58.800]   And then in nineties,
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:01.760]   you were able to get to the first place.
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:05.120]   How hard is it to run when you're in first place?
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:08.000]   - You know, I think this is really different.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.440]   Some people thrive under it,
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:10.560]   where it's like for them,
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:12.080]   I mean, like I talked about Jim Walms before,
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:13.760]   I think he loves being in the front.
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:15.280]   If he's in the front, he loves it.
[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:16.320]   That's where he's excited.
[02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:18.880]   That's where he knows he's doing what he's doing,
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:21.120]   where he's pushing his limits and things like that.
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:23.360]   Pre was probably the same way.
[02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:24.480]   And then I think there's other folks
[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:26.880]   who are much more comfortable kind of saying,
[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:29.040]   let's let things settle down here a little bit.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.800]   And then I'll make my move
[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:32.240]   when it's time to make my move.
[02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:33.360]   Or they think of it as,
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:36.000]   and this is a very important, I think, lesson
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000]   for the average ultra runner is just like,
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.800]   knowing what you're capable of
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:42.720]   is gonna be an important piece to the puzzle
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.280]   because you can try to say,
[02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:49.520]   I wanna run faster than I'm capable of
[02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:51.760]   in an early part of a hundred miler,
[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:53.840]   but then you're gonna pay for it at the end.
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:56.000]   So really, unless you're trying to go for the win,
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.240]   and that's a tactic that you think is gonna produce a win
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.080]   versus trying to run your fastest time,
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:02.560]   you gotta run within yourself, within your parameters.
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:04.560]   Obviously, there's a big question mark
[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:06.320]   about where those parameters are in a lot of cases,
[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:08.400]   which makes ultra marathon even more interesting
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:10.480]   'cause it's like, there's so much unknown about it.
[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:12.160]   It's like, well, maybe you can go faster
[02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:13.440]   and we just don't know yet.
[02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:15.600]   - So there's, in the face of that uncertainty,
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:18.960]   there's something admirable, like it was with Prefontaine,
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:21.520]   where you take the risk and run faster than
[02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:25.280]   you think you might be able to run
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:28.400]   in terms of pace that you can hold.
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.960]   So push the pace that's possible.
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.160]   - Yeah, explore the unknown.
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:32.720]   - Explore the unknown.
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:34.480]   - It's like a pioneer spirit, right?
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:34.800]   - Yeah.
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:36.960]   - You know, the next frontier kind of a thing.
[02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:38.800]   And I mean, Prefontaine,
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:40.560]   also there's other angles with him too,
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:42.240]   where he was like in the amateur era,
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:44.560]   where to be an Olympian, you couldn't be pro.
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:47.200]   So he's turning down, I mean, the guy was on food stamps
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:48.240]   and living in a trailer
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:50.080]   because he wanted to run at the Olympics.
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:52.960]   And there was a lot of like politics involved
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:55.440]   with not being able to take sponsorship money
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:57.040]   and things like that, which has changed since then.
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.960]   So he was huge in the movement for that
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:04.240]   to kind of like, you know, have a situation
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:06.880]   where now as an athlete, you can finish,
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:08.800]   in most cases, finish college,
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:11.280]   sign a big contract with a sponsor,
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.440]   and then also still compete in the Olympic Games
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:14.960]   and go to the events that are actually ones
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:17.200]   that are gonna likely catapult your career
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.200]   in most of the Olympic distance endurance events.
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:21.280]   So he just revolutionized the sport.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:23.440]   And then to add even more flavor to the whole thing,
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:25.440]   I mean, he died a very premature death.
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:28.400]   He got in a car accident and died before
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:31.680]   he would have likely probably medaled at the Olympics.
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:32.480]   So he--
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:34.480]   - And there is a tragedy of the fact that he didn't.
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:38.240]   - Yeah, well, he was fourth place at the Olympics,
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:40.640]   the prior, his first go of it.
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:41.920]   And it was kind of one of those things
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:43.520]   where it's like fourth place at the Olympics
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:44.560]   is the first man looking out
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:45.680]   or the first woman looking out.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:47.920]   And for a guy that had as much hype as him,
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:49.440]   I think like a medal was something
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:51.280]   he really wanted to take home with him there.
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.680]   - And especially how that race went.
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.360]   I mean, I don't know, it's tragic, the whole thing,
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:34:59.760]   but that's one of the things that makes Olympics amazing
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:00.800]   is the tragedy of it.
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:04.560]   Like one race decides the story of a lifetime,
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:08.160]   which is like, that's why it's amazing.
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:10.960]   Even if a lot of people get hurt because of it.
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:16.000]   Tragedy makes the triumph special.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:16.880]   - Right, yeah.
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:20.640]   And it makes life like a movie almost.
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:21.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:23.680]   - If everything's all sunshine and rainbows,
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:25.120]   then it's not as entertaining to watch.
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.720]   There's no adversity to overcome.
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:28.480]   - You mentioned shoe technology.
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:31.920]   How much has shoe technology advanced
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:33.600]   through the past few decades?
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:35.920]   How much has it changed running generally,
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:38.960]   but also running like ultra marathon running?
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.880]   - I would say in ultra running,
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:44.000]   it's had much of a less of an impact
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.280]   because ultra running is still heavily skewed
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:48.000]   towards the trails.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.600]   So the technology, at least from what we know,
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:52.960]   isn't necessarily translating over
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:54.960]   to these like massive varied terrain,
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:57.280]   certainly not the technical terrain and things like that.
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:35:59.840]   Now on road races, flat stuff, like the track stuff,
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:02.960]   the roads, the run, I guess a runnable trail,
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:05.440]   where it's just like basically crushed limestone,
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:08.320]   more or less, you definitely get an advantage from it.
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:13.520]   And essentially what happened is in,
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:16.320]   this probably dated back actually before 2015,
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:24.000]   Nike decided their development team was ahead of the curve.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.680]   They've developed this new foam,
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:26.880]   they call it like a Peebok foam.
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:29.760]   And they realized that,
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.520]   like when you step down into a shoe,
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:34.320]   the reason like racers a lot of times
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:36.720]   would wear these flats is 'cause they're trying to take out
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:39.280]   any of that lost energy into the foam in the shoe.
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:43.200]   Well, this foam that Nike came out with is so good
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.760]   that it actually returns way more energy
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:47.280]   than the average foam did.
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:49.520]   To the point where like when they test these things
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:51.280]   on like force plate treadmills and things like that,
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:53.680]   it's like depending on the person's gait
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:55.600]   and some of the things is like a two to 8%
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:57.200]   improvement in performance.
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.840]   I mean, we've seen records just across the board
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.200]   get broken since this came out.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:02.320]   - All distances.
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:03.760]   - Basically, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.480]   I think from at least from the 5K up through the marathon,
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:11.040]   and I mean, we've seen some insane improvements
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:11.840]   in the marathon.
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:14.400]   I think like the women's marathon went from
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:16.960]   what was considered relatively untouchable,
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:19.440]   like 216 to a 214.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.800]   And I mean, like it was like 218 was like just world-class.
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:26.560]   Like if you could run a 218 marathon as a woman,
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:28.640]   that was like, I mean, it still is to a degree,
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:30.640]   but then now you have someone run a 214.
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:32.400]   Like that's a huge jump.
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:34.640]   - And you attribute a lot of that to the shoe.
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:36.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:38.160]   I think there's probably other things that come in mind too.
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:40.480]   Like now that people know there's a performance advantage
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:42.000]   from a mechanical standpoint,
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.600]   it's also a confidence thing where it's like,
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:46.960]   oh, now I can probably try going five seconds per mile faster
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:48.160]   and maybe they could have anyway.
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:50.080]   And they just, now they think they can, so they are.
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:51.520]   So there's probably a little bit of that
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:52.800]   that's just adding to it.
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:55.120]   - Do you think there's a lot of extra innovation
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:56.080]   that's still possible?
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:58.960]   Like what, if you could do this kind of big leap
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.520]   with a little innovation of foam,
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.880]   is there other stuff that you can do
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:05.680]   or further innovation of materials that make up the foam?
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:09.120]   - Yeah, so they can definitely go much more advantage.
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.640]   They put a cap on it essentially.
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:14.160]   So there's also a carbon plate element to this too,
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:16.000]   where they put like this carbon plate in there
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:16.880]   in between the foam.
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.120]   So like I believe when Kipchak Ghi broke,
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:25.520]   well, when they did that kind of the sub two hour project,
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:28.960]   he actually had on a shoe, if I'm not mistaken,
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:30.320]   that never got to market
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.080]   because they put down some parameters on it
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:35.120]   after, before that one came to market,
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:38.000]   where it was actually like stacked up to,
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.280]   I can't remember how many millimeters,
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:40.240]   it was an insane amount.
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:41.520]   And they had like, I think maybe even
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:42.720]   three layer plates in there.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:44.320]   - And that was a Nike shoe he was wearing?
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:45.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:48.400]   So what makes it kind of controversial or difficult
[02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:50.960]   is Nike came out with these prototypes.
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:53.040]   So a prototype for people that don't understand shoes,
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:55.040]   like these companies, they'll develop a shoe
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:57.040]   and it usually takes like somewhere in the neighborhood
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:00.000]   of like probably 18 months to hit the market.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.200]   So if you're like a sponsored athlete
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.320]   or work for the company,
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.760]   you can get your hands on these shoes
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:07.040]   before they actually come to market.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:09.440]   So we had an issue, I think,
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:11.040]   this wasn't necessarily as big of an issue
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:12.320]   in the ultra running community,
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:15.440]   but in the track and field Olympic distance stuff
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:18.720]   was a big issue because you had Nike athletes
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:20.080]   having these prototype shoes
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:21.440]   before anyone could get them.
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:22.880]   And then you had athletes who were sponsored
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.720]   by these other brands who couldn't wear them
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:27.600]   even when they did come to market.
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:29.680]   So then we had this like chase to catch up
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:32.000]   where other companies are starting
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.200]   to make their own version of it.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:34.800]   And now we're getting to a point
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:37.680]   where most companies have a version of that shoe.
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:41.600]   But we had a huge transition phase
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.800]   that impacted the Olympics big time.
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:46.880]   I mean, think of it, here's an example of it.
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:50.320]   There was an athlete, Kara Goucher.
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:53.520]   She was not, she was a Nike athlete,
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:56.240]   wasn't when they came out with this shoe.
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:59.760]   And she ran the Olympic trial marathon
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:02.720]   and got fourth place, first person out.
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:05.280]   And two of the people had her had that shoe on.
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:07.520]   And she was maybe a minute or two,
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:08.560]   like I'd have to look to see exactly,
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:11.840]   but it was within the performance advantage range.
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:14.800]   And so you could argue that she was the first person
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:17.440]   in modern running to lose an Olympic spot
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:19.360]   due to a technological disadvantage.
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:20.000]   - Wow.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.480]   - And it's like, I mean, it's one of those--
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:22.960]   - It's kind of profound.
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:25.120]   - Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things where like,
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:28.880]   it's a transition, right?
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:30.480]   So there's gonna be bumpy road
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:31.760]   and there's gonna be people that get caught
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:34.320]   in that transition that it's unfortunate for.
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:38.560]   But it's also like, once everything does catch up
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:41.200]   and every shoe company has a version of this,
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:42.160]   there's still problems.
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:43.760]   I mean, these are incredibly expensive shoes.
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:45.440]   It's like a $250 shoe.
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:46.720]   So it's like, at what point do you tell
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:50.240]   a wealthy family with a high school kid that,
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:52.320]   you can get that $250 shoe,
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.160]   but then you go and this kid's family
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.520]   can barely afford a pair of shoes for them,
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:57.360]   much less a $250 pair of shoes.
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:40:58.640]   Like, where do we draw that line?
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:00.160]   And that sort of stuff.
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:03.680]   Also just, here's the other big one.
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:06.640]   Like, let's, I mean, two to 8% is a massive range.
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:08.880]   What if you're on the 2% versus someone's on the 8%?
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:11.680]   You know, chances are, if you're, you know,
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:13.120]   blowing a record out of the water,
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:16.000]   you're probably closer to that high end percentage
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000]   versus someone who's maybe getting incremental gains,
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.840]   you're probably closer to that lower end.
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:22.400]   So is it fair to have a piece of equipment
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:23.760]   that has that big of a range
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.920]   when we're talking about less than a percent
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.080]   determining these races when all is held constant?
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:30.640]   - Those are fascinating, like philosophical questions
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:33.600]   that I think it's nice to solve that for the shoe
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:35.760]   or to raise those questions for a shoe,
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:37.600]   because the more complicated place
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.160]   where they will be raised is probably like genetics,
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:42.000]   genetic engineering, all those kinds of things.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.400]   - Yeah, you'll get a lot more complicated.
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:46.240]   - So it's nice when you have like
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:47.760]   a particular piece of technology
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:49.760]   that's just like right there, it's a shoe,
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.440]   we can understand it, we can study it.
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:54.400]   - Right, and we may be coming on the precipice
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:57.360]   of like human powered sport performances
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:59.440]   no longer being something that we like look at
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:02.560]   as this like pinnacle of, like, I don't know,
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:04.400]   maybe entertainment's the wrong word,
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:06.160]   but like, is that a pursuit?
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:09.280]   You know, do we end up just going a different direction?
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.120]   I mean, I think it's like, it's so hard for us
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:12.320]   to think about that right now,
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.000]   because it's so part of like the culture
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.560]   and the lifestyle of the average person,
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.960]   where like sport is a hobby of theirs,
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:20.800]   as well as a passion to follow.
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:24.320]   And it's like, how complicated does it need to get
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:26.240]   before people lose that interest?
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.920]   - And there could be a future
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:29.840]   where most of the Olympics is eSports.
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:32.800]   Somebody told me that eSports is in the Olympics.
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.000]   I've been meaning to look this up.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:34.800]   - Oh. - Huh.
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:36.880]   Which is, you know, like what video,
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.640]   so video games are in the Olympics now.
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:39.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.520]   - It could be as like a trial that they're doing.
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:42.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.840]   - But if this is true, I'm trying in real time to look it up,
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.160]   but if this eSports joining Olympics in 2024, wow.
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.040]   So that could be just a, that could be a fun side thing,
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:00.720]   but it could be a first step into a complete transformation
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:01.600]   of what sports mean.
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:01.920]   - Yeah.
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:03.520]   - 'Cause you can control video games better
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:07.040]   than you control for genetics in humans.
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:09.680]   - Well, and in reality, we've been dealing with this problem
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:12.400]   in other areas, just with the performance enhancing side
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:14.160]   of things with drugs and all that stuff too.
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:16.880]   And anyway, that conversation's flared back up
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:19.040]   with track and field too, where we are seeing a lot
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:19.840]   of records get broken.
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:21.600]   A lot of it probably is to shoot technology,
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:24.800]   but you know, in 2020 with the COVID stuff,
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:27.520]   you have all these out of competition testing protocols
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:30.000]   that a lot of these top tier Olympic athletes are getting
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.440]   to try to eliminate, like, is it, like,
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:35.520]   if you just do inter competition testing,
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:38.080]   like there's potential for people to do things
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:40.800]   that are gonna give them a performance advantage,
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:43.600]   but not gonna show up on that test on the day of
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:46.240]   or after their race, where now you have these,
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:48.000]   like, limitations of being able to test.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.600]   So do we have a group of athletes now who decide,
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:54.400]   oh, I'm not gonna get tested in 2020 due to COVID restrictions.
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:56.400]   Is it the time to dope up and then, you know,
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:43:59.120]   hit some stride in some records and then taper back off
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.720]   when they get this thing fired back up again?
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:02.720]   And so there may be some of that as well.
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:04.640]   And I mean, that's always been an ongoing problem.
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:07.520]   - Yeah, but the boost you get from performance enhancing drugs
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.840]   could be tiny relative to the stuff we have in the future.
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:10.400]   - Right, yeah.
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:12.880]   - So you might be the last generation of, like,
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:17.840]   natural, unmodified humans that were running.
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:20.000]   - And who knows, maybe that's already over.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000]   Who knows who's modified.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.360]   - That's true.
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:26.480]   You might, we might be living through that transition
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:29.120]   to the new Nike shoe, but broadly defined.
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:30.800]   - Uh-huh, yeah.
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:34.160]   - So you'll be, in some sense, in the history books
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:38.400]   as humans used to run without any modifications.
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:40.960]   - They used to destroy their body and let it recover
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:41.760]   and then do it again.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000]   - And they used to be impressed with an 11-hour,
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.880]   a hundred mile time where we could do it in under an hour now.
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:51.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:54.720]   - So, but nevertheless, it is incredible.
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:58.800]   The four mile, the four minute mile was incredibly impressive.
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:04.400]   I really love the 11-hour mark for the 100 miler.
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:07.520]   And the two hour marathon by most people
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:10.960]   for the longest time was thought to be impossible.
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:14.320]   There's still people that think it's impossible
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:15.760]   under certain constraints.
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:21.120]   So, Elliot Kipchoge of Kenya, as you mentioned,
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:26.480]   ran a one hour, 59 minute, 40 second marathon.
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.200]   But he had, like you said, the prototype shoes
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:32.800]   and he had the pace setters.
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:33.280]   - Yeah.
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:35.200]   - I don't know how essential that is,
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:37.040]   but it seems quite essential.
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:38.560]   Do you think it's possible?
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:40.480]   First of all, what do you think about that accomplishment?
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:43.120]   And he is one of the greatest,
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:45.520]   if not the greatest marathon runners of all time.
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:47.760]   What do you think about that accomplishment?
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:50.400]   And do you think it's possible to run a two hour marathon
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:51.840]   without any assistance?
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:54.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I think there's no question about it,
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:57.440]   regardless of technology, he's world-class,
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:45:58.240]   if not the best.
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:04.640]   I think he could go under two hours,
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:07.920]   someone equivalent to him could go under two hours
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:10.800]   with the shoe technology.
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:14.480]   Probably, what it'll take is it'll take a fast course,
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.240]   a course that has like very few tangents,
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:20.160]   because like turning on a course,
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:23.680]   they estimate it adds about a percent to the distance.
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:26.240]   So, when we're talking about a marathon,
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:28.240]   you're getting up to like a quarter mile extra running,
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:30.400]   you know, that alone could potentially put you down
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:33.600]   near two flat based on what we're seeing.
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:39.200]   'Cause I mean, Kipchakee's got a, was it 20140, I believe,
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:40.640]   is his actual world record,
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:42.720]   where it's actually like certified.
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:43.920]   So, I mean, he's right on the door,
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:45.520]   knocking on the door there.
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:48.720]   We had the prototype he had,
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:50.240]   since then they put in a regulation
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:52.080]   where you can't stack a shoe for the roads
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.520]   more than 40 millimeters.
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:56.240]   So, you can only have so much of that energy returning foam,
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:57.360]   and you can only have, I think,
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:46:59.120]   one carbon plate in there now.
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.480]   So, that puts a little bit of a ceiling
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:03.920]   on that technological thing.
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:07.200]   But who knows what else will come out in that.
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:09.920]   And to be honest, who comes out with it?
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:12.960]   Because the fact that Nike came out with this technology
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:16.080]   is the reason why it's being allowed to be used.
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:17.440]   If it would have been like, you know,
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:19.600]   another running company that came out with it,
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:21.840]   I'm sure the regulations
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:23.360]   would have been slapped down on it immediately.
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:25.120]   And they would have probably just thrown it out altogether.
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:26.480]   - Also, there's politics.
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:27.600]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:33.680]   Well, and I mean, you can go super negative with that
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:36.800]   and say like, "Hey, this is terrible,
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:38.400]   or this is super nefarious."
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:41.280]   When in reality, it's like, you have a company
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.000]   that has billions of dollars
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.920]   and is interested enough in the sport
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:48.160]   that otherwise doesn't generate a ton of revenue
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:50.720]   to pick up a big tab
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:54.480]   and support track and field and things like that.
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:59.040]   But with that, you want to be the guy who says,
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:02.000]   "Yeah, thanks for the millions and millions of dollars,
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:02.880]   but we're gonna...
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:06.480]   All those years and money you spent on that phone,
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:07.200]   you wasted it.
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:08.720]   We're not gonna let you use it."
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.560]   But if you're another company who revolutionizes the sport
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:14.000]   in potentially a negative way,
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.600]   maybe you say no to them.
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:18.640]   So it gets interesting.
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:19.360]   - That's the way of humanity.
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:20.560]   - That's how it always happens.
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:20.880]   - Yeah.
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:22.480]   - Yeah, there's really no way around it.
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:24.640]   - I think Phil Mephetone, I think it's him,
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:26.560]   that he wrote a book about a two-hour marathon.
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:27.920]   What are the limits?
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:28.800]   How fast could we run?
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:31.200]   And I think he puts it like an hour and 42 minutes,
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.360]   something like that, or 40-something minutes.
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:34.640]   It's kind of an interesting question
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:36.320]   of what are the limits.
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:40.800]   Do you think we'll just keep pushing the limits
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:44.000]   of what humans are capable of in the ultras,
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:44.960]   in the marathon?
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:48.400]   Is this just like the way of sport?
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:50.080]   - I mean, I think ultra for sure,
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:53.440]   because that is a vastly growing sport.
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:57.520]   And there's a lot of potential
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:02.000]   for a much bigger pool of talent to pull from
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.120]   that could really push the needle down
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:07.280]   on some of these performances and things like that,
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:09.760]   especially as it becomes more popular.
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:11.280]   If people start realizing,
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:13.120]   or I shouldn't say realizing,
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:15.120]   but if a scenario happens where like,
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.520]   "Oh, I'm one of the best endurance athletes in the world.
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:19.280]   "I make more money running ultra marathons
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:20.720]   "than I do running the marathon."
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:23.280]   Then all of a sudden we see every record get broken
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:24.480]   in a matter of a couple of years.
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:32.240]   For the marathon, I mean, it's gonna get faster, I think,
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:35.200]   but to what degree is so hard to know.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:36.160]   It's very hard to know.
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:38.240]   - The one hour and 40 minutes seems like--
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:38.960]   - That's pretty fast.
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:40.560]   - That's very fast.
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:42.400]   - I mean, for folks for some perspective there,
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:46.800]   the current world record is in the 440s per mile.
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:47.280]   - Per mile.
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:49.600]   - Like just to add a little flavor to that.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:50.720]   - You're basically sprinting.
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:52.320]   - Yeah, I mean, go out to a track
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:55.680]   and run one lap as fast as you can
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:58.560]   and then reflect on what time you get
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:01.280]   and realize like the world record for the marathon
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:07.440]   is that lap at just over 70 seconds per lap.
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:08.880]   So a minute and 10, just over that,
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:11.600]   but you're doing it 26.2 miles.
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:15.280]   So over a hundred times, it's mind boggling.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:17.920]   - But watching Elliot Kipchoge just,
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:20.000]   first of all, he was like smiling at the end of it.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.720]   So there's an extreme efficiency here too.
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:28.080]   So he's able to just find the right way to maximize,
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:30.400]   yeah, maximize efficiency.
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:31.520]   It makes it look easy.
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:34.560]   I mean, that's true for basically every Olympic athlete.
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:36.720]   When you watch gymnasts, they kind of make it look easy.
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:42.320]   But there's like tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:43.280]   behind that training.
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:45.600]   - Yeah, just to be comfortable enough to even attempt
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:48.000]   some of the moves they do in gymnastics is mind boggling.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.760]   - Well, that one is super awesome
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:53.440]   because how tragic it is, like one little slip up.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:54.880]   - Yeah, four years of work.
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:57.040]   - And you're, it's all gone.
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:50:59.280]   Not just four years of work for many of them.
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:50:59.840]   - A lifetime.
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:01.120]   - It's like a lifetime of work.
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:02.080]   - And they're teenagers.
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:05.600]   - And they're teenagers and they get dedicated everything
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:07.040]   to it.
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:11.040]   That's what makes the pursuits of humans so fascinating.
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:12.960]   We kind of talked about this a little bit already,
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:15.600]   but is there something that stands out to you
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:18.240]   as one of the hardest things you've had to overcome
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:20.960]   in all the either training
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:22.880]   or the competing that you've done?
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:24.800]   Has there been moments that kind of stand out
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:26.400]   where you're proud of yourself
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:30.320]   that you were truly tested and you overcame it?
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:34.000]   - I think I'd be more inclined just 'cause it stands out to me
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:38.320]   much bigger than any one hard decision
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:40.400]   or outcome I had from a particular race
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:45.920]   is just like the trajectory of doing what I'm doing now
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:49.040]   is so much different from what I would have ever expected.
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:52.960]   I was a talented enough runner
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:54.640]   where I could make the state meet by my senior year
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:56.240]   at a small Division III school
[02:51:56.240 --> 02:51:59.200]   and compete at a Division III college
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:01.280]   and be pretty modest talent
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:05.200]   comparative to my peers at the top level of Division III.
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:08.240]   To think that I'd be doing anything
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:11.120]   that was revolved around running as an occupation
[02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:15.120]   is I still second guess that that's actually occurring.
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:17.680]   Makes me wonder about the whole simulation theory thing.
[02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:18.640]   (both laughing)
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.280]   It's like, who's got my joystick and what am I doing with it?
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:22.080]   - Exactly.
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:22.960]   (laughs)
[02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:24.000]   They got the cheat codes.
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:26.800]   Yeah, 'cause I mean, I went to school to be a teacher
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:28.160]   and I really loved that profession.
[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:29.360]   I taught for about five years
[02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:31.280]   and then I got to a point where,
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:32.960]   you know, some of it's just perfect timing too,
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:34.480]   like the sport gained enough popularity
[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:35.440]   where there's enough money in it,
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:37.520]   where like I could start a coaching business,
[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:39.920]   I could get sponsorships and things like that
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:41.360]   and actually look at it and say,
[02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:43.680]   financially I can make a go of this or at least risk it.
[02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:46.160]   But there's such a fine line
[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:48.720]   between like deciding to do that
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:50.560]   or kind of staying comfortable
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:53.760]   because I mean, I was at the perfect teaching spot for me.
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:56.400]   I was at this like project-based learning school
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:52:58.720]   and just outside of Madison, Wisconsin, loved it.
[02:52:58.720 --> 02:53:00.800]   One of the hardest decisions in my life to make
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:01.920]   was to step away from that
[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:04.160]   to pursue running more holistically.
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:06.480]   And I mean, I almost didn't.
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:09.440]   I had a co-teacher who was, I was thinking to myself,
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:10.640]   I knew that it was like a decision
[02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:11.920]   I was gonna have to make the next few years,
[02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:13.360]   but it was such an easy decision to say,
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:15.360]   "Well, wait one more year."
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:16.320]   And he was just like,
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:17.920]   he was a little more of a free spirit than I was,
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:18.560]   certainly at the time.
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:20.000]   He's like, "Dude, what are you waiting for?
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:20.500]   "Just go.
[02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:22.320]   "Why are you here?"
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:23.760]   Like after I told him that,
[02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:27.280]   every time I'd come into school the next day
[02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:28.240]   and he'd be like, "Why are you still here?"
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:32.080]   But I mean, there's a tongue in cheek for sure.
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:35.120]   - But it's hard to know that you're gonna be successful
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:36.240]   in that kind of leap,
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:38.400]   given your, like, you know,
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:42.000]   'cause it's easier when you're like an ultra performer
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.400]   early on, but to have the faith
[02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:45.840]   that you can accomplish something.
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:49.760]   - In some regards, it's a blessing in the sense that like,
[02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:54.240]   you know, failing would have been fairly predictable.
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:54.800]   - Right.
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:57.600]   - Whereas if like, you know, I always wonder,
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:58.960]   I mean, I think of these like,
[02:53:58.960 --> 02:53:59.920]   especially the big sports,
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:02.000]   like baseball, football, and basketball,
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:05.040]   and you get, you know, guys who,
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:06.960]   guys and girls who are like identified
[02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:10.240]   in like early high school as being the next.
[02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:13.440]   And it's like, what kind of pressure is that
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:16.480]   to think like, well, if I'm not like literally
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:18.640]   one of the best players in the NBA in 10 years,
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:19.200]   I failed.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:19.680]   - Yeah.
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:21.280]   - It's just mind boggling to think
[02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:22.640]   if I'm not one of the best
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:25.440]   at one of the most competitive sports on the planet
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:26.480]   in what is an athletic,
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:29.840]   I think an athletic state of an NBA basketball player
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:31.680]   is probably one of the most athletic human beings
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:32.240]   on the planet.
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:35.680]   And to know like in a teenage year
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:39.520]   that your success bar is being the best,
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:41.840]   one of the best in the league or the best ever.
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:43.760]   And that conversation is floating around
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:45.200]   everywhere you look and see
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:47.600]   versus being able to kind of quietly fail
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:48.560]   and go back to teaching.
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:48.880]   (laughing)
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:51.120]   It makes it a little more digestible, I think.
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:53.280]   - You have a little bit more freedom to be great.
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:53.520]   - Right.
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:55.280]   - Because nobody's expecting you to be great.
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:56.560]   (laughing)
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:58.720]   Is there, from that, is there advice
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:00.720]   you can give to young people today,
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:03.040]   high schoolers, college students,
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:06.000]   taking on, trying to figure out their career,
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:07.200]   trying to figure out their life,
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:10.560]   advice on how to succeed in either?
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:12.000]   - Yeah, I think, you know,
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.680]   one thing I was always interested
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:14.720]   when I was teaching was like,
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:16.480]   you'd have these, you'd have students
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:18.560]   who had like interests,
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:19.600]   they had what they were good at.
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:22.640]   And sometimes those ran in unison with one another.
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:23.440]   Other times they didn't.
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:25.600]   And it was always interesting to me
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:27.040]   when you'd have a student who's like,
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.000]   I'm really into like, you know, guitar
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:31.280]   or I'm really into skateboarding
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:32.000]   or something like that,
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.480]   where it's like pretty small,
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:36.240]   like success rate on that avenue
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:38.240]   versus what you can maybe accomplish
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:39.680]   by focusing on just something
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:40.880]   like a little more standard.
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:43.680]   And I think like, really like,
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:46.640]   besides the likelihood of it becoming
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:49.600]   something you can turn into a profession or not,
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:51.120]   you should just ask yourself, like,
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:53.040]   is this something that I wanna spend
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:54.880]   my free time doing?
[02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:57.200]   And 'cause if it is,
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:58.960]   then you wanna keep that in your life
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:00.880]   'cause that's something that's rewarding, motivating.
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:02.080]   It might be the catalyst
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:03.360]   that gets you out of bed in the morning
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:04.880]   and go to another job
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:06.560]   in order to go do that thing afterwards.
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:08.880]   And I think nowadays,
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:10.480]   we're getting to a point where like,
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:15.520]   your reachability from even a really small,
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.920]   like unmonetized thing previously
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.120]   is now an option where if like you live in a city
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:24.240]   where there's only two other people
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:25.680]   interested in your topic of area,
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:27.760]   so you're not gonna be able to turn into a job now
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:28.720]   with the internet,
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:30.320]   you have the world at your disposal.
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:32.160]   So that two to three people in every town
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:34.080]   can turn into thousands,
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:36.000]   tens of thousands, hundreds of millions of people.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.080]   And if you really focus your time and energy
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:38.720]   into that thing,
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:40.720]   then who knows where you can go
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:42.320]   and how much more enjoyable your life can be
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:43.520]   if you're able to turn your career
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:44.640]   into a passion of yours.
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:46.160]   So I think like,
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:49.280]   that is something I would tell people,
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:50.880]   focus on that.
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:52.640]   - See the thing you're good at
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:54.960]   and it kind of sparks that flame
[02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:57.200]   and go with that,
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.040]   even if society doesn't really want you to,
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:01.760]   like it's non-traditional
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:06.080]   and the odds are low of like traditionally defined success.
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:08.160]   Just do that thing.
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:09.040]   I've struggled with that.
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:10.400]   It's like, it was always clear,
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:12.480]   especially like in school,
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:14.240]   there's stuff I'm actually good at
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:16.000]   and stuff that the world wants me to do.
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:16.880]   - Right, yeah.
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:17.360]   - And I kept doing that.
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:18.480]   - The world wanted me to be a plumber
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:19.920]   when I took that test my sophomore year.
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:20.420]   (laughing)
[02:57:20.420 --> 02:57:20.920]   - Yeah, right.
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:23.600]   But even like academically,
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:26.400]   just going to university and academia,
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.080]   there are certain ways,
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:30.480]   even in, I would say,
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:32.960]   even in the thing you want to do,
[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:34.560]   the way you do that thing,
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:36.560]   the world will want you to do it a certain way.
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:40.560]   And even just like finding your way of doing that thing
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:42.400]   is really powerful.
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.800]   Like for me, the way I do research,
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:50.160]   the way I learn is different than colleagues of mine.
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:51.440]   And I've realized that,
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:54.720]   that I really like to follow things I'm passionate about
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:57:56.800]   versus sort of the rigor of studying
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:59.120]   like the fundamentals all across the board
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.480]   and building up in CASEL
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:04.080]   on the fundamentals, like layer upon layer.
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:05.600]   It's just, there's a bunch of details
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:09.200]   in the way I pursue the very thing that I currently do
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:10.640]   that's different than others.
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:12.560]   And it took me quite a long time to accept
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:14.000]   like you don't need to do it
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:15.440]   the way everyone else is doing it.
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:16.880]   It doesn't, not everyone else,
[02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:19.120]   but majority of people are telling you to do it
[02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:21.280]   'cause one, it's beneficial to do it different
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:23.520]   'cause then you'll more likely stand out.
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:26.000]   And two, like why the hell are you doing it
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:27.440]   the way it's not working for you?
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:29.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:32.080]   You know, I saw that all the time when I was teaching.
[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:33.280]   I was dual certified.
[02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:36.160]   I was, my certifications were in history
[02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:37.440]   and broad field social studies.
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:42.560]   So like econ, psychology, history, all that stuff.
[02:58:42.560 --> 02:58:44.800]   And then I also had a certification of special education,
[02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:47.520]   which was, you know, people think of special education
[02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:49.680]   a lot of times as like, oh, it's the, you know,
[02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:52.000]   the kid who is not smart enough to do the regular thing.
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:55.040]   When in reality, it's like, I mean, there is some,
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:57.280]   you know, there's obviously like, you know,
[02:58:57.280 --> 02:58:59.920]   like certain things like Down syndrome and stuff like that.
[02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:02.720]   But like, there's also like a huge population of groups
[02:59:02.720 --> 02:59:05.760]   of both like gifted and talented on one end of the spectrum
[02:59:05.760 --> 02:59:09.840]   where they're incredibly smart and they're like the geniuses.
[02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:12.800]   But for whatever reason, the standard method of learning
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:14.560]   does not click with them, does not work with them.
[02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:17.440]   And then they just need a slightly different path
[02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:19.040]   or maybe a drastically different path
[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:20.800]   and they're gonna just flourish.
[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:23.200]   And you have kids that end up falling on the other end
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:26.960]   where, you know, maybe it's really difficult for them
[02:59:26.960 --> 02:59:29.840]   to be able to read at the speed of other students.
[02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:32.720]   But if you give them this specific direction,
[02:59:32.720 --> 02:59:34.800]   they can just thrive in a certain area.
[02:59:34.800 --> 02:59:38.480]   And just seeing that like, you know,
[02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:40.480]   that there's multiple ways to do stuff
[02:59:40.480 --> 02:59:42.480]   and there's not necessarily one path to the end
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:45.520]   is I think such an eye-opening thing to learn,
[02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:46.160]   especially if you learn,
[02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:47.840]   maybe that's what I should answer the question
[02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:49.520]   that you've asked me with is, you know,
[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:52.000]   keep an open mind as to what paths are forward
[02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.320]   and know that, you know, maybe just because,
[02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:57.040]   even if you look to your left, you look to your right
[02:59:57.040 --> 02:59:58.960]   and all your classmates are successful doing it one way,
[02:59:58.960 --> 02:59:59.680]   it doesn't necessarily mean
[02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:00.720]   that's gonna be the way for you.
[03:00:00.720 --> 03:00:04.480]   - Yeah, so that could land you in eating a meat-based diet
[03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:05.600]   running across the country.
[03:00:05.600 --> 03:00:10.640]   Like the incredible madman that you are, Zach.
[03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:12.800]   I'm a huge fan, as I've told you many times,
[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:14.560]   you're an inspiration to many.
[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:16.400]   I'll be there checking in every day
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:18.480]   if you somehow make it out the starting line
[03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:19.840]   on September 1st.
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:23.200]   I know Joe Rogan and millions of others will be as well.
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.600]   So I'm excited to see all the suffering
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:26.400]   that you're gonna go through.
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:27.520]   I wish you the best of luck
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:29.280]   and thank you so much for talking today.
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:30.480]   I really, really appreciate it.
[03:00:30.480 --> 03:00:31.520]   - Well, thanks a bunch, Lex.
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:33.760]   It's been an honor to come on your podcast.
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:36.480]   I've been a fan of it for quite some time
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:38.880]   and I thought about wearing a white suit,
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:41.360]   but Michael Malice already took care of that one.
[03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:42.080]   So it was off the--
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:42.880]   (laughing)
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:45.600]   - Well, and I think it would be really good
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:47.360]   for the ratings of this conversation
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:48.960]   if you end up dying during that run.
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:49.920]   So-- (laughing)
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:50.720]   - I'll do my best.
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:52.400]   - So everything that could happen,
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:54.160]   it will be positive for the world.
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:55.200]   (laughing)
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:56.240]   - So you're saying I should try to average
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:56.960]   100 miles a day.
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:00:57.840]   - 100 miles.
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:00:58.400]   (laughing)
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:00.240]   Well, I think you're gonna push yourself to,
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:02.560]   again, it's not the main priority,
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:05.440]   but it's trying to beat that record.
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:07.360]   That's probably gonna take everything you have
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:09.840]   and that's truly inspiring.
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:10.960]   I wish you the best of luck, man.
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:11.760]   - Thanks a bunch.
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:15.680]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Zach Bitter.
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:20.720]   And thank you to Ladder, Belcampo, Noom, and BetterHelp.
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:23.440]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:26.240]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:28.080]   from Steve Prefontaine.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:31.600]   "I'm going to work so that it's a pure guts race at the end.
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:34.640]   "And if it is, I'm the only one who can win it."
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:38.400]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:41.860]   (upbeat music)
[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:44.440]   (upbeat music)
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:46.500]   you
