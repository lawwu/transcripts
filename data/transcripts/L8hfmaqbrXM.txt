[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   Continuing our studies in this ninth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, let us read
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920]   this evening from verse 18 to verse 24.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.040]   From verse 18 to verse 24 in the ninth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, "Therefore hath
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hearteneth."
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.280]   "Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault?
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.720]   For who hath resisted his will?
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   Nay, but, O men, who art thou that replyest against God?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.800]   Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.560]   Hath not the potter power over the clay, Of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.000]   And another unto dishonour?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   What if God, willing to show his wrath, And to make his power known, Endured with much
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.520]   longsuffering the vessels of wrath, Fitted to destruction?
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520]   And that he might make known the riches of his glory, And the vessels of mercy, which
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:28.160]   he had aforeprepared unto glory, Even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only, But also
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   of the Gentiles."
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:38.800]   Now, last Friday evening we were dealing with the argument in the seventeenth verse, where
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:48.920]   the apostle deals with the second case which he puts forward to answer the objection that
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.880]   he had put before us in verse forty.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.520]   The objection was, "What shall we say then?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.280]   Is there unrighteousness with God?"
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.360]   Because that is, that he has said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   He answers that, as we have seen, by putting forward two cases.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.760]   And the second case, in order to demonstrate and to establish this principle that God hated
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   Esau, while Jacob and Esau were still unborn in their mother's womb, he demonstrates that
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.400]   in terms of the case of Pharaoh.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.000]   For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, "Even for this purpose have I raised thee up, that
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.640]   I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   earth."
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.880]   Now, we considered the essence of that statement.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:50.440]   We saw that it really means that God had produced Pharaoh, or caused him to stand in history
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.880]   at that particular point and juncture, in order that he might use him to his own honor
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.120]   and glory.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.040]   We explained that it does not mean that God had created Pharaoh in order that he might
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040]   do that.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.520]   But God, taking Pharaoh as he was, a sinner and an unbeliever, God hardened his heart
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.200]   for his own eternal purpose.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.640]   And we ended by considering some of the ways in which God does harden the hearts of sinful,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.200]   evil, unbelieving men.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.920]   We took illustrations from the scripture to show this very thing.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.320]   Well, then, having said all that, the apostle sums it up in verse 18.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.840]   And in verse 18, I remind you again, he sums up his two cases.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   The case for saying that God can have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and secondly,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.320]   that he will harden whom he will harden.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.840]   So he just puts it as a general conclusion, "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.600]   mercy, and equally whom he will he hardness."
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:12.960]   Now, that means this, that God is free to carry out his own sovereign will in his own
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.080]   way and whenever he pleases and chooses.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.640]   But you see, the teaching can be put like this.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   It's there implicit, really, in that seventeenth verse.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:37.800]   God is over all, and being almighty and all-powerful and sovereign, he can even use evil to display
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.240]   his own glory.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.640]   And what the apostle is really saying in that seventeenth verse is that God used Pharaoh
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   in that way in order to show his own glory.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.600]   God hardened the heart of Pharaoh.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   We established that point.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   It isn't that he merely allowed Pharaoh to harden his own heart.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.800]   The book of Exodus with the history tells us the two things, that God hardened the heart
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.840]   of Pharaoh and that Pharaoh hardened his own heart.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.440]   And I explained to you how the two things were true.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.160]   Now then, what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.920]   Not of course that God made Pharaoh a sinner.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.620]   That doesn't come into it at all.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.880]   God took Pharaoh as he was and aggravated and accentuated what he was in order to serve
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   his own purpose.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   And what was the purpose?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.720]   Well, it was, says the apostle, that he might show forth his power.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   He told Pharaoh that he was doing that.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   How did that happen?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.400]   Well, you see, it happened in this way.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:47.540]   Let's imagine that the first time Moses and Aaron appeared before Pharaoh, asking
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.460]   him to allow the children of Israel to go and to go back to their own land, let's
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.620]   imagine that the very first time they made the request that Pharaoh had given them and
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.660]   had allowed them to go.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.380]   Well, it probably would be something that would just be recorded in history as something
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.460]   that had taken place but no more.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.420]   But you see, that isn't the way in which it happened.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.820]   The way in which it happened was this, that Pharaoh refused.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.980]   And because he refused, God worked a miracle in order to humble him.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.380]   He refused again, and there was another miracle, and he refused again, and there was another
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.380]   miracle.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.220]   You can read the accounts of all these in the book of Exodus for yourselves, and it's
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.180]   important that you should do so.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.420]   Now what the apostle here is saying is this, that God did that and did it in that way.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:47.500]   He increased this obduracy and resistance and evil in Pharaoh in order that through
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:55.260]   that he might give this tremendous signal demonstration of his power and of his lordship.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.500]   Pharaoh, of course, was a great dictator, a mighty emperor with great armies, one of
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.900]   the world conquerors of that time.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.260]   But you see, he's utterly humble, humble to such an extent that at last, against his
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.640]   will entirely, he has to give in and to allow the children of Israel to go.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   So what the apostle is saying is this, that God hardened the heart of Pharaoh in order
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.020]   that through that and in that way he might do this thing.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.900]   For this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.900]   And he did show it.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.940]   You remember that up to a point the magicians of Egypt could reproduce the miracles that
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.780]   were worked by Moses and Aaron and their rod, but a point came when they couldn't.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.420]   And thus all human greatness and human self-confidence was humbled to the dust, and even the might
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.740]   and the power of Pharaoh himself.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.700]   That my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.900]   And it was, of course.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.860]   You read these historical books and you'll find that when the children of Israel were
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.460]   passing through various countries and when they arrived in the land of Canaan, the people
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.460]   there began to tremble.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.200]   They said, "These people have arrived, who were delivered by their God out of the bondage
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.540]   and the captivity of Egypt.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.700]   This is the mighty God that crushed Pharaoh and his hosts and his chariots in the Red
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.700]   Sea."
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   And they were all trembling.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:35.780]   Thus, you see, by hardening Pharaoh's heart, by increasing his resistance, God was able
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.980]   to give this tremendous display of his almighty power.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.860]   It became known, he says, throughout all the earth.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.540]   And here it is in the Scripture.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.300]   And it has been known ever since throughout the world, wherever this history is known
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.300]   amongst men.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:58.420]   Well, now then, there is the statement which the apostle makes, that God in his sovereign
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:04.180]   greatness and glory can even use an evil man like Pharaoh and can harden his heart in order
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:11.140]   that through that and by means of that his glory and his power and his name may be declared
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.820]   throughout all the earth.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:19.740]   So he sums it up, you see, in verse 18 by saying, "Therefore, he hath mercy on whom
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.460]   he will have mercy.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:29.700]   He saves those whom he chooses to save, but at the same time and equally so he hardens
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.820]   those whom he chooses to harden, people like Pharaoh and all who belong to that company.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.660]   And he is free in his sovereign power and glory to do that."
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.660]   Very well.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.860]   Now then, having said that, you see, he goes on to verse 19.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.980]   And here he raises an objection.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.740]   Now you will remember that in our subdivision of this matter a few weeks ago I indicated
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:03.940]   that verses 19 to 24 constitute a new section, a subsection of the main argument.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.780]   It is a general argument.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.540]   Now, we must carry all this in our minds.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.780]   The general argument of the whole chapter and of chapters 10 and 11 in addition is this.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.700]   The apostle having stated so clearly in chapter 8 that God has got a great eternal purpose
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.420]   and that nothing can frustrate it.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.660]   The assurance which every Christian should have about his ultimate glorification is an
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.180]   absolute one.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.700]   Nothing, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers, etc., etc.,
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.180]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.180]   It is absolute.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.020]   But wait a minute, says somebody.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.660]   What about the case of the Jews?
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.540]   God gave promises to them, but look at them.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.540]   They are outside the kingdom.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.900]   They are rejecting the gospel.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.540]   Has not God's word fallen down?
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.540]   Or as the translation here in the Authorized, in verse 6, "Not as though the word of God
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.180]   hath taken none effect."
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.780]   He says that is not the case at all.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.580]   So here now he is showing how, though the Jews at that moment were outside the kingdom
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.780]   and were the most bitter opponents of the Christian faith, the purpose of God is still
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.780]   sure.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.580]   It is still going on.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:24.340]   And the great argument is this, that not all are Israel who are of Israel.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.020]   That is the fundamental proposition.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.980]   They are not all Israel which are of Israel.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.780]   Israel is a special spiritual people.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.700]   Inside the visible Israel, these are the seed.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.220]   Not your Ishmael's, but your Isaac's.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.780]   Not your Esau's, your Jacob's.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:50.980]   And all this is something that God works out by his great process of election.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.460]   There it is in verse 11, that the purpose of God according to election, the purpose
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:01.620]   of God which is carried out by the principle of selection, might stand.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.220]   And it will stand.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220]   And it will never fail.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.300]   Very well, he says, that is the way in which God is doing this.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.700]   And then, as I say, he puts up the objection in verse 14 and he has dealt with it in two
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   cases.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.360]   But, having dealt with it in that way, here again you see arises another objection.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.060]   And it is this, as I am saying, that introduces a further subsection in this main general
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.060]   argument.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:37.340]   Very well, the objection is something like this.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:45.100]   Why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:56.420]   Now, the apostle puts up that objection which, being translated, can be put in this form.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:03.740]   Who can resist or stand up against and continue to stand up against the will of God?
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.020]   The answer is nobody.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.660]   Very well then, why does God save some and punish others?
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.660]   Is it fair?
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.260]   Is it right?
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:19.220]   As God ultimately cannot be resisted, as no one can go on doing that, well then, is it
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.220]   right?
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.220]   Is it fair?
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   Is it just on God's part to punish unbelief and to give salvation to those who do believe?
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:35.860]   Now, here, of course, we are face to face with the common argument, the one most frequently
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.940]   brought against the whole doctrine of election and predestination.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.860]   And that is the thing with which the apostle deals here.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.340]   Now, let us notice some general points.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:55.820]   Let me make some general comments as we come to look at this most important matter.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.940]   The first thing, the first comment which I make is this.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:06.140]   This objection is, of course, a proof that our exposition of the previous passages is
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:16.980]   the right one, and that Paul is teaching in the previous passages that God, and God alone,
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.740]   determines the salvation of every man.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.780]   A man is saved because God has chosen him to salvation.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.980]   He shows mercy to whom he will show mercy, and whom he wills he heartens.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.540]   "Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated."
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.300]   And that remember before either of them was born.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.180]   That is what he has been telling us.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.300]   It is entirely of God.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.980]   It is entirely of him that calleth, not of works, but of him that calleth.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.540]   Verse 11.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:52.740]   Now, this objection, I say, proves to the hilt that that is what the apostle is saying.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.580]   I have to repeat this because, you know, as I have reminded you, there are people who
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:02.060]   try to get out of this difficulty by saying, "Ah, of course, no problem there at all.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.260]   What it really means is that God being omniscient and seeing all the end from the beginning,
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.900]   he knows that certain people are going to believe when they hear the gospel.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.680]   So he chooses them because he knows they are going to believe.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.700]   He knows the others are not going to believe, and therefore he heartens them.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:24.040]   But you see, it cannot mean that, and it cannot mean that for this reason, that nobody would
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.580]   take any objection to that.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.740]   Everybody would say, "Quite right too.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.300]   Here are two men sitting in the same seat.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.820]   They hear the same gospel.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.180]   One believes and is saved.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.860]   The other does not believe and is lost.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.060]   All right, quite fair.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.580]   They both have the same chance.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.660]   One decided to believe, one decided not to.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.260]   Nobody would have any complaint at all.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.820]   There would be no objection to deal with.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.340]   Everybody would feel that is perfectly just, that is perfectly fair.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.380]   But people object to the teaching of the apostle.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.660]   They say, "Why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will?"
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:04.700]   So you see, this objection does surely prove beyond any doubt whatsoever that the apostle
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:11.460]   has been teaching that salvation is entirely the result of the sovereign will and election
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.280]   of God, and nothing to do with us at all.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.640]   Not any merit in us, not our belief, not our faith, not our anything.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.940]   It is entirely and only of God who calls.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.220]   It proves that.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.900]   Secondly, my second comment is this, that there is nothing new in this objection to
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.900]   this doctrine.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.900]   This is not a twentieth-century objection.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.180]   They were objecting to the same doctrine in the first century.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.340]   They have been objecting to it ever since.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.540]   It has got nothing to do with modern learning, modern knowledge, modern science, nothing
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   at all.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.540]   Let us get rid of that.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.700]   We are not being clever nor modern when we argue against this.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.380]   People have always done it.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:02.380]   Thirdly, we cannot but comment on the honesty and the thoroughness of the great apostle.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.540]   He raises the problem.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.700]   He puts it before us.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.460]   Before you ever thought of this objection, he has put it into your mouth.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.940]   I say this in order that we may thank God for the scriptures.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.980]   There is nothing that men can ever think of but that it has already been dealt with and
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.220]   answered here.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.100]   The trouble with people who argue against Christian doctrine is that they do not know
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.020]   their Bibles.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.780]   If they only knew their Bibles, they would say much less.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.260]   Most of what they say has already been answered.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.220]   The apostle has already dealt with it.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.800]   His honesty and his thoroughness, the scriptures are truly marvelous.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.460]   This is the word of God.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.500]   And then my fourth general point is this, of course.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:53.900]   To reject this doctrine of his is not to reject the teaching of the apostle Paul, but it is
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:18:00.980]   to reject what is plainly and clearly taught in the scriptures, which is a most solemn
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.460]   and serious matter.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.780]   I reminded you in passing last Friday night that people are so liable to say, "But that's
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.780]   only Paul.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.900]   That's only Paul's opinion."
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.220]   But you must not say that.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.980]   This man is an inspired apostle.
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.540]   You have got to accept all his teaching if you really believe in the inspiration of the
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.300]   word of God.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:27.060]   If you agree with Peter that what Paul writes is scripture, many things in it are hard to
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.060]   be understood.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.620]   I agree, but remember he calls it the scripture.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.180]   Let's be careful, my friends.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.380]   You are not disagreeing with the apostle Paul.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.980]   Very well.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.020]   Now then, there are some general comments.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.460]   Well, then what is the problem?
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.780]   What is the problem that the apostle raises here and puts before us?
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.340]   Well, the common way to put it is this.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:56.100]   How can we reconcile the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man?
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:02.860]   Doesn't this teaching of the apostle seem to be doing away with man's responsibility?
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:10.300]   Is there any way of reconciling the sovereignty of God and human responsibility?
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.420]   Others of course have put it in a very blunt and bold way by saying this, that this teaching
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.940]   of the apostle is nothing but sheer fatalism.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:28.460]   He is teaching nothing but a doctrine of necessity, that man is just as it were a machine, or
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:39.020]   that he is so bound by some rigid, deterministic fate that what happens to him happens of necessity.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.020]   It is fatalism of necessity.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.780]   Very well, there is the problem, there is the case.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:49.340]   Now then, let us proceed to observe the way in which the great apostle deals with it.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.380]   Now this is most important.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.900]   There is no need for me to say that the passage we are looking at is a most important one.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.820]   It is a classic statement.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:04.180]   It is one about which men have argued and debated throughout the centuries, but it is
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.820]   most important for this reason.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:12.580]   It seems to me that it clears up many peculiar popular misconceptions and prejudices if
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.100]   we only pay attention to what it says.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:25.460]   This passage shows us how far we can go in this matter of understanding God's ways.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:32.140]   It shows us how far we are meant to go, and we need to be shown that.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:41.980]   It does show us, I say, how far we can go, but it shows us the sign which says no further.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:47.780]   And at the same time, I think I should be able to show you that it does teach us the
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:58.060]   relationship of God's sovereignty and man's responsibility, giving equal weight to both.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.380]   And of course, as we go on to the end of the chapter and come on to chapter ten, we shall
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.540]   see the emphasis mainly on man's responsibility.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.820]   Here in this section we are dealing with, the great emphasis is on God's sovereignty.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.620]   He emphasizes both the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of men.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:25.860]   And then we shall see how these two great matters are dealt with by the apostle.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.500]   Very well, what is his actual reply?
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:36.700]   Well, now, again, in order to clarify our thinking, let me subdivide his statement.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:42.500]   Let me give you now a subdivision of verses twenty to twenty-four.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.540]   It is quite simple.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.340]   The first subdivision is in the first part of verse twenty.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.180]   "Nay, but, O men, who art thou that replyest against God?"
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.500]   That is a rebuke to the questioner.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:04.140]   Then the second half of verse twenty and the whole of verse twenty-one are given to an
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:11.780]   explanation of the apostle's assertion of God's sovereignty and entire freedom in what
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:23.980]   he does with foreign humanity as regards saving and cursing, showing wrath or harboring.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:36.260]   Then verses twenty-two to twenty-four show us God's object and purpose in doing this.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:43.940]   Verse twenty-two shows God's object and purpose in the manifestation of his wrath.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.820]   Verses twenty-three and twenty-four show God's object and purpose in the manifestation of
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   his mercy.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.260]   Now then, there it is, quite simply divided up.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.060]   Here is the question.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.540]   Why does he yet find fault in view of the fact that nobody can go on resisting his will?
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.700]   Rebuke to the questioner?
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:18.260]   An assertion of God's absolute freedom in his sovereignty, in showing mercy and in manifesting
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.820]   his wrath.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:28.460]   And then, in order to help us, an explanation proffered with regard to his reason for showing
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:35.660]   the wrath and the cursing, and his reason also for showing the mercy and the compassion
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.500]   and bringing about the salvation.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.860]   Very well, there is the analysis of the argument.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:49.340]   Now having done that, we can proceed to a detailed consideration.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.260]   And here the main thing, I think you will find, is this.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:24:00.140]   The absolute importance of observing the terms which the apostle uses.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.140]   Half the trouble with this passage arises because people take the terms or the words
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.820]   at their face value without examining them, without discovering what they are really saying,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.180]   and they go off at a tangent.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.300]   Let's watch what the apostle says.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   Let's pay great attention to detail.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.940]   Now then, how does he do it?
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:24.420]   Well I say the first thing he does is to rebuke the questioner, and rebuke the questioner.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.060]   Before he deals with the argument, he administers this rebuke.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:33.660]   Nay, but, O man, who art thou that replyest against God?
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.900]   This is the most interesting and most important point.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.740]   What is he rebuking here?
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.940]   Well, he is rebuking the spirit in which the question is put.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.340]   That's what he is rebuking.
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.540]   And this is something that is always vital.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:58.540]   We need to be reminded that in looking at and discussing a subject such as this, we
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:05.940]   are not just looking at a subject of abstract, academic, or theoretical philosophy.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:13.780]   We are not just looking here into some human opinions, or human thoughts, or human argumentation.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:19.260]   You don't approach a subject like this as you approach the subject of the common market,
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.180]   which is purely a matter of human opinion.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.700]   We are in a different realm.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.820]   That's virtually what he is saying.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.420]   But watch the way in which he says this.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.380]   Let's see how he brings out this element of rebuke.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.980]   Nay, but, he says, which means, surely.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.060]   Nay, surely.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.580]   He expresses his surprise, his astonishment.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:51.220]   And then notice this word, "replyest against God."
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:57.060]   Now that word "replyest" is a most interesting one and a most important one.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:06.740]   To reply means, the word used, which is translated "reply," means to answer by contradicting.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.060]   It means replying against.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.380]   There is a prefix to the word which introduces this notion of "against," so that it's
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.660]   actually a matter of contradicting.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:25.660]   The authorities say that the word is used in order to indicate a spirit of contention.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.140]   Now that's the whole point.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:34.980]   What the apostle is rebuking here is the spirit of contention.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:41.620]   He is not rebuking a man who is in a genuine difficulty and who really wants light and
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.940]   wants help and wants understanding.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.220]   The Bible never rebukes that.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.580]   The Bible has never got anything to say against a genuine perplexity and difficulty.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:58.940]   But what it is so very concerned about is the inquiry and the form in which it's made.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:05.860]   You see, this is an objector who stands up to God, as it were, and who contradicts.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.300]   Here is a man who is displaying a wrong spirit.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.540]   Here is somebody who is immediately suggesting that God is unjust.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.780]   Why does he yet find fault?
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.380]   You see it in the question and you hear it in the accent, don't you?
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.860]   The questioner says, "This is all wrong, as nobody can stand up against God.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.780]   What right then has God to punish anybody?
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.820]   What right has God to harden any heart or to hate anybody or to send him to hell?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.820]   The thing is unjust."
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:35.500]   Now then, that's the thing that the apostle is rebuking.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.300]   So you see, my dear friends, as I've been trying to say every single Friday night, we've
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.100]   been dealing with this great subject.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.700]   Nothing is more important here than your spirit.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:52.020]   That's the thing the apostle starts with, and it's absolutely essential and absolutely
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.500]   vital.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:04.980]   We have no right to go on considering this matter at all, unless our spirits are right.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:10.140]   If we take up this attitude towards God of contradicting him, or imputing unworthiness
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:17.860]   to him, or suggesting that he's unjust, already our spirit is wrong, and we cannot hope to
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.580]   be right in our understanding of the teaching anyway.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:28.300]   Very well, notice the way in which the apostle administers the rebuke.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.460]   It's most dramatic, it's most striking.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:47.340]   "Nay, but, O man, who art thou that replyest against God?"
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.340]   You see the contrast?
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.220]   Man, God.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.900]   This tremendous and terrible contrast.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:02.060]   "Wait a moment," says the apostle, "before I begin to consider what you have just said,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.980]   and the point of view which you've adopted, let me just for a moment remind you as to
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.620]   who you are.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.860]   Before we come to consider the argument, just wait a moment.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.860]   Who are you?
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.860]   Who art thou?
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.860]   Man!
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.140]   And you are standing up against and replying against and contradicting.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.940]   Not me, not another man, but God."
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.540]   Oh, you see, this is what matters.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.940]   This is always the cause of our trouble, isn't it, with the biblical truth.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:41.300]   We begin to speak before we stop to consider who we are and our right to speak.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.220]   We take up the cudgels and we take up our position and we speak with feeling.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.260]   God have mercy upon us.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.220]   We don't realize what we are doing.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.780]   The trouble with men, when he objects with violence to any teaching in the Scripture,
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.460]   is that he doesn't realize the truth about himself.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.380]   Who art thou?
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:08.580]   Realize your smallness, realize your insignificance, realize your finite character, realize your
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:14.660]   mortality, realize your sinfulness, realize your perversion, realize the smallness of
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.700]   your mind and understanding.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.180]   Who art thou, O men?
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.780]   Try and inculcate in yourself and develop the spirit of the psalmist in the eighth verse,
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.860]   who looks at himself and says, "What is man?"
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.620]   That thou art mindful of him.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.380]   That's the contrast.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.460]   Who art thou?
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.860]   And the other man, what is man?
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:44.140]   Now that's the Scripture speaking to two different men, to the self-confident man who
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.300]   stands up full of his twentieth-century knowledge, the great philosopher who is examining God
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.300]   and his ways.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.300]   Who art thou?
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   But there's the humble believer, looking up into the heavens, the work of God's hands,
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.300]   and who says, "What is man?"
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:07.860]   That thou art mindful of him, O son of man, that thou visitest him.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.860]   What a contrast.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.860]   Well, here it is.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:13.740]   The thing I say, the trouble with most of us in all our difficulties with biblical truth
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.020]   is that we don't know first the truth about ourselves, and then, of course, the second
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.620]   thing we're ignorant of is the truth about God.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:29.420]   Who art thou, O men, that replyest against God, his greatness, and his glory, and his
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.420]   eternity, and his majesty?
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.900]   Well, now, of course, this is something that is emphasized everywhere in the Bible.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.860]   Let me just give you some examples of it.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.780]   There's no point in proceeding to the detailed argument, as the apostle says, until we are
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.700]   right about this, until your spirit is right.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.820]   You can't discuss this, and it would be wrong to discuss it with you.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.420]   We've got to start where the apostles does.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.780]   Very well, let me give you some illustrations.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.940]   Take what we've already seen about the glory of God.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:02.040]   You remember we had it in the list of things here, the things that characterize the children
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:08.420]   of Israel, who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory, and the giving
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:14.020]   of the law, you remember, in Exodus 19.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.740]   God gave a manifestation of himself to the people.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   Why?
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.020]   Well, in order to put them in the right place and in the right position.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.620]   As if God were saying, "Now I gave you great signs before I brought you out of Egypt, but
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.420]   I know you, and how ready you are to forget them, and to think of yourselves as a nation
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.860]   self-contained.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.940]   I want you to realize who you are, and who I am, who have called you out of Egypt, and
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.100]   who are taking you into Canaan."
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.060]   And he gave them a manifestation of his glory, the mount burning with fire, and so on.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.540]   The glory.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.620]   And the object of that was to humble these people, that they might walk obediently and
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.780]   quietly with their God.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.460]   But that's only one of them.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:03.060]   You see, before God did that to the whole nation, he'd done it to Moses himself personally,
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.780]   and in particular.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.260]   Let me give you the example and the illustration of this.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.340]   It's the most important one.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.500]   Even Moses had to be put right on this.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.540]   Go back to Exodus chapter 3, and let me read you the first five verses.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.940]   "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.860]   And he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and he came to the mountain of God,
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.020]   even to Horeb.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:30.260]   And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:36.260]   He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.260]   Now listen.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:45.260]   "And Moses said, 'I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.900]   not burnt.'"
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.820]   The intellectual modern scientist going to investigate the phenomenon.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:57.420]   "And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:02.980]   of the bush and said, 'Moses, Moses!'
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.260]   And he said, 'Here I am.'
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:14.780]   And he said, 'Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.340]   whereon thou standest is holy ground.'
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:23.780]   Moreover, he said, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abram, the God of Isaac, and the
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.780]   God of Jacob.'
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.220]   And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God."
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.860]   You see the contrast.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.900]   The readiness to investigate, but he's prohibited.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:41.460]   "Take off your shoes from off your feet; the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.460]   Stand back!"
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.060]   You don't investigate this as a man.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.020]   "I, the Lord, am speaking to you.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.580]   I am the God of thy father."
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.540]   Well, now the same thing had to be done even with a man like Joshua, the successor of Moses.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:00.140]   And you'll find that at the end of the fifth chapter of the book of Joshua.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.580]   Here is Joshua at a critical moment.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:11.820]   It came to pass, verse 13 of Joshua 5, "It came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.700]   he lifted up his eyes and looked.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.580]   And behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.700]   And Joshua went unto him and said unto him, 'Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?'
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.700]   And he said, 'Nay, but as the captain of the host of the Lord am I now come.'
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:32.100]   And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship, and said unto him, 'What saith
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.340]   my Lord unto his servant?'
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:40.700]   And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, 'Loose thy shoe from off thy foot,
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.700]   for the place whereon thou standest is holy.'
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.460]   And Joshua did so."
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.860]   He's in the presence of the Lord very well.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.260]   He's got to humble himself and take off his shoes.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.660]   The ground is holy.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.420]   The whole approach has got to be different.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.860]   No longer an investigation, "Are you for us or for the adversary?"
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.180]   Humility, worship, reverence.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.660]   Here it is, even with such men.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.580]   Then go for your next example to the book of Job, where the matter is put before us
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:15.660]   very clearly again in the last chapter, in chapter 42.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.780]   And this, of course, is particularly appropriate for this reason.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.780]   Poor Job.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:27.620]   He was tried by terrible difficulties, and he couldn't understand it.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.780]   He was a good man, he was a godly man, yet he had all these calamities.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.140]   And of course the great book of Job tells us about his complaints, his arguments, and
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.140]   disputations.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.220]   "Oh, that I might be able to state my case to him," says Job.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.700]   "He doesn't give me a chance.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.900]   He's terrorizing me.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.500]   If only I could stand up and state my case."
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.100]   He's gone on doing that, you remember.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.900]   But now here we come to the end of the story, in chapter 42.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.860]   And God has spoken to Job in these previous chapters.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.860]   Read them.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.940]   How God gives a manifestation of himself and his being and his glory to Job.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.940]   He addresses him.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.460]   He says, "Now, I want you to realize the one to whom you've been speaking, against
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.900]   whom you've been bringing your complaints and trying to marshal your arguments."
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:17.900]   "And then Job answered the Lord and said, 'I know that thou canst do everything, and
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.500]   that no thought can be withheld from thee.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.380]   Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.060]   Therefore have I uttered that I understood not.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.580]   Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.860]   Here I beseech thee, and I will speak.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.900]   I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:44.580]   I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:52.740]   Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.'"
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.860]   Poor Job, how he regrets what he'd said in the heat of the moment and in the pain and
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.940]   the agony of his tribulation.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.260]   His questioning of God.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.580]   He's beginning to feel that God was not righteous and that God was not just.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.540]   "Oh, what a fool I've been," he says.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.300]   "I was talking without realizing what I was saying.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.260]   I was speaking in ignorance."
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.380]   That's what a man says when he realizes that he's oppressing God.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:23.620]   "Who art thou, O man, that replyest against God?"
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.620]   But you see, the Bible is full of this sort of thing.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:32.100]   You've got the same thing exactly in Isaiah 6.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.580]   You see, we are not dealing with the argument, are we, my friends?
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.580]   Many of you disappointed.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.180]   Did you hope that at long last I was coming to it?
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:47.180]   No, not until your spirit is right, not until you are fit to hear the argument, not until
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:57.140]   you've got rid of all self-opinion and self-reliance, everything that can be regarded as opinionatedness.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.940]   It's got to be vanished, disappeared.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.860]   We are not fit to consider the doctrine until we get rid of it.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.900]   There it is at the beginning, Isaiah 6 again.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.780]   The vision that was given to him, you remember, it's in the first four verses.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.580]   "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:23.100]   lifted up, and his train filled the temple, and then the seraphim and so on.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:31.900]   Then said I, 'Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:37.300]   dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King, the
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.020]   Lord of hosts.'"
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.940]   That's the attitude.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   That's the right condition.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:49.580]   Or go to Ecclesiastes 5.2, and this is what you'll read, "God is in heaven and thou
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.580]   upon earth."
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   Never forget that.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.420]   "Who art thou, O men?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.260]   God is in heaven and thou upon earth."
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:05.140]   It's the same thing as you get, of course, in the Lord's Prayer.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:12.980]   Before you begin to make any requests of God, you start by realizing who he is.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:18.720]   Before you begin to indulge in your sentimental, sloppy, modern notions about the love of God,
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:26.860]   you say, "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.620]   And then and only then are you entitled to go on.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.620]   Same thing.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:37.940]   "Yes," says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, "we must approach him with
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:45.420]   reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:50.100]   What is being rebuked, you see, is this which the apostle Paul puts in the epistle to the
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:56.460]   Colossians in chapter 2 and in verse 18 in these words, "Let no man beguile you of
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:03.900]   your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:12.180]   he hath not seen, vainly puffed up in his fleshly mind, and not knowing the head from
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:17.620]   which all the body by joints and bends, having nourishment, ministered and knit together,
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.780]   increases with the increase of God."
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.700]   What the apostle is rebuking is this sort of man who intrudes into things which he hasn't
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   seen, vainly puffed up in his fleshy mind.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.900]   Why does he yet find fault as nobody can resist him?
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:38.620]   The fleshy mind brings its argument and the apostle rebukes it immediately.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:47.460]   Well that's the first part of the rebuke, just these words, "Who art thou, O man,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.060]   that replyest against God?"
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:55.900]   Then I must borrow what he goes on to say, it's in the next subsection, but I must
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.260]   bring it in here because it's a part of the rebuke.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.260]   He goes on repeating it.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:12.340]   "Shall the thing formed"—that's what you are—"shall the thing formed say to
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.260]   him that formed it"—you see the contrast?—"man God."
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.060]   The thing formed, interesting word this.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.100]   It's the word from which we get our present word, "plastic."
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.820]   You know all these things they make out of plastic material at the present time.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.020]   That's the very word used there, the thing formed, plasma.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.060]   "And this is what you are," says the apostle, "with your objection, you are only the
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   thing formed, the plastic material.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:46.660]   And God is the one who handles and who forms and who models the plastic material."
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:52.100]   And then to bring it right home to us, he goes on and uses this other comparison, "Hath
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:58.540]   not the potter power over the clay of the same lump?"
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:04.220]   The contrast is between man and God, the thing formed and the one who forms, a lump of clay
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.180]   and the potter.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:14.660]   It's in that way that the apostle then rebukes the spirit in which this question is put.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.860]   This man, who arrogantly gets up and says, "Well, then in that case God isn't fair.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.860]   This is unjust.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.340]   How can he do the two things at the same time?"
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.860]   Thus, this evil spirit is rebuked.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:32.300]   Now, before I let you go tonight, in order that I may complete just this one point, does
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.660]   somebody feel that the apostle's argument is unfair here?
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.840]   Do you feel that he's just browbeating you or trying to bludgeon you?
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.260]   That instead of dealing with your objection and your argument, he attacks you personally
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.860]   and talks about your spirit.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.860]   Is it unfair?
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:53.460]   Well, the answer is that it isn't unfair for this reason.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.540]   The apostle, in what he has been saying in the previous verses, has not just been putting
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.500]   forward his opinion.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:07.900]   What he's been saying is this, "The Scripture saith to Pharaoh, God saith to Pharaoh, it
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.900]   is God whom he's been quoting."
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.100]   So he points out to this clever objector, he says, "Look here, you're not arguing against
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.600]   me.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.100]   You are arguing against God.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:26.600]   I haven't been putting before you," says the apostle, "my own personal theories.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.500]   In each instance, I have given you quotations from the Scripture.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.300]   I have quoted to you that God said, 'Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.'
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.420]   I haven't said that about God, it's God himself who says it about himself.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.500]   And in all my other illustrations," says the apostle, "I have been giving you the word
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.300]   of Scripture, which is the word of God."
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.420]   "Very well then," says the apostle, "when you stand up like that and say, 'Well then,
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.340]   why does he find fault?'
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:01.460]   I just want you to realize that you're not criticizing me.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:06.580]   You are criticizing the Almighty God.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.380]   You're not querying a human opinion.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.180]   You're not merely querying the teaching of some great theologian who has ever lived.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.740]   That isn't what we're doing.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.860]   Here we have the plain teaching of this apostle, and the apostle is quoting the Scriptures,
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:25.060]   he is quoting the word of God, he is divinely inspired on top of it.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:33.300]   So that if you object to this teaching, you are not objecting to the teaching of any man.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:42.980]   You are objecting to the teaching of God himself, concerning God himself.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:49.940]   Therefore all the apostle wants us to realize is this, that we must be very careful in what
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.780]   we say.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:57.260]   You mustn't start to speak about this subject until your attitude is right, until your spirit
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.700]   is right.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.060]   Therefore you need to be told at the very outset, "Who art thou, O man?
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.060]   Realize the truth about yourself.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:10.140]   You are a bit of plastic material, you're nothing else, and you are standing up against
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:15.180]   this great artificer.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.260]   You are nothing but a man, he's God.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:25.980]   If you are on earth, he's in heaven.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:31.020]   Realize this truth about yourself before you go any further.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:38.620]   Remember that you're nothing but a bit of clay in comparison with God, and that he is
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.020]   the potter.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:47.340]   Do we always approach the Scriptures in that way?
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:55.420]   Do we always enter into discussions on this doctrine or any doctrine in that way?
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.300]   Very well, let us from henceforth, whenever we come across anything in the Scripture that
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.060]   is difficult, before we begin to express our opinions, remember the word of the apostle
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:08.660]   to you, "Who are you?"
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.780]   There is only one way to approach the Scripture.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:20.420]   It is to listen to the injunction that God gave to Moses and to Joshua, "Take off the
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.220]   shoes from off your feet.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:29.380]   The ground whereon you are standing is holy ground."
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:36.020]   When you discuss this or any item in the whole of this book, always remember that you are
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:47.060]   discussing the word of God, the revelation of God, and therefore, God himself.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.500]   You mustn't discuss this as you discuss anything else.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.060]   You have a right to your opinion in every other respect, in every other matter, not
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.060]   here.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.740]   Here, you take off your shoes.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.420]   You've got to become as a little child.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.820]   You've got to humble yourself.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:12.540]   And if you don't do so, you must of necessity be wrong in your opinion.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:17.380]   It is only to the humble that God reveals the truth.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.380]   Our Lord said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:27.100]   things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:33.260]   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:44.380]   Who art thou, O man, that replies against God?
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:50.380]   Make certain that our spirits are right, and then we can go on, God willing, next week
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:56.020]   to consider the detailed argument as the apostle puts it before us.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.020]   Let us pray.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:08.420]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy holy presence as Job of old, conscious of our folly and
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:16.260]   our sinfulness and our shame, confessing that many times we have expressed our thoughtless,
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:23.540]   hurried, arrogant opinions about thy most holy and blessed truth and about thee.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:32.900]   O God, forgive us that our attitude has been so sinful, so vile.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:39.140]   Grant us, we pray thee, by thy Spirit, ever to realize thy presence when we touch and
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:44.260]   handle thy word and its most sacred truth.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.580]   Grant unto us that childlike, teachable spirit.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   Grant us to become fools according to the estimation of the world, that we may be made
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:04.100]   wise in a knowledge of thee and thy glorious purpose and thy everlasting name.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.420]   Lord, pardon us and forgive us.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.940]   We therefore pray thee for everything that we have done or said or thought amiss, even
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:16.100]   this very night and in this very meeting.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:24.340]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:31.300]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:39.820]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:47.100]   arrive safely in the glory, saved by grace.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.340]   Amen.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.260]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
