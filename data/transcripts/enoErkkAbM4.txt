[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   I think that ranks top five most traumatic freshman experiences.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.120]   In senior year, you realize, "Oh my gosh, I need to find a job.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.560]   I'm going to move out of this place. Am I going to have friends?"
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.760]   One Christian after another, after we're having a conversation,
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.040]   we're like, "They just are hungry for this training."
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.560]   They have mentors, but then just being able to articulate their faith.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   All right. Hello, and welcome to the official, unofficial AX2Network podcast,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.760]   where we are launching lifelong kingdom workers from every college town.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.960]   I'm Steven. I'm Isaiah.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.120]   And today we are with Ben and Helen.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.680]   Hello.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.320]   Hi.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.360]   Do you guys do this all the time?
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   Do you guys wear matching sweater?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.120]   I just happen to wear the same sweater.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000]   Every third day, because I just rotate through my sweater.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.760]   Is it the AX2Net sweater? Is that what it is?
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.400]   No, no, no.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.200]   No, it's just a sweater.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   Yeah, it's a sweater that we got together.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   That sounded funny.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.040]   at the same time.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.640]   All right.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.560]   Well, we're going to be talking about AX2Net today,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.520]   but before we jump into that, this sort of new ministry that we're exploring,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.480]   just tell us a bit about yourself.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.680]   Why don't you guys introduce yourselves?
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.680]   Maybe what year you graduated, where you graduated from,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.600]   who are some of your peers around our network,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.160]   and what you're doing in ministry right now?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.480]   So, graduated class of 2001, UC Berkeley.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.280]   Some of my peers around the network would be like Dan Chang in Minnesota,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.760]   Henry Chen in Austin, Gary Chang up in Davis,
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.360]   and then I think actually everyone else is here in Berkeley.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.800]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.840]   Cool, cool, yeah.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.600]   Oh, I'm Helen, also class of 2001.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.960]   Some of my friends in the network.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.400]   Chi Sun Choi.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   There's Sarah Chu, who's at UIUC.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.480]   Susan Iskandara, who's at Madison.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.840]   Mia Wong, who's on the East Coast.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.160]   And I think, yeah, the rest are here in California, at least.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.600]   Sandra and Davis.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.000]   And then your younger sister is here.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   She's in Silicon Valley, yeah.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.880]   Cool, yeah.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.360]   All right.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.600]   And then, so, we're kind of, um, we're in the Fit Lit program, which is, uh,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.880]   Leads in training.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.080]   Leads in training, yeah.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.400]   So, one year, we're about six months in, yeah.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.520]   So, we've been here in Berkeley.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.040]   We were in Irvine for four years.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.080]   What were you doing in Irvine?
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.760]   We're leading the youth ministry down there.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.960]   So, that was a lot of fun.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.080]   Can you actually, like, maybe just briefly go over, like, your ministry resume since graduating?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.520]   Like, what were the ministries you should spend?
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.080]   It's long.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.960]   It's, like, 24 years.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.800]   Yeah, tell us a little bit.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.120]   So, um, for me, I, after we graduated, I joined college ministry for a year,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.960]   and then I went on missions for a year.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.440]   Where?
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.600]   I went to Tashkent, which is in Uzbekistan.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.080]   Wow.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.640]   Spent a year there.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.200]   I came back.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   Um, I was part of our practice ministry for a little bit, and then jumped back into college,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.640]   was in college until...
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.320]   Practice is, uh, young adult.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.880]   Right, right.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   Our young adult ministry, post-grad ministry.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.600]   And then, um, 2014,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   Um, we joined our element ministry, which is our youth group,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.560]   here in Berkeley.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.920]   And then we did four years of element, and then we jumped over to...
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.440]   Who are some of the element kids?
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.000]   Oh, boy.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.280]   I remember from this.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.480]   Graduating class, that 12th grade class was Anna King.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.200]   Wow.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   When we first joined, class of 2018.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.760]   Yeah, Amy Lu, Beatrice.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.280]   Oh, yeah, there's a lot of them.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.240]   They're, like, everywhere now.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.960]   They're everywhere.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.680]   Spread out.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   Yeah, many of them doing youth ministry, too.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.920]   And then our last class was Christine Lee.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.880]   Okay.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.840]   Oh, I take that back.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.880]   It was Daniel Choi, so...
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.440]   Oh, Daniel Choi.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.880]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   2022.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   Okay.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.280]   2022, yeah.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.880]   And then we went and we joined that first group that, um, started AYM, Area Youth Ministry.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.600]   So reaching, reaching, reaching youth kids outside.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.400]   Oh, gee.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.040]   Wow.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.160]   Yeah, we got to be part of that.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.440]   That was fun.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.400]   Two years up here in Berkeley, and then we moved down to Irvine and kind of helped, um,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.080]   kind of get more kind of youth ministry traction down there in Southern California.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   I remember when you guys moved to Irvine, like, that was, that was shocking.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.920]   because you guys have been in Berkeley for so long.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.320]   And then Helen was such a crucial part of, like, ASP, life, and then we were all like,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.200]   "Wait, are you guys really moving?"
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah, we're so excited, though.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.880]   We spent all this church training.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.000]   We were like...
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   It was during the pandemic.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.400]   Yeah, we moved in 2020.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.600]   August of 2020.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.360]   We just started.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.560]   So our kids were like, "Yeah, let's go!"
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.760]   "Get me out of here!"
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.640]   "Get me out of here!"
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.560]   Irvine's a better place to move to during the pandemic, but, yeah.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.160]   You guys overlapped in college ministry, right?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.680]   In my senior, oh, we, like...
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.400]   Yeah, your senior year and then the first year out.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.840]   And then we did Kairos, first year out.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.640]   Kairos.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.160]   That was 2012.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   Oh, you were part of Kairos that senior, our senior year?
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.480]   Oh, and you were part of Klaes' that?
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.760]   That's right.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.880]   Goodness.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.080]   That was...
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.040]   That was great.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.600]   It was fun.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.320]   A lot of fun.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.200]   All right, so, um, so, now you've signed up for the Fitlit program, and through that,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.920]   you guys are doing this new thing called Acts 2 Next.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.000]   Wait, wait, are you guys the oldest of the Fitlits?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.480]   We are.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.960]   You are?
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   By just a couple months, because my peer Jen Kim is...
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   One of the Fitlits, I won't say who, but one of the Fitlits that got interviewed on this podcast.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.200]   Okay.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.120]   The only one hour!
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.080]   So that you guys are, like, the mom and dad of, like, you guys are always, like, we're...
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.760]   Well, she's clearly the mom.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.280]   That's her presence, right?
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.040]   I'm just the oldest.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.080]   I'm married to mom, so I must be dad.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.320]   Step dad, I guess.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.960]   It is kind of fun, though, because it's, like, in the Fitlits group, there's, like, these, like, families, you know?
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.280]   So it's, um, there's, like, older couples, and then it's kind of a middle level, and then the young ones.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.560]   It's, like, about a decade, right?
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.800]   Yeah, so the youngest out of the sisters, we're 15 years apart.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.280]   So it's kind of neat being in the Fitlits group.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.160]   15 years apart.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.720]   Wow.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.720]   So for when, like, you've been doing bivocational ministry for a long time.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.560]   Well, tell us the story of, like, how you decided to go full-time at this point in your life.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.920]   Like, how'd you feel when you got the invite and things like that?
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.720]   Well, she really wanted to.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.520]   I wanted to.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.640]   And I actually have been working for a church for, like, I think this is my 16th year.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.200]   When my first child, when he was born, that was the year that I went full-time.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.920]   But for Ben, it was...
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.360]   I was a little bit more resistant.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.280]   I didn't, I didn't think, so my excuse, personally, was I don't think I can cut it.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.920]   And I saw all of our full-time leads and the way they lived, and I just felt like that's not who I am.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.800]   But then when I dug into that, and so I had some conversations with my leaders,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.040]   and I remember feeling like, oh, I just changed jobs, and it's hard to find a job.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.200]   And I had all these kind of, like, surface-level excuses.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.120]   But then when it came down to it, it was kind of like, oh, I don't think I'm ready to surrender.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.160]   You know?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.600]   And that was the key word.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   So, like, even like this past year, as I was thinking about this past year, my key word was,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.400]   God's really challenging me to surrender.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.040]   And in the end, it's not about competence or whether you're cut out for something.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.560]   You know, it's, it's just about whether you're willing to be surrendered or not.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.960]   And then, and so that was kind of the struggle that I went through during that time, had conversations.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.920]   And personally, what really moved me was seeing our foreign mission teams being sent out.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:21.920]   And because I knew some of those people, and I knew some of the challenges that they were facing as they made that decision to go.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.440]   And I was just in tears watching the foreign mission commissioning service.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.360]   And that was right around the time I was, like, deciding, initially, deciding not to do this full-time training program.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.920]   And then I just felt like, man, um, I, I see them surrender and I see their joy.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.240]   And, um, what am I doing?
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.840]   I felt really challenged by that.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.960]   So I kind of struggled with that.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.040]   It was about a week and a half or so of really kind of praying and wrestling with myself and realizing,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.280]   oh boy, that's kind of where I'm at.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.560]   Like, I mean, Irvine is a comfortable city, you know, and, uh,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.200]   And I had a great setup there.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.560]   I loved what I was doing.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.920]   And, um, and then to hear kind of being like, take, to take that next step.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.280]   I think that was really challenging for me.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.680]   And I think, um, different things, conversations happen.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.360]   And I was like, man, that's the proper response at this time for me is, is to go ahead and say yes.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.160]   Wow.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.960]   Thank you for sharing that.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.600]   That's a good word.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.120]   I feel like, I often feel like different points in my life.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.240]   Like God is calling me to a little surrender that I'm not ready for yet.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.120]   Like that's kind of, that's always been, that's kind of been a recurring motif and stuff.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.160]   So, but, um, but, um, before, I mean, let's, let's dive into your,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.360]   both of your stories a little bit.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.120]   Like, um, you know, how'd you come to our church?
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.240]   Um, and, and yeah, what made you stick around?
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.120]   How'd you become Christian?
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.680]   Like all that.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.400]   Spiritual background.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   Yeah, spiritual background a little bit.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.520]   Just, like, it's relevant.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.640]   Sure.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.880]   I, so I, uh, came to our church, um, through an invite.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.280]   Okay.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.080]   Okay.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.240]   So one of my best friends from high school was roommates with Amy Tung, who's also one of
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.040]   my peers.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.600]   Okay.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.440]   And, um, they were roommates.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.240]   So then, and I was a spring admit, so I didn't have-
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   Spring admit meaning you started, your first semester was in the spring semester.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:09.920]   Yes.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.080]   But then I took extension courses in the fall.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   Okay.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.400]   Got it.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.560]   But then I didn't have like housing in the dorms.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.640]   So then I was constantly over at their dorm.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.160]   Um, and so I, I was like church hopping.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.000]   Um, and then Jin Kim, I think he's also one of our peers.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.120]   He had friends on that floor.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.600]   So he had mentioned like, oh, I go, you know, to this church.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.640]   You can, you know, he invited us, but I didn't really go.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.560]   Um, and then, uh, yeah, event, we eventually, um, went with some of our dorm friends, who's
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.720]   also some, he, they go to our church, Henry and Dan were some of our friends from dorms.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.920]   And it was, um, it was freshman year winter.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.120]   Welcome back freshman after the winter break, like a freshman dinner thing.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.920]   Welcome back.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   Welcome back.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.800]   And then we all went like eight of us went, um, with dorm friends.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.960]   And then, um, because we're all dorm friends.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.760]   It's funny.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.960]   Just kind of friends.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.280]   Well, Amy's from Saratoga.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.200]   So like, you know, the connections and then, uh, we went and then we had dinner.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.240]   It was zone C back then, uh, had great dinner.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.880]   And then the post activity was a bowling bonanza.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.760]   And personally, I really love bowling.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   I had my own bowling ball with my name on it.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.080]   Yeah, I was on this father daughter bowling league.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.640]   What?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.680]   You seen a bowling league?
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.640]   Father daughter bowling league.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.600]   Have you seen her bowling?
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.200]   I feel like I've only beaten her once in my league.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.920]   Oh, really?
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.640]   What's your highest score?
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.000]   What's the highest score you've got?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.320]   I forget, like 162 or something like that.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.040]   162?
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.920]   That's pretty good.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.040]   Okay.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.240]   It's more about consistency.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.400]   But, um, anyways, so then everyone was like, ah, I don't know if we're going to stay.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.080]   We're like, okay, Dan Chang, make the decision.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.320]   Are we going to all stay and go bowling?
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.600]   Well, it was like a group decision.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.480]   It was like, yeah.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.280]   And then, Dan wasn't even Christian at that time, right?
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.320]   Dan Chang.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.120]   Yeah, he was not.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.280]   But he was coming out and then secretly inside, I was like, I hope he says yes.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.920]   And then he's like, sure, yeah, let's go.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.880]   So we all went.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.040]   And then it's just, I personally had a blast.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.680]   And the rest of his history, he stayed.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.280]   Wait, so you were church hopping, but I heard you were Mormon.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.920]   I was.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.400]   Is that true?
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.880]   Yes.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.680]   I grew up Mormon.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.120]   But you're church hopping at like Protestant churches?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.840]   Yes.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.280]   So I grew up Mormon.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.080]   My dad was like a missionary and a bishop and everything.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.200]   So we were really involved.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.680]   Wow.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.920]   And then we stopped going my seventh grade year.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.760]   And then didn't go to church for a couple of years.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.520]   And then 10th grade, we followed my aunt, who's a devout Christian.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.080]   She immigrated from Paraguay.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.240]   Came to live with us.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.160]   And we followed her to church, a Presbyterian church.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.760]   So since 10th grade, I did go to like a church.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.720]   And I grew up very, like, goody two-shoes.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.280]   My younger sister was the rebellious one.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.200]   And so even though.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.560]   I feel like we need to have a podcast.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.200]   Yeah, she might need to come and defend herself.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.400]   But so, you know, I did dutifully go to church.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.760]   But I hated my experience.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.320]   So freshman year, I was thinking, okay, I don't need to go to church
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.440]   because my parents are not with me to make me go.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.040]   But then freshman year, my mom called me every Sunday.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.840]   Oh my gosh.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.320]   Wow.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.360]   Are you at church?
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   Oh, did you go to church?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.720]   So then out of guilt, I just needed to find a church.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.200]   Oh wow.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.960]   So that's why I was like church hopping.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.920]   Yeah, so freshman year, that's how I found our church.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.600]   And then started going to the fellowship.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.960]   And then, you know, the church.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.280]   So then how did a goody two-shoes become Christian?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   And even though I didn't like my church experience,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.760]   I called myself Christian.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.400]   So even when we came to our church, I called myself Christian.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.520]   But I was definitely afraid that anyone would ask me about anything about my testimony
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.360]   or anything about Bible or gospel because I didn't know.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.240]   Wow.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   You knew you didn't know.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.680]   Like, that's why you're afraid, I guess.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.040]   And then I think people just assumed, like, oh, she's a good girl, you know,
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.680]   goes to church, must be Christian, you know, kind of thing.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.400]   And I decided to actually stay at our church junior year after mission trip.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.560]   It was our first mission trip to Japan and Korea.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.960]   Is that the really long one?
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.560]   I think like 70 of us went to Japan.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.680]   That sounds fun.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.360]   And with Pastor Ed and Kelly.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.880]   And my first experience, a bunch of my peers went together.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.760]   And I remember coming back like, I could do this for the rest of my life, like with my friends.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.520]   So I think after that, I wanted to stick around.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.760]   Junior year was also when I made a decision to become a real Christian.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.040]   Yeah, because freshman year called myself Christian, but I knew I was a fake.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.480]   And then that's when I took Course 101.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.960]   So sophomore year, I just stopped calling myself a Christian.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   I just asked a lot of questions.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.920]   And it's very brave stuff.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.920]   And I felt really free because I'm like, hey, I don't know.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.280]   And I want to ask a lot of the questions that I've been wanting to ask.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.840]   And then it wasn't until junior year.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.200]   Actually, it's kind of an interesting story.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.920]   Like it was seeing myself as a sinner that I had a really hard time with.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.200]   But then, you know, that's the central thing, you know.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.640]   So then my leader at that time is like, okay, I want you to keep a journal and call it your IT journal.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.240]   Impure thoughts journal.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.360]   She's like, you just for a week.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.720]   I just want you to write every impure thought, everything, like anything.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:44.960]   Wow.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.400]   Be specific.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.080]   And then, so I took that, you know, being the dutiful person that I am.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.840]   Yeah, I feel like most people are like, yeah, I'm good.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.320]   I did that.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:54.720]   Wow.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.680]   And I like made sure no one, you know, got it or anything.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.600]   And then she said, bring that to prayer meeting.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.280]   So I remember very distinctly, First Press, I brought that to prayer meeting.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.560]   She said, I want you to read that and then just pray.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.200]   And I started reading it, like, out loud with my head into the bench.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.680]   And I was like, in tears.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.880]   Because I'm like, I'm a wicked, broken, messed up sinner.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.200]   Wow.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.960]   And I think that's very distinctly when I realized, like, I'm a sinner and I need forgiveness.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.920]   And so, yeah, that was junior year.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:41.440]   And I think that from there, it's just the process of lordship and sanctification, I think, became.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.560]   Wow.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.760]   That reminds me of that, you know.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.720]   Do you still have that journal?
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Can I see?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.920]   I burned that.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   I thought it was worth asking.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.880]   After you can see, just like, symbolically burn it, you know, all paid for.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.640]   I've never heard of an IT journal.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.560]   Was that like a thing that people did back then?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:56.720]   No.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.120]   Or it was just, your leader just came up with that just for you?
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.520]   Like, I guess, I don't know, but.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.560]   It was probably externally.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.960]   Yeah, because you were so good, you needed to do that.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.520]   Wow.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.760]   I mean, it's that whole, you know, imagine if there was a projection of all your thoughts.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.160]   Yes.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.120]   For everyone to see.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.360]   But just a literal exercise of that.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.440]   And she was like, write names, write thoughts, just everything.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.080]   Wow.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.360]   But you actually did it, I think that's.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.400]   That's, yeah.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.200]   That's crazy.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.680]   Wow.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.840]   But how about, how about Ben?
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.360]   Like how did, you know, what's your story?
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.560]   So, um, my parents became Christian when I was two.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.960]   Okay.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.800]   And they were, uh, zealous.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:38.000]   Um, and so I was the kid who grew up in church at church, you know, we're there like
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.640]   every other day, um, all night, you know, whatever, um, for various things.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.320]   I, I, I remember kind of getting cynical about the church towards the end of high school because I,
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.840]   I just kind of started to feel like, oh, it's just the same thing as, as school.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.680]   Like every, it's just a popularity game.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.960]   You know, people think you're spiritual if you're up on the, up in the front.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:08.560]   Um, so I joined praise band, um, to do that to like, but then, you know, kind of recognized,
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.600]   uh, it was, my experience was pretty shallow.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:19.040]   Um, and I remember thinking as I graduated from high school, headed to college, um,
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.760]   if my church experience in college is the same as this, I don't know if I want to stick around.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:33.600]   Um, and then I came across our church because, um, one of my high school friends, um,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.280]   is Annie Song, we went to the same high school, same peer class, same graduating class.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.560]   Her older brother, Jim, uh, who's in our DMV church now.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.960]   He, um, he was a senior, uh, my freshman year.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.480]   And, um, so I had met him a few times, um, just various like stuff.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.600]   And then, um, and then when it came time for Cal day,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.080]   which is the kind of like the orient, not orientation.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.360]   It's like, it's like the day that the school tries to get you to come to their school
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.240]   after they've accepted you.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.760]   So UC Berkeley came up.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.160]   I stayed with Jim, um, and I had a blast that weekend.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.960]   I stayed over at Dana house, which is our bros ministry house.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.320]   Um, uh, that was the year that we, um, our church started impact.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.000]   So the very first impact spring fest, um, which was kind of like a, a week long,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.040]   um, like enrichment for, um, yeah, inner city, Oakland kids.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.440]   Um, and so they were up every night, just like prepping for it.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.560]   And I got to see that.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.160]   And then they hosted me and I just, I mean, I'm a high school senior, you know,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.120]   I've never been hosted in this way.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.600]   And I, I just had such a blast.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.600]   I remember having really fond memories and, and then they're Christian, you know,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.760]   so kind of like brought that back.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.400]   And then when it was time, uh, to come to college, I realized that, well, I had a really
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.040]   bad case of senioritis my senior year of high school.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.480]   And so, um, I received housing, but I forgot to pay the deposit.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.840]   And so I lost housing and I didn't know anything about like, oh, you can rent an
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.120]   apartment or anything like that.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.280]   And so then in desperation, I called Jim and he's the only person I knew.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.760]   And I said, Hey, uh, do you know anyone who can like, I can crash with for, you know,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.040]   housing and dining said they can give me housing in about a month after school starts.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.160]   So I said, I just need a month.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.880]   And then, so then he deliberated with his roommates.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.920]   It was going to be a senior year.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.800]   They wanted to use their place for ministry and all this kind of stuff.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.480]   And then they decided to take me in.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.120]   So, um, so I slept not in their closet, but in front of their closet.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.040]   I set up my bed, like, so then in order for them to get their clothes, they have to reach over
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.400]   my, my, you know, sleeping body, you know, kind of thing.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.040]   So it was a huge inconvenience for them.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.040]   I don't think I fully appreciated it at that time, but I'm so thankful.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.480]   And then all of them, they go to our church and Sunday morning is hard to wake up, you know,
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.080]   and, um, they have a car and they're driving to church.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.600]   And so I catch a ride.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.960]   And I mean, I church hopped for like all of one week after that.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.240]   I'm like, I like these guys.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.600]   But I also felt like, um, well, two things, um, the church that I was attending back at home,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.880]   they heard that I had checked out our church and actually the, one of the older guys took me
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.640]   aside and he said, Hey, um, I'm not sure about that church.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.440]   They're really different.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.200]   I said, Oh, how are they different?
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.080]   He goes, um, I think they're really conservative was what he said.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.400]   Okay.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.240]   And he kind of with, you know, essentially kind of said, you know, they're very different from us.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.360]   So I don't think you're going to like them.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.400]   And in my head, I was like, okay, okay.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.360]   But then in my head, I was like, maybe I'm going to check this out.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.720]   Because I really didn't like the church.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.000]   So I was like, if it's different from this, man, I might actually like it.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.720]   Give me a shot.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.440]   So yeah, so that was kind of, and, um, yeah, so then I, I stuck.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.120]   And then I started calling our church home, um, freshman year, first semester.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.600]   Okay.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.320]   So after Thanksgiving break, I was like, mom, I'm going home.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   And she was not happy.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.920]   Well, that's surprising.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.280]   Because I heard that one of your very first experiences at our church was somewhat traumatic.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.360]   What?
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.440]   And of certain sports outing.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.520]   So I get asked about this question, the story a lot.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.480]   Maybe this is an opportunity to set the record straight.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.160]   Because when I heard it for the first time, you like fell and you dislocated both your shoulders.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.280]   But that's not true.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.080]   That's actually not true, but it's not that far from true.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.280]   It's only half true.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.400]   So it was the, um, so I'm living with these guys.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.720]   It's the first week of school and our church, you know, our group is having like all sorts of
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.440]   welcome activities.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.720]   And one of them was a sports night.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:51.120]   And, um, somebody had, uh, uh, left, um, a pair of basketball shorts on my bed.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.080]   And I never had owned, I don't play sports.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.320]   I was never like that growing up.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.800]   So, um, I was like so excited.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.280]   Like, wow.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.240]   I have a pair of basketball.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.000]   I just took it for myself.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.680]   Finders keepers.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.960]   So later guys are worth my shorts.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.040]   But then, um, the problem was it was like an X large or a double X large.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.600]   I forget.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.720]   And it didn't have a drawstring.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.200]   Oh.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.880]   So it was fine when I'm walking around at home, it's pajamas or whatever.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.560]   But then I decided sports night.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.600]   I get to wear my new, kind of new shorts.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.800]   Go.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.760]   And, um, the, the game was capture the flag.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.480]   And you actually wear flag football flags.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.800]   Oh, that's great.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.840]   Freshman versus seniors.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.240]   And, um, we know where this is going.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.880]   So, um, so yeah, I'm not very athletic.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:41.200]   And yet, um, I got it in my head that if I run really fast, maybe I can get to that safe zone where the flags are.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.800]   And as I'm running, um, I start and then full speed, top speed, like, two miles an hour.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.880]   He was a math lead, not a math lead.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.760]   Were you a math major?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.280]   No, I wasn't.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.360]   But it was like middle school math competition.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.200]   Anyway, yeah, so I'm running.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.680]   And then some, uh, senior sister, and I remember it was a girl.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.440]   And I don't know who it was, though, thankfully.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.880]   Okay, yeah, probably Ellen.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   I don't think so, but I have my, yeah, anyway.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.520]   Uh, comes and, you know, pulls my flag.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.040]   And that's normal.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.360]   Except my shorts are underneath that flag.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.960]   And she pulled the shorts, too.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.360]   Oh!
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.320]   And the shorts go all the way down to my ankles.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.920]   And...
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.040]   Oh, she must have been mortified.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.000]   Hopefully she, oh.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.040]   I don't know if she noticed.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.560]   Oh, she didn't notice?
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.840]   I may, I don't know, but...
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.200]   Caught up in the moment.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.840]   But then I am going as fast as my little body can go, right?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.040]   So all that momentum, shorts at your ankles.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.680]   And then I fall over, face down on the, on the, on the turf field.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.280]   And I had this problem where I would dislocate my shoulders, starting from middle school.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.120]   Too much math.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.600]   And so, um, so then when I landed, I landed on one of my shoulders and one of my shoulders popped out.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.320]   Oh!
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:59.040]   So then I'm, so, so then at this point, people usually ask me, "Hey, how come you didn't just
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.200]   pull your shorts up with your other hand?"
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.320]   And I said, "Have you ever dislocated your shoulder?"
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.960]   So I'm holding my shoulder, um, face down, thankfully, but my shorts are at my ankles.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.160]   And then I had a, um, a guy who was kind of like, um, like an older guy who was kind of reaching out to me.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.040]   Is this massively built football player kind of, kind of guy.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.600]   And, um, he saw it from, I guess, wherever he was, sidelines or something.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.480]   And then he ran.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.120]   And he, very, I, I imagine.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.760]   I had to save you.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.800]   I was face down, so I don't actually see it, but I can also see it as like a, as it was a movie.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.720]   And he's running, and he's running parallel to my, my prone body.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.320]   And he grabs my shorts in, in one swift motion.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.040]   And he grabs it and pulls it up.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.160]   But the man's really strong.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:52.320]   And he actually lifts me off the ground by my shorts.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.960]   And so, oh my gosh, I never heard that part of this.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.520]   Oh man.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.960]   I, I didn't know what a wedgie was.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.800]   But now you do.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.440]   Now you do.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.080]   And so then, um.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.520]   It was a baptism by fire.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:03.840]   Is this Charlie?
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.360]   No, no, it's Henry.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.440]   And, oh my god, oh yeah.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.280]   Yeah, and then, and then he proceeded to declare in a loud voice.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.840]   He gathered a group of guys around to say, there is, there is nothing to see here.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.360]   Which made everybody who, who didn't notice anything, suddenly trying to look.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.800]   Anyway, um.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.600]   I was not there.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.080]   Yeah, okay.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.880]   Yeah, thankfully.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.000]   Which is why this has happened.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.680]   I think if I were there, I would've been like, oh my gosh.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.320]   Wow.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:32.960]   It's providence.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.280]   I think that ranks top five most traumatic freshman experience.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.240]   I didn't realize that was your freshman year.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:38.960]   Not even at our church.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.680]   Just freshman year.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.400]   That was freshman year.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.760]   Freshman year, like during welcome week.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:41.920]   First week.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.960]   During welcome week, yeah.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.520]   Wow.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.000]   Wow.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.720]   That's traumatic.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.520]   But you're here.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.320]   I'm still here.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:46.960]   You're here.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.000]   27 years later, just telling the story.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.600]   That is an awesome story.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.400]   Yeah, so let that set the record straight.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.280]   Wow.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.320]   That clarifies a lot of things.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.440]   That was worse than that.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.040]   Does that also explain a lot of things?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.880]   Yeah, actually.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   But we're talking about becoming Christian and why you stay in our church and everything.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:05.920]   Okay.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.640]   We can do that really quick.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.320]   We spent a lot of time.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.520]   Anyway, so you know how they say like if you're really well-churched, sometimes you have to be
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.280]   unsaved in order to become saved?
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.160]   So that was me.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.240]   I thought I knew so much.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.920]   But the whole aspect of sin, my personal sinfulness was kind of just a theoretical thing.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:32.800]   Until freshman year, winter retreat, the pastor preached on Luke 15.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.240]   And I was like, oh, I'm not the younger son.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.360]   I'm not rebellious like that.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.600]   But man, when he started preaching on the older son, that really hit me.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.640]   Because all my life, I had been in the father's house.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.760]   But there were so many ways in which I did not understand the father's heart.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.840]   And so I didn't understand the father's heart for me.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.720]   I didn't understand the father's heart for his lost children.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:01.360]   And I didn't understand that the father wanted a relationship with me.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.200]   And so all of that, and that was my rebellion.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   You know, there externally, but internally, like far, far away.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.480]   And so that really broke me.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.560]   That's when I made a clear salvation decision.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   That's when I said, oh, now I get it.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.480]   Now I understand why Jesus needs to be my savior.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   After that, it was kind of a struggle for lordship though.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.960]   Because some of those truths that I believed and I carried growing up was so deep in me.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.680]   And just the personal lack of reflection and personal lack of depth.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.400]   Like that, that was, that was a challenge to really kind of continue to muck through.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:47.200]   And, you know, so that the rest of my college experience was really an exercise of trying to
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.240]   get deeper, you know, be a little bit less shallow,
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.960]   be more thoughtful, recognize my sinfulness a little bit more.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.560]   But yeah, that's kind of how that happened.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:03.520]   And really it was like the first year after college where I experienced, I think in some
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.960]   ways that first step of like genuine lordship.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.360]   And, you know, they say that after college is kind of when the rubber finally hits the road.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.480]   Yeah, you're like writing checks.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.920]   Yeah, yeah, you're writing checks and now you have to finally cash them.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.840]   And I realized, wow, I don't have much stored up in the bank.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.040]   And so I think that was an experience of really struggling with, okay, what do I really believe?
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.640]   And what does, what does that implication for my life?
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.520]   So I spent that year in Tashkent.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.360]   I initially went, I remember my first thought of why I wanted to go, I just wanted to get away.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.560]   I wanted to get away from all these people that I thought had all these expectations for me.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:52.080]   And I just wanted some space to like, just try to live my life for God and to really wrestle
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.960]   with God and some of these truths that I was kind of realizing about myself.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.400]   And I think that's essentially what happened because there was time and space to read,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.440]   to pray, to kind of struggle and wrestle. And I didn't have this, you know,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.040]   a lot of people that I was so like face saving in front of, not, they weren't there with me per se.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.080]   So I think that was a really, man, God really used that time to kind of show me.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.680]   And that's, I made a Lordship decision while I was, so it was kind of odd, like, here's a missionary.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.200]   Becoming a Christian. Yay. Finally.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.000]   Actually that, that year that he was gone, because I mean, I liked him,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.360]   but I don't think he knew that I liked you.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.960]   But during that time, it was first year after one year of college staff.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.840]   And then I was, um, just running on empty, like I was doing all the right things,
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:50.640]   but just feeling really hollow. And then that second year, um, I think was when I really was able to
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.120]   struggle with that and did a lot of reading and flexing and praying.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.520]   And, um, that, I think that's when I also made a, um, Lordship decision.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.880]   Yeah. So you're saying it helped that he was away or?
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.560]   That, that probably helped too.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.440]   That's part of the struggle.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.560]   Angst.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.120]   Just distraction and everything gone.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.480]   Um, yeah.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:18.000]   Well, that's interesting because you guys both had like, um, a moment, like in your college,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.120]   you know, I feel like there's always these windows of opportunity where people may have a new spiritual
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.400]   openness or a new spiritual understanding of who they are and before God.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.520]   And there's like a significant move that happens there, but then post-grad, like after you graduate,
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.400]   there's another moment, another window of opportunity there as well.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.880]   Well, that where there's like openness and kind of like a who am I and a re-examining of everything.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.520]   Right.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.600]   Which is a good segue into today's topic.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.080]   Perfect.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.320]   Acts 2 next, which is a new, kind of a new ministry for, that we started and something
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.120]   that the FitLit you guys have been trying to tackle.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.240]   So, um, because I think so far it's been sort of your college student and then your staff.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.640]   And I think what we're seeing is, okay, but those first three years, it is this very kind of
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:06.560]   tumultuous, tumultuous kind of interesting time or lots changing and you're trying to adapt
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.240]   to this new reality after you graduate and next is sort of a, in some ways like a response to that.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.680]   But maybe you guys could just explain what is Acts 2 next, um, and kind of what was the impetus,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.880]   at least in your understanding, because you guys have been doing a lot of stuff with Acts 2 next.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:27.440]   Yeah, I think, um, I think, okay, so what is Acts 2 next?
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:35.360]   Acts 2 next is, um, a ministry that tries to, um, that is reaching out to
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.680]   people from senior year of college through maybe the third year out of college.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:49.840]   Um, and that group of people, perhaps many of them did not go through four years of our college ministry,
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.720]   or some of them did, but they, you know, they're kind of in and out.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.960]   And for one, one reason or another, um, a year or two after graduation, they're not really quite
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.840]   ready to like join our staff team or they like us, but they're kind of distant, they're busy, you know,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.360]   whatever. Yeah. And so it's kind of a group of folks that we really want to, um, minister to
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.880]   and pour into and raise them up. Well, one, you know, share the gospel with and become Christian,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.080]   of course, but then if they are Christian, then we want to raise them up to see a particular picture
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:27.040]   of Christian life as their life as a minister. Um, and by doing that, we can, it's kind of like a
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.880]   slightly, I don't want to say it negatively, but I do, you know, a slower on ramp into our staff life.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.000]   Yeah. I don't think that's the same negative either. I think some people appreciate that
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.600]   because they're like, I'm not, it's almost, you know, I'm not ready for like zero to a hundred.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.440]   Yeah. But if I, you know, have a longer on ramp.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.720]   I want some time to like kind of get to know you guys and figure out this is what I want to do.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.960]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's also, I think what we've been seeing is, um,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.520]   some people just have more time after college.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.920]   Yeah. Just causes our, when we were in college, it was just like, like you never studied, you just,
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:02.320]   we were just like, you don't go to college and you're just like, woo, you know, but nowadays
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.000]   it's so competitive, people are like joining all kinds of clubs and stuff. It's a little bit different
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.240]   and it's like after college, that's kind of when people go, Oh, what was all that for?
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.800]   Yeah. I now have all this time. What am I doing with it? And so maybe for a lot of people,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.400]   those existential questions that they're asking that maybe some more people used to ask freshman year.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.920]   of college or sophomore year of college. Yeah. Or they're, they're not, their head's still down
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.120]   through all the way through college. They're not really asking those questions until maybe their
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.000]   first or second year out of college or maybe even at the tail end of senior year. Yeah. You know?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.080]   Yeah. And I feel like maybe in the past, the way we did ministry and stuff was sort of like,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.160]   okay, if you're not asking those right now, like you don't really fit in anywhere. And then if you're
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.480]   asking it later, you don't really fit anywhere either, you know? And so it's kind of too late. We don't have
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   like a way to like, yeah, you know, I mean, you minister to a lot of your, um, I remember you
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.800]   minister to a lot of your friends, your senior year, right? So it's kind of like that picture,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.520]   but that's kind of, I feel like that was rare at our church. Yeah. I mean, I do think sort of the
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.160]   prevailing wisdom, at least when we were undergrads is college is when you have time and it's when you
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.560]   should think about these things. Cause when you graduate, it's just too busy. And I mean, it is busy when
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.040]   you graduate, but I think college has just changed now. So now that calculus is kind of, it's shifted.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.000]   So now it's like, no, maybe when you graduate is the time, it's time. And then I mean, with the job
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.520]   market as it is, some people got some, um, long period before they even start work. So yeah.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:31.360]   Yeah. Another aspect is, um, like college, you kind of have community already there,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:38.720]   like dorm life or clubs. Um, and then, you know, like you're studying to get out, but then senior
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.000]   year you realize, oh my gosh, like I need to find a job. I like, I'm going to move out of this place.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.920]   Like, am I going to have friends? Like all my friends are going to other places for jobs,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:55.600]   like I'm moving by myself. So I think senior year after that kind of like, um, rat race grind is going
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.240]   to halt soon. Then they're asking all these questions. Yeah. And it's hard to make friends once you
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.760]   graduate. Oh yeah. It's not as easy as college for sure. Yeah. There's so much of the campus that
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.000]   just serves that up for you. Yeah. And so then they graduate and they feel bereft, you know,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.160]   they might have a great job in it, but they're in a new city and they don't have any family or friends
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:19.520]   there. And like coworkers are not the same kind of friends that like, you know, so, um, I think one,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.400]   one other thing is like in general, people are a lot less connected. Yeah. Right. And so the fastest
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.360]   growing household is household one. Yeah. So then they don't have anyone to like even ask a basic
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:36.080]   question. Like, like everything is, all of your answers come online from these like, you know,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:43.440]   faceless articles. And, um, and I think people are, are really hungry for connection during that period too.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.840]   Yeah. So actually next is sort of coming in and filling that need, I guess. That's a,
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.160]   that's definitely the felt need. Trying to figure out what shape this needs to be.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.760]   Yeah. To, to kind of meet that need. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, what, what have you guys been doing? Like,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.920]   what, what have you guys been engaging in trying to shape this new ministry or, or give shape to it? And
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   what are the things you guys, what are the things you guys have primarily been doing to do that?
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:16.880]   Yeah. So, um, everyone who is like trying to head up an acts to next group in our church across our
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.040]   network. Um, if you ask them and there's like 12 people, you'll get 12 different answers right now.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.640]   Everyone's just kind of feeling things out. All they know is this is kind of the age range and whatever,
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:36.880]   like, but for us, um, because, um, we're a lot more mobile this year. Um,
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.800]   so one of the things that we've been kind of doing is, uh, we've been hitting campuses. Um,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   so we've been going on various trips for one reason or another. Um, but, uh, yeah,
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:55.280]   so we call them ERTs evangelistic road trips. Um, we spent a good chunk of time in New York. Um,
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.800]   we went through a couple of campuses in the Midwest. Um, we went to Atlanta, um, about a month ago.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:07.760]   And, um, and then, uh, some of the, um, some of our folks went to, um, Southern California. So
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:16.080]   I think for us, one of the things that we're trying to tackle is, um, understand, uh, as a senior in
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.520]   college, like, what do you feel like you need as you project your future? Yeah. And, um, it's interesting
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.720]   because a lot of them are saying, you know, I think career, there's a lot of things out there.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.760]   No, there's no one to tell me how to do relationships. I don't know how to keep,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.920]   am I going to lose my friend? Like this whole question of friends, like, I think that's a big need,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:42.000]   but it's also kind of, you know, um, it, it's not something that, um, people are talking about a whole
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.560]   lot. Um, so I think that's, so we go out, we, we collect some data, we do surveys. Um, we try to make
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.360]   some good connections with people. Sometimes we will go to a campus and we'll just, um, have like Bible
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:00.160]   studies, like, uh, like a 50, Hey, you interested in a 15 minute Bible study. Um, and then we'll just
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.120]   kind of go through maybe like the rich full text and Luke or something like that. And just kind of peak,
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.960]   see where people's spiritual interest is, especially as like seniors in college. And then, um,
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:18.640]   and talk to a lot of people and as we do that, I think, um, the people with whom we've had really
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.760]   good connections on their campus, we can actually continue that conversation when we come back home.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.200]   And so whether it's like, uh, sometimes we'll invite them to our coaching session, uh, we'll invite
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.760]   them to a webinar about job search or something like that. Other times it's just straight up like,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.240]   Hey, um, you want to chat about that thing that you shared with me about when, when I was out there.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.960]   And then they'll set up like a 30 minute meeting. And some of those conversations have been kind of
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.640]   ongoing. Um, I think there's even like, um, kind of course, one-on-one Bible study evangelistic kind of,
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.480]   um, things that are starting up. So that's some of the things that we've seen.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.640]   So you've been more in like a, almost like a data gathering, surveying, and then like an online
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.360]   kind of that this is taking. Yeah. What, what are some things you've been learning through that? I mean,
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.840]   you've seen a variety of campuses different in each context, or is there like some, some similarities
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:14.240]   that are sort of popping up? Yeah, definitely. Um, there's a variety, uh, some of the campuses
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:20.720]   and these are generalities of course. And you know, you can, I don't know, I don't know that we are such a
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:28.320]   great data collection, you know, organization, but from our experiences, um, there are some campuses
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:35.280]   where we were overwhelmed by the number of people who are spiritually interested in the other places
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:43.360]   where people are just kind of more, you know, tepid. Um, and it's, it's interesting that, um, uh,
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.200]   you would feel that way. You would think that like people are all so different and they're all kind of
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.440]   evenly spread up, but it's, it's not, you know, and it's like a campus culture, like there's a campus
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:58.800]   culture, uh, openness or maybe hostility or like blase or whatever. So that's definitely true.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:05.200]   Yeah. I think, um, just talking to college students at campuses, these new campuses, like we meet
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:12.160]   Christians, um, plugged in, you know, they're being discipled, but, um, like one Christian after another,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:18.320]   we've, after we're having conversations, we're like, they just are hungry for just training or they have
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:24.080]   mentors, but then like just being able to articulate their faith or, um, being trained in apologetics,
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   like it's not something that they're regularly getting, like they might be reading the Bible, but
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:35.840]   in terms of, um, being able to persuade or being able to articulate and, um, explain Christianity or just
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.920]   these different questions, like that's a need that we saw or, um, yeah. So, or there's a campus that as
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.920]   we were doing the surveys, we see that many of them have never heard the gospel, you know? So, um, I think
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:53.680]   just going, having these times where we can, we're surveying and just having conversations and we're kind of
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   armed with just different questions that we might ask on a campus, um, it's, it's been very eye-opening,
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:08.320]   um, recently because we, we tried to, uh, we kind of distilled it down to three different areas or topics,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:16.160]   uh, for X2NEX, like career, um, and then adulting or adulthood, and then faith. So, um, on our website,
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:23.840]   we kind of categorized in that way. And on, for the web, we try to, on a regular basis, um, have something
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:33.120]   to, uh, uh, that caters to each of those, um, areas. Um, but I think for postgrads, many of them, like,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.640]   they might be graduating from grad school or they have a job, but, um, it seems like they just want an
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.800]   older, stable. A lot of them talk about just wanting somebody to talk to. Talk to, like, just a mental,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.040]   like, am I going in the right direction? Like, what, from your experience, like, how has it been? Or,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.120]   you know, like that kind of conversation. Whereas in, like, juniors and seniors that we're meeting on
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.880]   campus, like, who are going to graduate, like, they're kind of like, how do I write a resume? You
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.200]   know? It's like that, those kind of needs. Yeah. Um, that's interesting. So those three topics,
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:11.920]   I think, um, in terms of, like, drawing somebody in with one of those topics, I actually think that
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:19.680]   from what we've seen, um, like, we, we put on these webinars, um, online and, um, the career type of
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:25.040]   webinars, even though they said, oh, we're good on career. We really want adulthood or those kinds of
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.720]   topics. People don't sign up for those. People sign up for the career ones. So I think that's just an
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.440]   easier step in lower barrier. Yeah. And then I think the adulthood, they want to, they want to
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   talk to someone who they can kind of trust. Yeah. So it's kind of hard to come in cold to something
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.520]   like that. And then faith for sure. Right. Someone that you've had a really good conversation with.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:51.120]   So I think that's kind of the progression that we're kind of starting to feel. Um, but, uh,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:56.480]   even a totally cold contact, let's say they received a survey for 30 seconds and then they got a candy
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:03.440]   bar out of it or something and we never see them again. But one of the things is if somehow we can
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.800]   get them into some kind of a coaching conversation, um, those conversations tend to be very personal,
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.200]   you know, and, and they reveal a lot about themselves and you reveal, and then there's a connection there.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:19.600]   And, um, I think people, because people are so hungry for connection, I think, um, if that can happen,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:26.000]   then, um, then you can really start to build that relationship. It's, it's not so hard. It's that initial
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   first step. That's interesting. Yeah. So it seems like it calls for something like kind of hybrid
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.480]   where like the lower barrier entry, maybe just clear add value. It's just like a clear thing,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.720]   but then what people really are gunning for is they want to talk to someone face to face,
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:44.480]   slightly older, get some, I think in that interpersonal, just want to be heard, like someone to hear them out,
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.280]   you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The challenge is figuring out how do you get there, I guess. Yeah. Yes.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.520]   And then kind of also like what kind of minister do you need to be to, to be able to engage in this industry is
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:02.720]   like patient, you know, a lot of wisdom, you know, um, good listener, probably helps if you're a little
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.320]   older, like not just, you know, one or two years out of college. Yeah. Yeah. And not like maybe so hungry
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.280]   for them to like join something, but to just really, or for them to even like you. Yeah. You just want to
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:19.680]   bless them. Yeah. I think people can, can tell if you don't hear that or not. Any thoughts on how,
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.800]   I mean, this is very new. Um, but as you, as we see kind of envision it going forward, any thoughts on
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.520]   how it affects sort of the way we think about college ministry and like, I don't know. I mean,
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.200]   chances are you guys will be back in college ministry at some point. Um, any thoughts on like,
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.800]   okay, given that we have this next group, it makes me think about college ministry differently in some way.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:47.760]   I think it could be, um, like if I were a college staff, college minister, I think it can be alleviating
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:58.320]   in some ways. Um, because I mean, it's always true that you feel nervous. You feel nervous about
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.040]   the people that you're trying to raise up. You're reaching out to them. You're pouring into them and
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:09.120]   you're, you want to bless them, but at the same time, you really hope that they'll catch the vision.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.640]   They'll join us, you know, all this, all this kind of stuff, this kind of high bar stuff. And, um,
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.600]   I remember feeling that way when I was doing college ministry, like feeling like nervous, man,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.040]   I don't know if these people are going to become those kinds of people. And then you feel down on
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.880]   yourself or you feel insecure and all these kinds of, I think a lot of that could be alleviated.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:36.240]   If you know that let's give them more time, like, because like by the time like second semester junior
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.440]   year rolls around, you're like, oh shoot, you know, where is this person? And like, but, um, you know,
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:47.840]   you have more time. Um, even like with our networks of spread apart now, um, even if they don't stay
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:53.440]   here in my city, but they go somewhere else, then I think we'll have a chance to like continue to
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.280]   minister to them even after college at a pace that they are okay with, you know? And I think that's kind
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:05.040]   of like, I think that would be the, the relieving thing, um, for let's say a college minister.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:11.200]   It would require a lot more like trust and surrender kind of like what we did earlier,
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.240]   you know, and, and prayer. I think God's actually still working.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.680]   Yeah. I think something that I learned, um, cause I felt that when I was in college ministry,
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:25.200]   but then when I was doing youth ministry, like once they graduated, graduate high school,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.920]   like who knows where they're going to go. But it was very clear to me as a youth minister that
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.840]   during their years in high school, like I want to share the gospel with them, love on them. Um,
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:41.440]   hopefully they'll become a Christian. Um, but even if they don't become a Christian in high school, like
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.160]   positive experience of Christianity, you know, and of Christians and, um, and then hopefully in college
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:54.480]   they'll, you know, seek God and become a Christian, but ultimately it's about like saving souls. And so
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:02.400]   I feel like with Acts 2 next and kind of like a slower on-ramp, like as a college minister, I don't have to
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:08.080]   have that kind of pressure, like, you know, like they need to make it become a Christian and just be
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.400]   disciple and stay at our church, like kind of thing. But, um, the goal is okay. Yeah. I just want to
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:20.640]   pray for them and share the gospel with them. And, um, that's, hopefully they'll become a Christian,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:27.280]   but it's, it doesn't have to happen in those four years, you know, that little window. Um, and so I'm
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:33.040]   going to do my best as a college minister to, you know, share the gospel with them and answer their
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.840]   questions and get them there. But yeah, I think that it's alleviating that kind of pressure.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   Yeah. Yeah. So just, I mean, what I'm hearing is like maybe that timetable has shifted,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.320]   it's delayed a little bit now and that's okay, you know, or elongated, elongated. Yeah. And like,
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:54.080]   instead of like really just trying to focus on this person and, and, and create a lot of pressure
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.000]   or situation around that, I can actually step back in the space and I can meet other people. I can,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.240]   I can widen the group of people that I'm concerned with and I'm keeping up to date with. And then I think
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.880]   one thing that's kind of interesting is that, um, like we can do that. Like we don't like,
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.720]   there might be other ministries where like it, you have to make use of those four years, you know,
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:16.000]   because like you're, you're student driven or whatever, or, you know, like you have to produce
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   a certain amount of like collegiate staff at the end of it, you know, before they graduate,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.400]   you know, you have to get them. But for us, it's like, well, we're network and we're not going anywhere.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.640]   And you know, we, we have plenty of working people and we're, we're also doing ministry. And so,
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:34.720]   um, we, we actually might be, we have a unique, maybe a approach to this that, um, some other
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:40.160]   collegiate ministries don't. And, um, I think all that, I think the, you know, the thing that's really
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:46.160]   hopeful for this ministry and maybe we're not there yet because we're only six months in, but is to
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:53.120]   have a place for say a new grad or two years out to be able to minister to their coworker.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:58.000]   And I mean, that's always been the case, but they came in and then bring them in to,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.840]   because into our community and to our church and even start to see them grow and we can challenge
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:10.240]   them to serve, give them service opportunities. And through that, I think, um, that was kind of lacking,
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:16.080]   you know, that avenue in to our church once you graduate, once you graduated was kind of lacking.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.840]   So I think that's, that's exciting because where we are, there's a ton of people that are
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.800]   coming in to our areas. You know, they might've graduated from some place that we're not,
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.440]   but then they end up in one of our cities. Oh man, we should do a podcast with those people
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.320]   and just ask them their experiences. Yeah. That's pretty exciting.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.720]   Yeah. Yeah. So it's different for our church. It's new. We're in like a pioneering phase where
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   you have 12 different groups are doing 12 different things, very natural for a pioneering phase,
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.800]   but, uh, but I'm very hopeful that this will turn into something. And so, um, I think everyone's
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.520]   excited to hear whether or not you're doing an x2nex at your local ministry or not. I think we're all
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.880]   very excited for, for this. Yeah. So thank you guys so much. Yeah. Thanks for having us. Thank you.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.680]   And, uh, like, subscribe, tune in to future episodes, but thank you guys for being on this podcast.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.340]   Thank you.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:02.840]   We'll see you next time.
