[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.280]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.740]   My guest today is Dr. David Buss.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.800]   Dr. Buss is a professor of psychology
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.760]   at the University of Texas, Austin,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.080]   and he is one of the founding members and luminaries
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.800]   in the field of evolutionary psychology.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.160]   Dr. Buss's laboratory is responsible
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.400]   for understanding the strategies that humans use
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.480]   to select mates in the short and long term.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.520]   And he is an expert in sex differences in mating strategy.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.600]   His laboratory has explored, for instance,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.780]   why women cheat on their spouses or their long-term partners
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.360]   as well as why men tend to cheat on their spouses
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.160]   and long-term partners.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.720]   He's also explored a number of things related
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   to the courtship dance that we call dating
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260]   and securing a mate,
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.600]   including the use of deception related
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.080]   to proclamations of love or promises of finances
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.360]   or sexual activity.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.720]   Dr. Buss's laboratory has also evaluated
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.560]   how status is assessed,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.540]   meaning how we evaluate our own worth
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.480]   and our potential as a mate,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.800]   and who is, let's just say, within range
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.000]   of a potential mate, both in the short and long term.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880]   For instance, today we talk about
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.840]   how people don't just make direct assessments
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840]   of their own and other people's value
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.980]   as a potential mate,
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.260]   but also using the assessments of others
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260]   to indirectly determine whether or not
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.180]   they stand a chance or not in securing somebody
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.160]   as a short or long-term mate.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.520]   His laboratory has also focused on some of the complicated
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.000]   and varied emotions related to mating love
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.540]   in relationships such as lust and jealousy.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.680]   And he's extensively explored something
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.480]   called mate poaching or the various strategies
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.180]   that men and women use to make sure
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.900]   that the person that they want to be with
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.800]   or the person they are with is not with anyone else
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.540]   or seeking anyone else,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.360]   and indeed that other people don't seek their mate.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.140]   Dr. Buss's work also relates to how biological influences,
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.420]   such as ovulation or time within the menstrual cycle,
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.940]   influences mate selection or tendency to have sex or not
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.700]   with a potential short or long-term mate.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.660]   And more recent work from Dr. Buss's laboratory
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.180]   focuses on the darker aspects of mating
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.620]   and sexual behavior in humans,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.460]   including stalking and sexual violence.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.060]   Today, we discuss all those topics.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.340]   We also discuss some of the strategies that humans can use
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.860]   to make healthy mate selection choices
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.540]   and for those that are already in committed relationships
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.180]   to ensure healthy progression
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.900]   of those committed relationships.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.460]   In addition to publishing dozens
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.780]   of landmark scientific studies,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.760]   Dr. Buss has authored many important books.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.380]   A few of those include "The Evolution of Desire"
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500]   and "Why Women Have Sex."
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.520]   And his most recent book is the one that I'm reading now,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.260]   which is called "When Men Behave Badly,
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.100]   The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.580]   Harassment, and Assault."
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.940]   And it's an absolutely fascinating read.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.060]   It has endorsements from Dr. Robert Sapolsky,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.980]   professor at Stanford,
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.520]   who's been on this podcast as a guest before,
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.740]   as well as Steven Pinker and Jonathan Haidt,
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.220]   who wrote "The Coddling of the American Mind."
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.380]   It's a really important book, I believe,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.820]   and one that doesn't just get into the darker aspects
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.840]   of human mating behavior and violence,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.800]   but also strategies that people can take
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.680]   to ensure healthy mating behavior and relationships.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.660]   There's so much rumor, speculation,
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.180]   and outright fabrication of ideas
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.640]   about why humans select particular mates
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.240]   in the short and long term,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.820]   what men and women do differently, and so on.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.500]   What I love about Dr. Buss's work
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.380]   is that it's grounded in laboratory studies
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.680]   that are highly quantitative using rigorous statistics.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.220]   And so throughout today's discussion,
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.220]   you'll notice that I'm wrapped with attention,
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.420]   trying to extract as much information as I can
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.260]   from Dr. Buss about the real science
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.060]   of human mate selection and mating strategy.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.680]   I'm certain that everyone will take away
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.200]   extremely valuable knowledge
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.020]   that they can use in existing or future relationships
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.260]   from this discussion with Dr. Buss.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.060]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.100]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.240]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.320]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.700]   to the general public.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.740]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.440]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.260]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.300]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.740]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.980]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.620]   and I can tell you that the cells and connections
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.060]   of our brain and visual system
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.280]   have to contend with an enormous number of challenges
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.600]   in order to see clearly.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.940]   For instance, when you go from a brightly lit environment
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.460]   to a dimmer environment or into a shadow,
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.460]   your visual system has to adjust.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.940]   The problem with a lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses out there
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.960]   is that they don't work well with those adjustments.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.900]   Roca has overcome those challenges,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.660]   and as a consequence, no matter what environment you're in,
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.540]   you see with crystal clarity.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.900]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are also terrific
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.500]   because they are extremely lightweight,
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.540]   so you don't even notice that they're on your face.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.520]   And they can be worn when working or for school
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.800]   or just walking about, but also when running or cycling.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.620]   And indeed, if you get sweaty,
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.220]   they won't slip off your face.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.520]   That's a terrific feature,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.460]   but they can be worn to do anything.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.720]   I wear readers at night and sometimes when I drive at night.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.420]   And a wonderful thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.900]   is that unlike a lot of other performance glasses out there
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.820]   that make people look like cyborgs
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.380]   or make it look like you're definitely off to exercise,
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.020]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.180]   have a range of terrific aesthetics
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.440]   that you could wear anywhere.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.060]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,

[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.980]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.980]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.620]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.260]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.440]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.100]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.100]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.140]   that strongly impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.880]   can only be assessed from a quality blood test.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.620]   And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.220]   you can get additional information about how your body
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.940]   and your nervous system work, your immune system,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.860]   in ways that can inform better health choices.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.000]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.660]   is that you don't get any information
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.700]   about what to do with the data that you get.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.320]   Inside Tracker solves that problem.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.420]   They have a very easy to use dashboard,
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.340]   so when you get your numbers back,
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.560]   it can direct you towards specific nutrition,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.820]   supplementation, or lifestyle changes that you can make
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.660]   in order to bring the numbers for a given hormones,
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.480]   metabolic factors, immune factors into the range
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.780]   that's ideal for you.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.600]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.220]   go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.080]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.020]   that's supported by 25 peer-reviewed published studies
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.600]   and benefits from over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.860]   There is now a plethora of scientific data
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.120]   pointing to the fact that a regular meditation practice
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.740]   is immensely beneficial for reducing anxiety,
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.200]   improving sleep, improving focus,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.480]   many, many other aspects of mental and physical health.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.260]   The challenge many people have, however,
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.620]   is maintaining a regular meditation practice,
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.640]   and indeed, I am one of those people.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.520]   I've been meditating on and off for about 30 years,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   and I confess a lot of times it's more off than on
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.260]   until a few years ago when I started using the Headspace app
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.760]   and then I found it very easy,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.000]   and I continue to find it easy
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.200]   to maintain a daily meditation practice,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.480]   and that's because Headspace
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.600]   has many meditations to select from.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.380]   So even if I only have five minutes or 15 minutes,
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.620]   I'm able to do a meditation,
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.200]   I really enjoy those meditations,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.840]   and I always see the benefits of those meditations.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.680]   In fact, if I just miss a couple of days,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.860]   I start to notice that I'm not doing as well
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.320]   as when I'm meditating regularly.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.840]   The Headspace app makes it exceedingly easy
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.400]   to meditate regularly.

[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.920]   And now my conversation with Dr. David Buss.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.880]   Well, David, delighted to be here.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.220]   I've followed your work for a number of years,
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.280]   and I'm excited to ask you a number of questions
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.560]   about these super interesting topics
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.520]   about how people select mates,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   how they lie, cheat, but also behave well
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.320]   in this dance that we call mate choice.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.160]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.840]   Fortunately, there are well-behaving humans in the mix here.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.680]   - Good to know.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.460]   Just to start off,
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.480]   perhaps you could just orient us a little bit
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.080]   about mate choice.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.500]   You know, some of the primary criteria
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.400]   that studies show men and women use
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.120]   in order to select mates,
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.200]   both, shall we call them transient mates,
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.260]   as well as lifetime mates.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.960]   - Right, well, that's a critical distinction
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.680]   because what people look for
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.980]   in a long-term committed mateship,
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.200]   like a marriage partner or a long-term romantic relationship
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.360]   is different from what people look for
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.520]   in a hookup or casual sex or one-night stand
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.940]   or even a brief affair.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.300]   So that's actually critical.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.900]   I wonder if we could maybe just back up a second
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.100]   and just talk a little bit about the theoretical framework
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.060]   for understanding mate choice.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.820]   So it basically stems from Darwin's theory
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.480]   of sexual selection.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.540]   And most people, when they think about evolution,
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.380]   they think about cliches like survival of the fittest
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.160]   or nature, red in tooth and claw.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.100]   And Darwin noticed that there were phenomena
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.420]   that couldn't be explained
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.980]   by this so-called survival selection,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.900]   things like the brilliant plumage of peacocks,
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.480]   sex differences, like stags, for example,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.260]   have these massive antlers
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260]   and the females of the species do not.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.100]   And so he came up with the theory of sexual selection,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.820]   which deals not with the evolution of characteristics
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.940]   due to their survival advantage,
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.380]   but rather due to their mating advantage.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.320]   And he identified two causal processes
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.940]   by which mating advantage could occur.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.900]   One is intrasexual competition
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.300]   with the stereotyping two stags locking horns in combat
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.460]   with the victor gaining sexual access
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.100]   to the female loser ambling off with a broken antler
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.180]   and dejected and low self-esteem
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.060]   and needing psychotherapy perhaps
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.760]   or mate value improvement therapy.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.660]   And the logic was whatever qualities led to success
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.100]   in these same-sex battles,
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.820]   those qualities get passed on in greater numbers.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.900]   And so you see evolution, which has changed over time
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.980]   and increase in frequency of the characteristics
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.940]   associated with winning these,
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.420]   what Darwin called contest competition.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.980]   And we know that the logic of that is more general now
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.540]   and involves things like in our species competing
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.260]   for position and status hierarchies.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.420]   So anyway, so intrasexual competition is one,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.960]   but the second most relevant to your question
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.980]   about mate choice is preferential mate choice.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.400]   That was the second causal pathway.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.180]   And the logic there is that if members of one sex
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.120]   agree with one another, if there's some consensus
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.440]   about the qualities that are desired,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.060]   then those of the opposite sex
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.840]   who possess the desired qualities
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.020]   or embody those desired qualities,
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.780]   they have a mating advantage.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.340]   They get chosen, they get preferred,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.340]   those lacking desired qualities get banished, shunned,
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.420]   ignored, or in the modern environment become incels.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.240]   And so the logic there is very simple,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.940]   but also very powerful.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.940]   And that is that whatever qualities are desired,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.100]   consensually desired,
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.220]   if there's some heritable basis to those,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.260]   then those increase in frequency over time.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.780]   And so, and in the human case,
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.500]   these two causal processes of sexual selection
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.840]   are related to each other in that the preferences of,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.660]   the mate preferences of one sex
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.160]   basically set the ground rules for competition
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.280]   in the opposite sex.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.860]   So if, for example, hypothetically,
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.500]   women preferred to mate with men
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.160]   who were able and willing to devote resources to them,
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.120]   then that would create competition among men
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.460]   to claw their way and beat out other men
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.040]   in resource acquisition and then displaying
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.180]   that their willingness to commit that to a particular woman.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.340]   And same with women though.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.740]   And this is one of the interesting things about humans
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.140]   is that we have mutual mate choice,
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.260]   which is not true in all species.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.540]   So, and that is that it's not just a matter of,
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.680]   you know, you selecting someone to be your mate,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.920]   they have to reciprocally select you.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.600]   And so with mutual mate choice,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.220]   we have both preferences,
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.020]   mate preferences that women have
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.160]   and mate preferences that men have,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.020]   and consequently competition among men
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.620]   for access to the most desirable women
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.140]   and competition among women
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.820]   for access to the most desirable men.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.380]   So that's sort of a little bit of theoretical backdrop.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.440]   So you asked, well, what are the qualities
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.300]   that men and women desire?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   And maybe we'll start with long-term mating
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.140]   and then shift to short-term mating.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.260]   And long-term mating is interesting in and of itself
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.240]   in that it's very rare in the mammalian world.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.400]   So there are more than 5,000 species of primates
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.620]   of which, I'm sorry, more than 5,000 species of mammals
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.980]   of which we are one.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.180]   But the percentage of mammals
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.100]   that have anything resembling
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.660]   like a pair-bonded long-term mating strategy,
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.600]   it's about three to 5%.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.580]   It's extremely rare.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.060]   And even our closest primate relatives, the chimpanzees,
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.460]   they don't have a long-term mating strategy.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.260]   They don't have anything resembling pair-bonded mating.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.000]   In the chimps, the females come into estrus.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.940]   Almost all the sexual activity occurs
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.820]   during the estrus phase.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.380]   After that, males and females basically ignore each other
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.680]   for the most part, with some exceptions.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.400]   But with humans, you have the evolution
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.360]   of long-term pair-bonding, attachment,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.860]   heavy male investment in offspring,
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.520]   relatively concealed ovulation.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.900]   And so these are kind of unique aspects
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.880]   of the human mating system.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.060]   So to get to your question,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.300]   so well, what are the qualities?
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.520]   So the best, the most large-scale study
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.500]   that's been done on this is a study that I did a while back
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   of 37 different cultures.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.920]   And it's now been replicated by other researchers.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.780]   But basically what we found is three clusters of things.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.100]   We found qualities that both men and women wanted
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.900]   in a long-term mate.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.460]   We found some qualities that were sex-differentiated,
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.540]   where women preferred them more than men
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.500]   or men preferred them more than women.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.380]   And then we found some attributes
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.260]   that were highly variable across cultures
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.340]   in whether people found these as desirable
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.020]   or indispensable or irrelevant in a mate.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.060]   And so I could give examples of each of these, if that.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.300]   - Yeah, that would be great.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.100]   I'd love to know what some of the common themes were
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.660]   across these cultures in terms of what's being,
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.980]   made and sexually selected for.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.720]   - Yeah, so some of the things that were,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.700]   so if you talk about universal desire,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.580]   so things that men and women share,
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.740]   there are things like intelligence, kindness,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.420]   mutual attraction and love,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.140]   which is really kind of heartwarming
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.620]   'cause some people think that love
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.340]   is a recent Western invention by some European poets,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.580]   but it turns out it's not true.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.460]   You go to the klungsan in Botswana
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.420]   and they describe pretty much the same experience
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.180]   as a falling in love as we do,
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.180]   and even describe the distinction
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.740]   between this kind of infatuation stage of love
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.420]   and the attachment phase where you can't maintain
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.340]   this frenzy of infatuation and obsession for very long,
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.500]   six weeks, maybe six months at most.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.140]   Otherwise you can get nothing else done in your life.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.560]   - Yeah, those are those dopamine circuits
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.340]   firing at high frequency.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.340]   - Yeah, so mutual attraction, love,
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:04.660]   good health, dependability, emotional stability,
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.680]   although there's a bit of a sex difference there
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.900]   with women preferring it a bit more than men.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.260]   And so basically, and these may seem obvious,
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.260]   so no one wants a stupid, mean, ugly, disease-ridden mate.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:24.060]   And so perhaps obvious, but no one knew this
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.660]   in advance of the 37 culture study.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.500]   So these were some universal preferences.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.620]   So you go to the Zulu tribe in South Africa
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:37.620]   or Rio de Janeiro in Brazil or Portugal or Oslo
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.100]   or anywhere in the world, and these are qualities
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.420]   that people universally desire in long-term mates.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.360]   Sex differences.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.540]   So sex differences basically fell into two clusters.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.540]   So women more than men prioritized good earning capacity,
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:06.540]   slightly older age, and the qualities associated
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.320]   with resource acquisition.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.860]   So these are things like a man's social status.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.020]   Does he have a drive?
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.380]   Is he ambitious?
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.260]   Does he have a good long-term resource trajectory
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.780]   is one way that I like to phrase it,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.460]   because women often, they don't look at necessarily
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.760]   the resources that a guy possesses at this moment,
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.460]   but what is his trajectory?
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.300]   And so-
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.300]   - Just sorry to interrupt, but may I ask,
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.100]   is there anything known about the commonalities
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.620]   of how that is assessed?
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.060]   Is it, you know, he's rolling out of bed early
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.060]   and running eight miles, he's showing proficiency in school,
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.560]   he handles himself well socially at parties,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.580]   isn't drinking too much, but knows when, you know,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.060]   I mean, obviously they're integrating multiple cues.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.860]   The brain is a complex place, but is there any information
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.940]   about what those variables are across cultures?
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.580]   - Yeah, well, I think that there's been less attention
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.980]   to that, so that's a great question.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.780]   One of the things that we do know across cultures
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.020]   is that women attend to the attention structure.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.140]   So the attention structure is a key determinant of status.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.680]   So there's people who are high in status
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.820]   are those to whom the most people pay the most attention.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.420]   - Ah, so the attention of others to them,
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.840]   not how well a given potential mate can focus
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.260]   and pay attention necessarily.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260]   - Yes, yeah, exactly.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.880]   But women, look, I mean, you know,
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.140]   is the guy, even in the modern environment,
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.340]   is the guy spending eight hours a day playing video games,
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.040]   eating Cheetos and drinking beer,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.200]   or is he devoting effort to his professional development?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.300]   So hard work, ambition, does he have clear goals,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.040]   or is he in an existential crisis,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.300]   not knowing what he's gonna do with his life?
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.460]   So those are some of the qualities that people look for.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.460]   And also, women use what's called in the literature
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.100]   mate choice copying, and this is related in part
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.420]   to the attention structure, that is,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:21.420]   guys who have passed the filters of multiple women,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:28.940]   those are like pre-approved men.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.620]   So we've done studies where you just take a guy,
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.580]   photograph him alone, versus take the same guy,
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.140]   put an attractive woman next to him,
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.940]   or put two women next to him,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.080]   and women judge exactly the same guy
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.860]   to be much more attractive if he's paired with women
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.820]   than if he's not.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.780]   And some guys exploit this in the modern world
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.300]   by hiring wing women to go with them on dates and so forth.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.440]   This is my sister, former girlfriend, or whatever.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.260]   So, but you're correct in that women use multiple cues
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:12.500]   to assess these things, and they change over time.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.620]   So in the modern environment,
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.780]   even things like the attention structure,
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.460]   does this guy have a million Twitter followers
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.180]   or three Twitter followers?
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.740]   So that is an index of the attention structure,
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.700]   and hence the status of the guy within the broader community.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.360]   So, and from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.620]   it's reasonable that women would prioritize these qualities
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.540]   because of the tremendous asymmetry
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.540]   in our reproductive biology,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.020]   namely that fertilization occurs internally within women,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.980]   not within men.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.500]   Women bear the burdens of the nine-month pregnancy,
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.640]   which is metabolically expensive,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.420]   as well as creating opportunity costs
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.300]   in terms of mobility and solving other tasks
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.660]   that people need to solve in the course of their lives.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.260]   And so one way to phrase that is that the costs
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.120]   of making a bad mate choice are much heavier for women
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.380]   when it comes to sexual behavior, certainly,
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.340]   because, and the benefits correspondingly
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.020]   of making a wise mate choice are higher for women
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.380]   in the sexual context.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.300]   But as I said, we have mutual mate choice in our species,
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.340]   and so what do men value more than women?
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.820]   Physical attractiveness.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.380]   - They rank that as a more important criteria
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.740]   than do women about men?
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.100]   - Yes, yeah, exactly.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.140]   - Consistently across cultures.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.640]   - Consistently, and it's not that women
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.460]   are indifferent to it.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.020]   So women do pay attention to a guy's physical appearance,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.320]   his fitness and so forth,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.760]   and guys are actually off base in thinking
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.820]   that women prefer more muscular men than they actually do.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.320]   So like in muscle magazines,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.380]   these men with bulging biceps and so forth,
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.680]   women don't find that especially,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.080]   but they do prioritize fit men,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.800]   a good shoulder to hip ratio
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.160]   and other qualities of physical appearance,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.620]   as well as things like cues to health.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.460]   So physical appearance provides a wealth of information
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.740]   about a person's health status,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.360]   but also provides for men a wealth of information
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.100]   about a woman's fertility, her reproductive value.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.060]   Now, not that men think about that consciously.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.200]   I mean, you men don't walk down the street
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.820]   and see a woman and say, oh, I find her attractive
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.740]   because I think she must be very fertile.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.300]   Maybe a few weird people do that,
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.940]   but most men just, it's like they just find those cues attractive
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.600]   and the cues are cues associated with youth and health,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.620]   because we know that youth is a very powerful cue
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.320]   to fertility and reproductive value.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.100]   So men prioritize physical appearance
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.860]   and in the field of psychology,
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.900]   it used to, what I was taught when I was an undergraduate,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.180]   that you can't judge a book by its cover,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.940]   that physical attractiveness was infinitely arbitrary,
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.980]   infinitely culturally variable,
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.700]   and it's simply not true.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   We know now based on the last 20 years of scientific studies
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.640]   that the cues that men find attractive women
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.600]   are not at all arbitrary.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.080]   There is some variation across cultures,
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.820]   like in relative plumpness versus thinness,
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.940]   but things like clear skin, clear eyes,
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.720]   symmetrical features, a low waist to hip ratio,
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.480]   full lips, lustrous hair,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.200]   all these are qualities that are associated
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.540]   with youth and health and hence have evolved
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.920]   to be part of our standards of attractiveness.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.300]   And so it's not just that men are these superficial creatures
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.920]   who evaluate women on the basis of appearance,
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.580]   there's an underlying logic to why they do so.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.640]   And as I said, relative youth,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.600]   this age thing is one of the largest sex differences
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.820]   you find in long-term age selection
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.600]   with women preferring somewhat older men
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.200]   and men preferring somewhat younger women.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.680]   - Is there a consistent age gap
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.440]   to relate to that statement?
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.600]   - Yes, there is.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   So the age gap though depends on the age of the man.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.760]   So we can document this.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.340]   So in my studies, what we found is that men preferred women
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.300]   who were about three to four years younger than they were
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.900]   on average, and I'll qualify this in a second,
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.080]   women preferred guys who were about three and a half
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.980]   to four and a half years older than they were.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.080]   So there was a sex difference
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.820]   going in the opposite direction.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.560]   But as men get older, they prefer women
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.380]   who are increasingly younger than they are.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.740]   So one way to gauge this,
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.780]   so there are actual marriage statistics
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.840]   and then there are expressed preferences
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.000]   and both sexes kind of converge.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   So if you look at first marriage, second marriage,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.180]   third marriage, as if people get divorced and remarried,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.920]   average age gap is, in America anyway,
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.080]   is three years at first marriage with the guys being older,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.120]   five years at second marriage
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.080]   and eight years at third marriage.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.000]   So that is as men are getting older
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.640]   and getting divorced and remarrying,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.600]   they are marrying women
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.100]   who are increasingly younger than they are.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.980]   In terms of preferences, it's also expressed in preferences.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.980]   So it doesn't go down, so like say a 25-year-old man
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:53.220]   would say prefer a woman who's 20 or in her early 20s.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.440]   35-year-old man might prefer a woman
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.960]   who's in her late 20s or early 30s.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.780]   50-year-old man might prefer a woman who's say 35 to 38.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.080]   So the preferences do go up,
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.960]   but the gap gets increasingly larger.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.460]   And the reason that you don't see things like
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.180]   why aren't men preferring women?
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.940]   So peak fertility in humans is around age 24, 25.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:26.160]   And so you say, well, why aren't the 60-year-old men
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.520]   prioritizing 25-year-old women?
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.000]   Well, as I mentioned, it's a reciprocal,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.980]   mutual mate choice phenomenon.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.740]   - She constrains the equation as you.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.920]   - Well, she constrains it,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.020]   but also marriage and long-term mating
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.780]   are things other than reproductive unions
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.940]   in the modern environment.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.940]   That is, you're supposed to do things as a couple.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.100]   And if you get too large an age gap,
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.500]   then essentially you're in different cultures.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.880]   You know, you grow up with different songs
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.820]   and if the cultural gap gets too large,
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.120]   you don't understand each other.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.760]   So there are constraints on that.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.160]   But if you look at contexts
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.600]   where there are no constraints of that sort,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   so historically kings, emperors, despots, et cetera,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.360]   and I'll give one more modern example,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.520]   they basically prefer young, fertile, attractive females.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.400]   And if they have harems, they stock the harems with those
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.820]   and then circulate them out when they're 30 and so forth.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.560]   And so if you look at marriage systems
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.100]   that are unconstrained,
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.220]   then the preferences are more likely to be revealed
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.180]   or within cultures.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.580]   That is, if you look at men who are in a position
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.020]   to get what they want.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.980]   So as Mick Jagger noted, you can't always get what you want,
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.100]   but if you try sometimes, you get what you need.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.500]   - I hear that most of the time he got what he needed.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.140]   - Right, right, he got what he wanted.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.220]   Yeah, and maybe what he needed.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.320]   If he was in a position, I don't know if he still is,
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.180]   he's in his 70s now, but he was in a position as was,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.300]   let's say Rod Stewart, to take another example,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.980]   or Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.600]   If you were a male who's in a position
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.720]   where there are thousands of women
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.960]   potentially available to you and you can have your pick,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.060]   then you see that clearer expression for younger females.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.880]   There was a chart that was floating around the internet
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.580]   of the girlfriends of Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.700]   As he got older, so he's getting older and older,
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.120]   and the graph of the age of his girlfriends,
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.440]   it basically stayed the same.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.820]   It was in the early 20s or so.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.420]   - He values consistency.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.020]   - He values consistency.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.360]   But so anyway, the data converge on that.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.260]   So these are universal sex differences
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.420]   in long-term mate selection.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.580]   So now when we shift to, oh, and I should mention
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.560]   cultural variability, because that's a critical thing.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.660]   'Cause there is, in my 37 culture study,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.100]   what I found was the preference for virginity,
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.380]   that is no prior sexual experience,
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:18.340]   that was the most variable desire across cultures.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:23.340]   So you had cultures like, at the time of the study, China,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.960]   it was basically indispensable that a partner be a virgin.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.560]   And then at the other end, you have Sweden,
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.220]   where Sweden and Swedes typically place
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.580]   close to zero value on it,
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.680]   and some even find it undesirable.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.300]   Like you're weird if you're a virgin.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.440]   And so you have this whole spectrum.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.920]   - This is virginity in the female, or is this also,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.300]   this is not, in China, was it preference
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.040]   that the male and the female be a virgin?
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.580]   So mutual mate selection.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.880]   - Yeah, it was a preference for both sexes.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.560]   But it's a good question,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.720]   because where there was a sex difference,
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.320]   it was always in the direction of males
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.760]   preferring virginity more than females.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.600]   And we've gone back to China.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.160]   So I still do research in China, among other places.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.480]   And we've gone back and retested modern urban populations.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.820]   And the importance of virginity has gone down in China,
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.660]   especially in the urban areas.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.640]   And the sex difference that didn't exist before
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.880]   has now emerged, where males value it more than females.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.720]   And I think part of it was, in previous times,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.360]   you hit ceiling effects, where both sexes say,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.800]   "Yeah, it's absolutely important to be a virgin."
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.320]   So there's cultural variation and cultural change over time
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.020]   in some of these qualities.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.180]   But the sex differences that I described
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.520]   have remained invariant over the years.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.840]   So since my 37 culture study, this has been replicated
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.040]   in at least a couple dozen different cultures.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   And we've gone back to some of the cultures.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   So I mentioned we've gone back to China, Brazil, and India
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.560]   to look at cultural changes over time.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.720]   And there have been, in some cases,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.060]   dramatic cultural changes over time.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.120]   But the sex differences that I described are invariant.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.160]   They haven't changed a bit.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.840]   - I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about truth-telling
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.720]   and deception, because some of the measures
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.920]   that you're describing, age, for instance,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.420]   one can potentially lie about, right?
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.980]   I'm guessing that there are people who do that
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.200]   on online profiles and whatnot.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.020]   From what I understand, people also lie about height
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.080]   and other features on online profiles.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.720]   But some of them are much harder to hide, right?
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.160]   Eventually, the truth comes out about some,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.640]   if not all of these things.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   So if you would, could you tell us about how men and women
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.600]   leverage deception versus truth-telling and communicating
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.920]   some of the things around mate choice selection?
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   - Yeah, well, so basically, both men and women do deceive.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.800]   So we have the modern cultural invention of online dating,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.960]   which was little used 10 years ago
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.480]   and virtually absent 20 years ago.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.180]   And people do lie, but they lie in predictable ways.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.660]   They lie in ways that attempt to embody
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.040]   the mate preferences of the person they're trying to attract.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.000]   And so men do lie.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.560]   They deceive about their income, their status.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.200]   So they exaggerate their income by about 20%.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.600]   They tack on about two inches to their height.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.160]   So if they're 5'10", they round up to six feet.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   So they don't, like if they're 5'10",
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   they don't say that they're gigantic,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.140]   but they kind of round it up
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.380]   in the more desirable direction.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.960]   Women tend to deceive about weight.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.320]   So they tend to shave about 15 pounds
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   off of their reported weight.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   And both sexes post photos that are not truly representative
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.000]   of what they actually look like.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.320]   So they might post photos of themselves when they were younger
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   or they're even advice tips on how to create the best selfie
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:28.480]   of the best angle that will maximally enhance
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.400]   what you look like.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.080]   - Or just doctoring of photos, I'm guessing.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.460]   - Yeah, yeah, photoshopping, absolutely.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.160]   And one of the things about it,
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.320]   now you say like, well, do people find out?
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.160]   Of course, people do find out.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.960]   I mean, I'll just give you one story
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.200]   about a colleague of mine who was doing,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.120]   is a male who's doing internet dating.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.960]   And he picked only women who self-described as sevens
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.800]   on the one to seven on attractiveness.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.120]   So the most attractive as self-reported.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.560]   And so, and he went out with this one woman
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.480]   and she was missing her front teeth.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.440]   And he said, well, call me picky,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.480]   but I'm missing her front teeth.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.040]   And she thinks she's like the top of her drag.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.800]   He was a little disappointed about that.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.480]   And women of course are disappointed.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.320]   They meet a guy who they think is this physically fit,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.960]   you know, athletic guy.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.320]   And he comes up, he's 300 pounds and overweight.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.560]   So people do find out.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.840]   And so, and there are some internet dating sites
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   have kind of a vetting of the accuracy of something.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.080]   So some things you can look up through public records
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.600]   and does this guy have a criminal record for example?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   Is he on a sexual offenders website?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.680]   So there's some things you can verify,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.000]   but what I tell people is you really have to meet the person
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   and interact, you know, in part because of the deception,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   but also because what happens with internet dating
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.920]   is that the photograph tends to overwhelm
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.040]   all the other cues and all the other cues
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.600]   are written statements.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.200]   And we weren't really evolved to process written statements,
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.000]   but we were evolved to respond to physical cues.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   But, and men tend to attend to the visual cues
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.600]   much more than women.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.480]   So women in their mate selection,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.880]   they have olfactory cues to what does the guy sound like?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.300]   Is it vocal qualities?
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:41.000]   That's auditory cues, but olfactory cues,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.320]   what does he smell like?
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.080]   And so women have a more acute sense of smell than men do.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.680]   And so if the guy doesn't smell right,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.960]   even if he embodies all the other qualities women want,
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.120]   that's a deal breaker.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.720]   And so I encourage people just, you know,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.320]   stop with the hundred texts back and forth or messaging
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.360]   and meet a person for a cup of coffee and interact.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.640]   And then you'll, you know,
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.760]   you'll get a more accurate beat on the person.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.880]   And then of course, some qualities you can't assess
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.120]   even with a half hour interaction, you can tell a lot,
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.040]   but things like emotional stability
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.840]   are things that have to be assessed over time.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.560]   And so one of the things that I advise people to do,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.180]   and I'm not in the advice giving business,
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.520]   but people ask me all the time,
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.000]   once they find out what I studied,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.880]   they say, well, Tom, I got this problem,
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.240]   can you give me advice?
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.780]   But one of the things to assess things
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.480]   like emotional stability,
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.000]   which is absolutely critical in long-term mating,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.200]   is to do something like go on a trip together,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.780]   take a vacation where you're even in an unfamiliar
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.720]   environment where you have to cope with things
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.920]   that you're not familiar with,
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.800]   and as opposed to an environment where it's very predictable
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.280]   and so you get a greater exposure
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   because one of the hallmarks of emotional instability
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.560]   is how they respond to stress.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.860]   So emotionally unstable people tend to have a long latency
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.480]   to return to baseline after a stressful event.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.480]   And so this is the sort of information
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.440]   you can't get on a coffee date.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.360]   You know, you can only get by assessing it over time.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.040]   - So somebody who's laboratory studies stress and tools
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.440]   to combat stress, that's great.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.920]   It's yet more incentive for people to develop
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.880]   self-regulatory mechanisms for themselves.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:42.200]   I'm guessing many of the features of deception
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.560]   in this context were present long before internet dating.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.720]   And so is it, it's somewhat dark to think about,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.600]   but is deception built into this dance
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.920]   that we call mate selection and has it been built in
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.560]   for a long time or is this something that you think
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.800]   has emerged more as people are approaching each other
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.840]   through these electronic web-based mediums?
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.500]   - Yeah, I mean, some forms of deception have been there
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.880]   for a long time over human evolutionary history.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.200]   So one form of deception which we haven't mentioned
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.040]   is deception about whether you're interested
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.800]   in a long-term committed relationship
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.120]   or a short-term hookup.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.600]   And so there's deception about that,
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.040]   especially on the part of men.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.200]   So men who are interested, like on Tinder,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.180]   it has been reported, although Tinder denies this,
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.840]   there's been reported that something like 30% of the men
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.720]   on Tinder are either married
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.560]   or in long-term committed relationships
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.080]   and they're looking for something on the side.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.080]   But in terms of successfully attracting a mate,
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   the over-display that, hey, I'm interested
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.400]   in just a short-term hookup, I'm interested in sex,
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.560]   so I wanna have sex right now,
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.680]   let's just go back to my apartment,
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.080]   these are very ineffective tactics.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.840]   And so effective tactics for men
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.200]   are often displaying cues to long-term interest.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.040]   And so, and of course that's effective for a woman
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.500]   who's seeking a long-term interest.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.200]   And so that's a deception.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.380]   So we find in our studies of deception
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.560]   that men tend to exaggerate the depths of their feelings
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.180]   for a woman, exaggerate how similar they are
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.280]   and how aligned they are in their values
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   and religious orientations and political values
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.240]   and so forth.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.280]   And so I think there's deception around that.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.520]   And I think that's probably
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.160]   an evolutionarily recurrent form of deception
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.320]   that women have defenses against, by the way.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.880]   But I think that modern internet dating
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.620]   opens the door for certain types of deception
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.920]   that were, at a minimum,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.680]   were difficult to accomplish ancestrally.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   So things like Photoshopping wasn't available back then.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.240]   Plus, we evolved in the context of small group living
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.660]   where you not only had your own personal observations
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.640]   of someone's qualities, you had also your relatives,
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.660]   your friends, allies,
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.160]   the social reputation that someone had.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.380]   And these are all critical sources of information
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.140]   that are less available in modern environments
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.320]   because people migrate, they move from place to place,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.460]   they can close down one internet profile and put up another,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.400]   or they could have six going simultaneously.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.320]   So the modern environment opens up the door
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.500]   for forms of deception that weren't available
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.480]   or weren't available to the same degree ancestrally.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.120]   - I see. Very interesting.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.340]   Would you mind touching on some of the features
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:05.340]   that are selected for in terms of sexual partner choice?
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:09.480]   We talked a little bit about mate choice,
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.140]   but in terms of sexual partner choice,
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.600]   are there any good studies exploring
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.300]   what people are selecting for?
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.140]   Or is it that they are both just in a state
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.140]   of pure hypothalamic drive, I'm a neuroscientist after all,
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.380]   and therefore it's hard to recreate in the laboratory?
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.060]   - Well, no, we do know something about that,
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.740]   and we know something about how the preferences
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.940]   for a sex partner differ from preference for a long-term mate.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.020]   There is overlap, of course,
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.700]   but one thing is physical appearance.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.900]   So physical appearance for women is important
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.220]   in long-term mating, not as important as it is for men,
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:54.240]   but it becomes more important in short-term mating.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.780]   And so is the guy good-looking?
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.360]   So those physical attributes are more important for women.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.940]   They remain important for men,
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.120]   physical appearance in short-term mating,
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.940]   but with the footnote that men are willing
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.260]   to drop their standards in short-term mating,
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.260]   if it's low commitment, low risk, just sex,
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.100]   without entangling commitments.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:30.160]   Women are more likely to prioritize
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.020]   what I call bad boy qualities,
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.020]   so guys who are very self-confident,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.960]   guys who are strut, guys who are a little arrogant,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.580]   guys who are risk-taking, guys who defy conventions,
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.980]   women are more attracted to those guys
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.000]   in short-term mating than long-term mating,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.800]   and whereas in long-term mating,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.100]   they go more for the good dad qualities.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.500]   Is this guy dependable?
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.760]   Is he gonna be a good father to my children?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.520]   And then also, in short-term mating,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.520]   women use that mate-copying heuristic.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.980]   That is, if there are thousands of other women
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.020]   who find him attractive, women find him attractive.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.380]   And so that's why you have the groupie phenomenon.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.420]   So with the rock stars, for example,
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.460]   there are thousands of screaming women,
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.560]   all of whom wanna sleep with this famous rock star,
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.100]   and they use that as information.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.060]   They find, if you took like a still photo
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.500]   of some of these rock stars
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.940]   and asked women how attractive the guy is
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.520]   versus tell 'em he's a famous rock star
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.060]   and show the thousands of women screaming at him,
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.820]   they judge him entirely differently
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.720]   in terms of his attractiveness.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.880]   So even, and this is an important point
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.980]   that women's attraction to men is more context-specific
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.740]   and varies more across contexts
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.460]   than men's attraction to women.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.340]   And so I'll give you just an example of that.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:09.020]   This is a female colleague of mine went to a conference,
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.220]   an academic conference,
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.020]   and she found the organizer of this conference
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.600]   to be really attractive and then saw him six months later
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.660]   and wondered, well, what was I thinking?
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.460]   He doesn't seem very attractive at all.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.540]   And what it was is, when he was the organizer,
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.860]   he was at the center of the attention structure.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.060]   He was the guy up on stage directing everybody
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.900]   and everyone was attending to him.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.220]   And then when he was just a normal presenter at a conference,
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.580]   he didn't command the attention structure
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.800]   like he did in that when he was the organizer.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.060]   And so this is just an illustration
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.300]   of how circumstance-dependent
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.780]   women's made attraction is for guys.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:54.000]   It depends on his status,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.300]   the number of women that are attracted to him,
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.460]   the attention structure is how he interacts
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.740]   with a puppy or a baby.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.820]   If he's ignoring a baby in distress
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.880]   or positively interacting with a young child.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:13.660]   All these things, whereas for men, it almost doesn't matter.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.300]   Context is more irrelevant.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.220]   They're honing in on the specific psychophysical cues
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.180]   that the woman is displaying in context be damned.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.280]   - Very interesting.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:31.780]   Let's talk about infidelity in committed relationships.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:36.860]   What are some of the consistent findings around reasons for
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:41.140]   and maybe even long-term consequences
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.740]   of infidelity for men and women?
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.860]   And this could be marriage or long-term partnership
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.380]   or infidelity of any kind, I suppose.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.220]   - Yeah, so well--
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.420]   - I'm guessing it does happen.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, well that's--
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.140]   - How frequent is it?
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.820]   - Yeah, that's the interesting thing.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.860]   - Well, how frequent it is is difficult to gauge
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.860]   because it's one of the forms of human conduct
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.140]   that people like to keep secret.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:11.300]   So if you go back now, let's say 70 years
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.700]   to the classic Kinsey studies,
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.100]   the questions about infidelity were the questions
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.780]   that most people refused to answer
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.820]   and when the question was brought up
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.020]   caused more people to drop out of the study.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.580]   And so that kind of tells you something
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.860]   that I mean, what do people conceal?
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.420]   Infidelity, incest, murder, there is a small handful
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.740]   of things that people universally wanna conceal
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.380]   and infidelity is one of them.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:42.140]   But people do it and so Kinsey estimated 26%
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.020]   of married women committed an infidelity
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.380]   at some point during their marriage and about 50% of men.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.140]   Other studies have given lower figures
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.500]   and so the exact figures bounce around depending
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.980]   on anonymity provided and how comfortable they are
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.100]   with the interviewer and so forth.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.340]   - And by infidelity, does that mean intercourse
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.540]   with somebody else?
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.660]   So we're not talking about quote unquote emotional affairs.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.180]   We're talking about sex with somebody other
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.060]   than their committed partner with unbeknownst
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:13.900]   to their partner.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.740]   - Right, right and there are other forms of infidelity
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.580]   which we could get into including emotional infidelity
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.300]   and financial infidelity.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.660]   But here we're just talking about for the moment,
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.580]   sexual infidelity and the interesting thing
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:30.580]   about sexual infidelity is that the sexes really differ
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:36.460]   fundamentally in the motives for committing infidelity.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:41.380]   So for men, the primary motive and these are
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.140]   on average sex differences.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.820]   So whenever I talk about sex differences,
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:47.340]   I'm talking about on average sex differences
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.860]   'cause there's overlap in the distributions
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.100]   and but so these are generalizations
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.580]   of which there are exceptions.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:59.580]   So for men, it's mainly a matter of sexual variety.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:05.700]   So about 70% of the men, the opportunity presented itself.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.500]   I was out of town and I had this opportunity.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:13.180]   So low risk, low cost pursuit of sexual variety,
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.420]   sexual novelty is a key motivation for men.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.260]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:22.260]   So 70% of men that cheat, that's the primary cause
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.060]   or is it that 70% of men do cheat?
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.820]   - No, no, no, of the men who cheat 70%,
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.380]   thank you for that clarification,
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.380]   of the men who do cheat 70%, cite that as the key motive,
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.100]   the key reason why they committed an infidelity.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.020]   - Sort of like why mountain climbers climb mountains
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.060]   'cause they're there.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.940]   - Right, right, because they're there.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.980]   Well, the comedian, I think it was Chris Rock said,
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.140]   "Men are only as faithful as their opportunity."
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.020]   - Or how available their password on their phone is
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.020]   to their partner.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.500]   - Right, right, yeah.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:01.500]   So but, and that's an exaggeration but if you look at women,
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.700]   this just desire for pure novelty, sexual variety
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.620]   is much less of a motive
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:15.380]   but women who have affairs cite that they're unhappy
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:19.820]   with their primary relationship, emotionally unhappy
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.700]   or sexually unhappy and typically both.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.500]   And this may seem like totally obvious that,
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.340]   well, of course, people if they're unhappy
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.860]   in the relationship are more likely to stray
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.380]   but in fact, it's not true for men.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:35.740]   So if you compare men who are happy with their marriage
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.580]   and men who are not happy with their marriage,
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.060]   there's no difference in their infidelity rates.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:44.940]   And I think it goes down to that issue of motive
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.620]   or seeking variety.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.460]   So now, why do women do it?
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.740]   Because it's a risky endeavor.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:56.900]   She risks her long-term mate or losing long-term mate.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.420]   It's risky in terms of reputational damage for both sexes.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.220]   So it's a risky thing.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.620]   Why do women do it?
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:09.620]   And there are two competing hypotheses, at least two
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.020]   but there are two primary competing hypotheses
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.820]   in the evolutionary literature.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.700]   One is called the dual mating strategy hypothesis
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.580]   where women are seeking to get resources and investment
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:24.580]   from one guy and good genes from another guy.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.580]   So and in principle, that can work.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.460]   And I initially, this wasn't a hypothesis original with me.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.260]   This is Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.420]   and some others of Marty Hazleton, a former student of mine
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.860]   have advocated this dual mating strategy hypothesis.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.700]   And originally, I was endorsed it
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.140]   because the data seemed to support it.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.740]   We can get into which data seemed to support it.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.820]   But over time, I became more and more dubious
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.860]   about this hypothesis and instead have advocated
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.660]   what I call the mate switching hypothesis.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:05.660]   And so if you look at a whole host of information
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   around why women have affairs, it's not compatible
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.820]   with the dual mating strategy hypothesis.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.300]   So and is compatible with the mate switching
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   that is women who are looking to either divest themselves
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:25.580]   from an existing mateship or trade up in the mating market
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.780]   to a mate who's more compatible with them
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:32.100]   or higher in mate value, or simply see
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.540]   whether they're sufficiently desirable
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:38.460]   so that it eases the transition into the mating pool
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.900]   or keeping a mate as a potential backup mate,
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.220]   what I call mate insurance.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.300]   So you have car insurance if something bad happens
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.180]   to your car, house insurance.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.060]   We also have mate insurance, you know, keeping someone.
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.860]   One woman said, men are like soup.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.700]   You always want to have one on the back burner.
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:02.700]   So whether that's the best analogy or not, I'm not sure,
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:08.060]   but it kind of captures something about why.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.540]   So, well, what evidence am I talking about?
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.460]   Well, for one thing, women who have affairs,
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.060]   and this is about 70% of them, they-
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.860]   - Again, sorry, just I want to make sure people,
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.420]   of women who have affairs.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.380]   - Of the women who have affairs.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:26.100]   So let's say ballpark Kinsey was, let's say roughly right,
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.700]   25, 26% of women will have affairs.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.300]   Let's just assume that he's right.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.340]   And we don't know exactly, but of the women
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.660]   who do have affairs, about 70% say they have fallen
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.020]   in love with their affair partner.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.060]   They become deeply emotionally involved
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.620]   with their affair partner.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.380]   And to me, if you're just trying to get good genes
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.260]   from a guy, that is the last thing you want to do
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.740]   is fall in love with them or get emotionally involved.
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.780]   But it's very compatible if you want to switch mates.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:04.140]   And so that's sort of, that's one piece of evidence
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:08.820]   that suggests that women, the mate switching function
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.220]   of infidelity is a more likely explanation.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:15.140]   Now these two are not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.500]   In other words, it's possible that some women
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.140]   do pursue a dual mating strategy hypothesis,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.660]   but there's other evidence that suggests,
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.540]   so for example, what are the actual rates
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.180]   of genetic cuckoldry?
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.620]   Well, in the modern environment anyway, they're pretty low.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.740]   It turns out they're like two to 3%.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.060]   - Could you just explain for the audience
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.340]   what genetic cuckoldry is?
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:42.020]   - So this is where the woman, where the man believes
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.980]   he is the genetic father of a child,
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.500]   but it turns out he's not, might be the mailman
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.340]   or the next door neighbor or the guy
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.900]   she's having an affair with.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   So mistaken paternity and genetic cuckoldry
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:59.420]   is just one way to capture.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.220]   - Named after the cuckoo bird, right?
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.820]   - Named after the cuckoo bird, yes.
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.140]   - Who sneaks its eggs into the nest of the other,
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:09.060]   rolls, destroys the future offspring of the bird
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.780]   and then basically offloads all the work
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.660]   onto another father.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.860]   - Parasitizes, yeah, the parental investment
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.940]   of a different bird species.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:24.940]   So anyway, so I think that, and there's other sources
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.140]   of evidence that I think point,
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.100]   so one of the sources of evidence that initially
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:34.060]   seemed to support the dual mating strategy hypothesis
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.340]   was ovulation shifts.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:40.740]   So in other words, it looked like from the early studies
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.220]   that when women are ovulating,
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:45.100]   these are among non pill-taking women,
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.540]   women not on hormonal contraceptives,
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.460]   that they experienced a preference shift toward more men
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.780]   who were masculine and symmetrical,
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.460]   which were hypothesized markers for good genes.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.540]   And there's an explanation for that.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.260]   But it turns out the effects of ovulation
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.700]   on women's mate preferences are far weaker
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.860]   than the initial studies looked like.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.220]   And in fact, some larger scale studies have failed
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.220]   to replicate them entirely.
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:18.100]   And so that was one of the key sources of evidence,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:21.140]   these ovulation shifts that women were going after good genes
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.260]   because it's only when she's ovulating
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:28.860]   and she can get pregnant by having sex with another man,
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.100]   that it would make sense for her
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.980]   to have sex with another man.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.940]   And there was even some early evidence
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.260]   that women were timing their affairs,
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.180]   timing sex with their affair partners
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.180]   to coincide with when they were ovulating.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.540]   But as I said, some of these subsequent studies
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.340]   have failed to replicate these early findings
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.180]   calling into question the dual mating strategy notion.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.460]   And so I think I've shifted my views on this
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:59.500]   and now endorse the mate switching hypothesis
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.980]   as a more likely explanation for why most women have affairs.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.700]   - Well, the way you describe this makes me wonder
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:10.500]   if of the women that have affairs,
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.020]   do those affairs tend to be more long lasting
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.420]   than the affairs that men have?
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.780]   Because the way you describe it is
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.860]   men are seizing an opportunity
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.900]   to sort of a carpe diem type approach to infidelity.
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:24.140]   And women potentially on average
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.860]   are capitalizing on something that is longer term.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.860]   Now, of course, if they're doing this around ovulation,
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.580]   then it would constrain the amount of times
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.380]   they would need to see or have sex
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.100]   with this other person that they're not married to.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.660]   But is there any evidence
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.380]   that women have more ongoing affairs
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.780]   and men have more transient affairs?
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.020]   - Yes, yeah, there is.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.100]   And so if you look at people who have affairs,
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:50.780]   there's a sex difference there.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:54.860]   So that women tend to have affairs with one person
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.260]   and become emotionally involved
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.380]   with that one person over time.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.380]   Men who have affairs tend to have affairs
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.100]   with a larger number of affair partners.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.660]   And so, which then by definition can't be long lasting.
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.340]   You can't have long-term affairs
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.700]   with six different partners.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.780]   - Yeah, unless he's juggling multiple phone accounts
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.620]   or something of that sort. - Right, right, right.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.100]   And some men try to do that,
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:21.260]   but I think it could be very taxing.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.940]   - Yeah, well, and in this day and age,
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:26.500]   it's easier to meet more people
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.540]   by virtue of online communications,
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.460]   but it's also easier to get caught,
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.700]   meaning it's harder to conceal interactions.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.060]   Everything's in the cloud anyway.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.700]   A good friend of mine who's a former very high level
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.980]   in special operations said,
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:43.020]   "Anything that's not in your head and only in your head
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.540]   "is available for others to find should they want it."
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:47.380]   - Yeah.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.900]   - And I think that's largely true.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   - Yeah, and yeah, so fun information, text messages,
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:57.860]   and people are very good at hacking into their partners'
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.180]   phones, computers.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.060]   And then also there are video cameras everywhere.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:05.380]   So sneaking off to this, a quiet restaurant,
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.580]   I mean, there are probably eight video cameras
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.500]   that can record you walking in and out of that restaurant.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.980]   - Everything can be found.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:13.820]   - Yes.
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:14.980]   - I'm certain of that.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.060]   - You mentioned emotional affairs
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.300]   and financial infidelity as well.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.260]   - Yes.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:25.140]   - I had a girlfriend once who as a early date discussion
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:29.100]   said, "Not that I get the impression that you are,
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:30.500]   "but I want to be very clear."
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.940]   She said, "That you are not emotionally, physically,
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.380]   "or financially tied to any other women."
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.540]   And I thought it was very interesting
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.660]   that now you bring up financial infidelity.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.660]   She's quite happily partnered now and not with me,
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.860]   but it's interesting, it's the first time I heard anyone
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.380]   spell it out that way as a list,
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.220]   almost like specific aims in a grant.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.660]   What is emotional infidelity?
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.580]   What is financial infidelity?
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.860]   - Yeah, yeah, well, this is a very smart woman.
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:58.700]   - Indeed she is.
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.540]   - To tap into all three.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.380]   - Yeah, indeed she is.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.940]   - So, and I assumed you gave honest responses
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.660]   to all of those three questions.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.260]   - As I recall, I did, but as we now know that they're,
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.700]   well, you can ask her at some point.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.540]   - Right, right, okay.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.940]   - And there is self-deception and the service of deception
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:16.980]   that is another issue.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.380]   So emotional infidelity is basically
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.700]   exactly what it sounds like.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.780]   It's falling in love with someone else,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.220]   becoming psychologically close to someone else,
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:32.220]   sharing intimate or private information with someone else.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.780]   That's what I mean by emotional infidelity.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.860]   And one of the hallmarks of this,
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.420]   a study done by a former student of mine, Barry Cooley,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.740]   was very clever, I thought.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.900]   He analyzed, there used to be this reality TV show
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.820]   called Cheaters, where they would hire detectives
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.420]   and they would, when the detective would like say,
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.820]   follow someone to a hotel room, they'd call up the partner
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:00.180]   and say, your husband just walked into the hotel room
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.660]   with someone else, would you like to come down
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.340]   to the hotel and confront him?
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.380]   And a certain percentage of people would confront.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.500]   And what he analyzed, so he analyzed all these episodes
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.740]   of this show called Cheaters,
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.180]   and what he examined was the verbal interrogations
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.340]   when people confronted their partners.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.860]   And when men confronted their partners,
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.300]   the first question they wanted to know is, did you fuck him?
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:29.500]   Women, their first question was, do you love her?
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.420]   And so this kind of captures that difference
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.020]   between a sexual infidelity and emotional infidelity,
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:38.340]   and also kind of captures another sex difference
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.540]   when it comes to sexual jealousy,
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.780]   where men tend to be more focused on the sexual components
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:49.780]   of the infidelity, because those are what compromise
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:53.780]   his paternity certainty, his certainty that he's actual,
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.780]   actually the genetic father of whatever offspring ensue.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:03.140]   Whereas love is a cue to, do you love her?
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.180]   That's a cue that he's gonna leave you, the woman,
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:11.180]   for another woman is a cue to the long-term loss
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:15.500]   of that investment and commitment from that partner.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:20.500]   And so the sexes seem to differ in which aspects
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:25.060]   of the infidelity with women were attuned to more upset
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.660]   by the emotional infidelity,
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.420]   men more by the sexual infidelity.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.880]   Now, financial infidelity has been explored much less,
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.900]   but in my new book, When Men Behave Badly,
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.780]   I have a section on financial infidelity,
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.340]   where I summarize all the research that has been done.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.060]   And I was kind of flabbergasted by the percentage of people
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.620]   who do things like have credit cards
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.500]   that their spouse doesn't know about,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.540]   keep secret bank accounts,
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.840]   have the credit card bills mailed to their office
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.920]   rather than their home,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   have basically resources and expenditures of pooled resources
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.540]   that they keep from their partner.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.660]   And both sexes do it.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:10.060]   And the percentages vary from study to study,
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.520]   but they range from like 30 to 60% of all people
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.300]   who are keeping financial information from their spouse
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.140]   in one way or another.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.260]   It could be the woman's out buying designer purses
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.780]   or designer handbags.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.260]   It could be the guy's out going to strip clubs
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.960]   or taking his affair partner to restaurants
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.620]   and doesn't want those charges to show up on,
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.540]   you know, a jointly held credit card.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.600]   So financial infidelity is critical.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.340]   And then even things like diverting pooled resources
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.260]   to one set of genetic relatives versus another set
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:52.000]   is another thing that people tend to keep secret.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.360]   So there are forms of financial infidelity as well.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.440]   So yeah, infidelity, you're absolutely,
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.540]   it's a great question because it shouldn't be confined
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.060]   to sexual infidelity, which is what most people think about,
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.660]   but also emotional and financial.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.820]   Interestingly, if you ask people, what do you mean,
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:15.060]   what is infidelity in a marriage?
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.160]   Men tend to say, well, it's obvious
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.040]   that she has sex with someone else.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.760]   That's infidelity.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.300]   Whereas women are more likely to have a broader definition
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.320]   of infidelity, they will cite things
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.180]   like emotional infidelity, financial infidelity
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.580]   as part of the definition.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.420]   Whereas men have that more narrow definition.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.260]   - Interesting.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.820]   I have a good friend who's a couples counselor,
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.460]   a clinical psychologist.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.300]   And she told me something interesting that relates to this,
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.840]   which is that in cases of infidelity,
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.120]   oftentimes some of the arguments between couples
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.980]   boil down to whether or not contraception was used or not.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.220]   That becomes a key feature.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.580]   And she always thought that that was, you know,
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.540]   homing in on a detail, which of course is an important detail
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.720]   as it relates to both paternity issues and pregnancy,
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.940]   but also disease, right?
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.020]   But as we're talking about all this,
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.460]   it makes me think that this may have deeper
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.660]   evolutionary roots in our, further down in the brain,
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.980]   as we say, in neuroscience literature.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.580]   - And yeah, and I mean, using a condom versus
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.220]   not using a condom, not using as a more intimate act
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.820]   in a way you were literally physically more intimate
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.740]   with someone else than if you do use a condom.
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.740]   So, you know, but whether evolutionary roots to this,
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.940]   I don't know.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:45.060]   I mean, condoms are probably relatively recent
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.340]   or at least a widespread use of them
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:50.620]   are relatively recent in evolutionary times.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.440]   So I doubt we have adaptations specifically for them.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.420]   - No, and presumably before condoms,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.800]   and one can only speculate because as we say,
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.080]   when it comes to behavior, there's rarely a fossil record,
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.120]   but sometimes there is,
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.140]   it would be the withdrawal method of contraception,
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.220]   which a good friend of mine who studies,
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.520]   whose laboratory works on reproductive biology says,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.240]   the reason that's a poor choice of contraception
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.220]   is because it was designed not to work.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.060]   [laughing]
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:17.900]   - Yes.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.520]   - So note to those of trying to avoid unwanted pregnancy.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.140]   So we talked a little bit about status
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.340]   in terms of what men and women are selecting
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.660]   for different types of relationships.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.260]   Is there anything else about status
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.440]   that you find particularly interesting
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.780]   and, you know, what men are finding attractive
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.900]   besides these, you know, waist to hip ratios
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.900]   and quality of potential mothers and so forth?
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.280]   Are there any kind of hidden gems in the literature
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.300]   around this that I might not have heard of?
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:56.320]   - Well, yeah, so you mean among, you know,
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.540]   things like sex differences and what leads to high status or-
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:05.540]   - For instance, or what, or perhaps things that are surprising
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:09.180]   in terms of what people are selecting for.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.020]   Do people even know what they're selecting for?
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.780]   This is, or is this all subconscious?
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.380]   Any and all of those topics are of interest to me.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:18.380]   - Yeah, so well, to take them in reverse order,
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.180]   you know, I think a lot of it is conscious,
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.660]   but some of it is certainly unconscious.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.260]   Or there are elements which are totally unconscious.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:31.100]   So I mentioned one earlier where a man looks at a woman,
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.480]   he's not, he's aware that he's attracted to her
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.160]   and attracted to her physical appearance,
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.380]   but he might not be aware of why.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.580]   You know, we didn't evolve to be aware of why.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.420]   Just like with food preferences,
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.780]   we find certain things delectable
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.860]   and other things nauseating.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.740]   We don't understand the adaptive logic
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.620]   of why our food preferences exist and why we have them.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.220]   And the same is true of mating, you know?
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:02.220]   And so men find women with a low waist tip ratio attractive,
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:07.860]   but they might not, they almost rarely,
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.060]   rarely will they know, oh, low waist waist tip ratio
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.860]   is actually associated with higher fertility,
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.020]   lower endocrinological problems,
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.020]   lower age, et cetera.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.980]   So we're sometimes aware of what we want,
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.700]   but we are unaware of why we want it.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.240]   So I think there are unconscious elements
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.860]   that the whole topic of status
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.460]   and what leads to high status and low status,
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.620]   it's a topic I'm currently investigating.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.220]   Published a couple scientific articles on it.
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.460]   And so, but maybe we'll hold off on that
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.500]   for a future discussion.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.460]   But it intersects, I'll mention one,
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:51.700]   it intersects with mating in interesting ways
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:56.700]   in that higher status gives people the ability
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:02.340]   to choose from a wider pool of potential mates
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.340]   than they would if they have low status.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.740]   And so one of the reasons that people strive for status
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.220]   is because they have access to more desirable mates.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:17.220]   Conversely, having desirable mates
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.500]   endows you with higher status.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.380]   And so if you have, if you're a male,
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:25.180]   you have a very attractive woman on your arm
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.020]   that leads to high status.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.260]   And so there's a reciprocal link between status
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.220]   and mating in that way.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.580]   And there've been studies where you say they pose
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:38.580]   a kind of an unattractive guy, older unattractive guy
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.780]   and a stunningly beautiful woman as a girlfriend.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:46.580]   And they say, well, what's this guy all about?
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.300]   And they say, oh, he must be very high in status.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.420]   He must be very wealthy.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.940]   He must have a lot going for him.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.820]   You know, whereas the reverse,
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.940]   people don't make the same attributions.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.380]   And so there is an interesting reciprocal link
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.700]   between status and mating success
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.580]   where mating success leads to high status
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.580]   and high status leads to more mating success.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.780]   - So over and over again,
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.540]   there are these instances that you described
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.900]   where the assessment of potential mate sexual
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.460]   or long-term partnership are being made
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.020]   in the contents of good statistical practices,
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.700]   looking at the choices of others
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.260]   as a readout of your own choices.
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.460]   I keep, this seems to be a theme that this is not being made
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.420]   in a very narrow context, but paying attention
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.060]   to what other people are paying attention to
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.700]   seems to come up again and again.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.140]   Slightly off center from that,
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.820]   but still paying attention to what other people
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.020]   are paying attention to.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.100]   What's known about jealousy in men versus women
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.380]   and how frequent it is, how intense it is,
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.460]   and what people do with that jealousy.
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.220]   I mean, we hear, or I've heard at some point
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.420]   that a large fraction of homicides
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.020]   are the consequence of jealous lovers.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:03.580]   That's the darkest angle of all this,
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.580]   but in evolutionary psychology context, what is jealousy?
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:13.140]   Does it relate to paternity issues only?
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.020]   What can you tell us about that?
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.940]   - Yeah, so, well, it's a great set of questions.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.860]   And when I first started studying jealousy,
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.100]   I reviewed all the prior publications on jealousy.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.500]   And at that time, jealousy was regarded
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.580]   as a sign of immaturity,
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.220]   a sign of insecurity,
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:38.300]   a sign of neurosis or pathology,
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.740]   or in some cases, delusion.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:46.180]   And what I argued is, and do argue,
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.180]   is that jealousy is an evolved emotion
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.540]   that serves several adaptive functions, okay?
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.220]   One of which you mentioned is a paternity certainty function.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.420]   But to back up a second,
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.540]   basically, once you have the evolution of long-term mating,
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.580]   long-term pair bonds, you're talking about,
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.220]   from a male perspective,
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.620]   investing a tremendous amount of resources
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:13.780]   in a woman and her children over years or decades,
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.220]   even with boomerang kids now,
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.780]   it may go more than two decades.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.740]   - Boomerang kids?
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.820]   - Yeah, kids who leave home
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.260]   and then come back and live at home.
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:24.100]   - That happens?
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.500]   - 'Cause they, oh yeah, that happens.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.620]   - I don't have children, so I--
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.140]   - Okay, yeah, no, that's a big thing.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.380]   But if I do, I'll just expect
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.020]   that they'll come back at some point.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.100]   - They'll come back 'cause they can't find a job
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.940]   or they find it cheaper to live at the parents' house
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:37.780]   or whatever.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:39.060]   - Oh goodness, I can't think of anything worse.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.300]   I mean, I love my parents, but.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.180]   - I know, I know, I can't imagine, but it happens.
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.060]   And it's happening more and more
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.340]   given the current economic situation.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.740]   Okay, but, so once you have long-term mating,
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:57.620]   you need a defense to prevent
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.420]   or preserve the investment that you've made
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.500]   and are making in long-term mateship.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.620]   And so jealousy serves this mate guarding function,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.940]   if you will, or mate retention function.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.940]   So in other words, one way of phrasing this
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.900]   is that we know that there are affairs,
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.260]   we know that people break up, they get divorced,
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.700]   but people have adaptations
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:23.860]   to wanna hold on to their mates, okay?
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.780]   And that's what jealousy is in part about.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.620]   And so jealousy gets activated
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.260]   when there are threats to that romantic relationship.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:33.420]   And there are other forms of jealousy
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.020]   like sibling jealousy and so forth,
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.420]   but we're focusing on mating jealousy in this context.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.780]   So now what's interesting is that the threats
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.380]   to an ongoing valued romantic relationship
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.100]   come from many sources.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.980]   So they could be you detect cues
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.140]   to your partner's infidelity
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:58.740]   or cues of a lack of an emotional distance
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.460]   between you and your partner.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:03.020]   You say, "I love you" to your partner
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.700]   and your partner says,
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.580]   "Oh, I wonder how the Knicks are doing
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:08.420]   "this scoring season," or whatever.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.540]   If you get an unreciprocated "I love you" is a bad cue.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.820]   - Or some people are so tuned to this,
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:16.180]   if there's a half millisecond delay,
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.260]   they can detect delays in responses.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.820]   - Yes, yeah, delays in responses.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:25.180]   But even things like, so that's one set of cues,
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.420]   but then there's another set of interested mate poachers.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:32.300]   So if you're mated to someone who's desirable,
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.340]   which many people are, other people still desire them.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.660]   And so sometimes try to poach them
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.540]   or lure them away from you
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.100]   for a short-term sexual encounter
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.700]   or for a longer-term relationship.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.900]   And so we have to be,
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.180]   so jealousy motivates people to be attentive
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:51.780]   to potential mate poachers in their environment.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:56.700]   But even more subtle things like mate value discrepancies
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.340]   can trigger jealousy.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.260]   So even if there are no mate poachers
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.340]   and no cues to infidelity,
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:06.660]   if a mate value discrepancy opens up in a relationship,
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.460]   so in the American system,
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.660]   like you're a six or an eight or a 10,
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.780]   and people generally pair off
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.680]   based on similarity and mate value.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.740]   - So that tends to happen.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.300]   - Sixes end up with sixes, sevens end up with sixes,
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.300]   plus or minus one.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.660]   - Yeah, yeah, so yeah.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.300]   - These are somewhat subjective scare.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.580]   - Okay, it's somewhat subjective,
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.420]   but there's still some consensus about these things.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:32.180]   So even colloquially, people say things like,
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.500]   he's not good enough for you.
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.420]   Or I think you could do better to people
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.500]   and implicitly have a notion of relative mate value
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.180]   and discrepancies therein.
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.700]   Okay, but discrepancies can open up
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.780]   where none previously existed.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:51.540]   So you get fired from a job, all of a sudden,
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.820]   and most people are very understanding and forgiving
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.460]   about that if it's not too long.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.220]   But you go six months, eight months,
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.940]   people start having problems.
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.900]   Or someone's career takes off.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.820]   Let's say a woman becomes a famous singer
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.820]   or actress or a man does, career takes off.
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:13.220]   All of a sudden, there's a mate value discrepancy
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.340]   where you have access to a larger pool of potential mates
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.540]   and higher mate value potential mates.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:22.180]   So people are attentive to mate value discrepancies.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.660]   And so jealousy can get activated,
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.700]   even if there are no immediate threats to a relationship,
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.980]   but that the mate value discrepancy is a threat
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.820]   that looms on the horizon of the relationship
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.780]   because we know statistically the higher mate value person
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.300]   is more likely to have an affair
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.220]   and is more likely to dump the other person
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.100]   and trade up in the mating market.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.380]   - And when people find new partners
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:52.900]   for long-term relationships, do they tend to trade up?
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.180]   - On average, yes, if the discrepancy
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.340]   is sufficiently large.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.020]   So there are costs associated with breaking up,
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.660]   divorcing, for example.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:08.260]   I mean, it's emotionally, financially, it's a costly thing.
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.660]   And so if you have like a half a point mate value discrepancy
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.140]   you're not gonna see a lot of breakups,
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.300]   but if you have larger mate value discrepancies
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:20.300]   that's gonna augur more for trading up
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.340]   in the mating market.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:27.860]   So then you get into, so what jealousy is,
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:31.700]   it's an emotion that gets activated by these circumstances.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.300]   And then what people do about it
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.020]   depends on what their options are.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:40.380]   And people do things that in my published scientific work
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.540]   I say range from vigilance to violence.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.380]   So there's a whole spectrum of things.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.060]   In fact, I've identified 19 different tactics
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:53.060]   that people use to deal with problems once they get jealous.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:56.300]   And one is increased vigilance and the other is-
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.100]   - Vigilance for the behavior of the mate.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.860]   - Yeah, vigilance for the behavior of the mate.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.180]   And that can include stalking, following,
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.060]   hacking into iPhones or computers,
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:13.660]   monitoring the behavior of mate poachers,
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:18.140]   looking at eye contact between other men and your partner.
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.380]   There's a whole suite of things
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:22.660]   that is involved in vigilance.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.580]   And then at the other extreme,
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.140]   and we can talk about things in between,
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.260]   but the other extreme is violence.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.660]   And so in my new book, "When Men Behave Badly"
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.580]   I have a whole chapter on intimate partner violence.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.700]   And this is what I argue, and this is really unfortunate
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:44.700]   and I'm not endorsing, it's illegal, it's bad, don't do it,
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.980]   but people engage in intimate partner violence.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.700]   In America, something like 28 to 30% of all people
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.340]   who are married will experience intimate partner violence
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.300]   in their relationship.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.260]   So it's not a trivial percentage.
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.220]   - And that violence is between the two partners.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.540]   - Between the two partners, yes.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.180]   There's also violence that gets directed
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.620]   to our potential mate poachers,
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.060]   but that's a somewhat separate issue.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:15.060]   But one of the things that is functional about the violence
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:18.660]   is that it tends to reduce perceived
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.780]   mate value discrepancies.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.420]   So in other words, let's say guys tend to engage
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.060]   in the violence more than women do,
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.940]   although some argue that there's more equality
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:31.940]   in the violence, but at a minimum,
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:35.060]   men tend to do more damage when they do the violence.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.420]   - And when you're talking about violence,
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.940]   is this ever emotional violence?
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.780]   I mean-- - Yeah, there's that as well.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.940]   And in fact, the two tend to be correlated.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.240]   So in my studies of married couples,
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.260]   verbal violence is a good predictor
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.220]   of physical violence happening as well.
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:54.320]   So one thing that'll happen just to give a concrete example,
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.420]   guys will start insulting their partner's appearance.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.220]   You're really looking ugly today.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:04.220]   Your thighs are heavy, you're not looking very good.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.540]   So they try to denigrate the woman's appearance,
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.940]   which is a key component of woman's mate value.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.020]   - So they're trying to adjust more closely
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.020]   the mate value discrepancy.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.500]   - Yeah, they're trying to reduce
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.460]   her perceived, self-perceived mate value.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.660]   So if let's say he's a six, she's an eight,
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.520]   and he can convince her that she's actually only a six,
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:28.380]   then she's gonna be more likely to stay with him.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:29.420]   - Very diabolical.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.180]   - It's terribly diabolical.
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:36.180]   But the fact is, women don't feel good about themselves
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.700]   when they get beaten up by their partner.
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:43.980]   In fact, in the cases where it leaves physical evidence,
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.580]   women wear sunglasses or hot turtlenecks
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:51.220]   or cover up the bruises, it literally does lower
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.700]   the mate value of the woman
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.580]   by injuring her physical appearance.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.020]   - And getting her to conceal herself, stay home.
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:58.860]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.700]   - Yeah, she's taking her out of the,
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.720]   literally reducing her visibility.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.420]   - Right, and that's actually one of the predictors
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.200]   of violence is if he starts doing things
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.820]   other than violence like cutting off her relationships
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.660]   with her friends and her family,
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.660]   trying to sequester her and prevent her
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:21.980]   from getting exposed to potential other partners.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.820]   And so it is very diabolical,
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.640]   but I think important to understand
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   the potential functionality of intimate partner violence.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.740]   - What about, sorry to interrupt again,
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.900]   but I'm just so curious.
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.540]   So oftentimes my audience will say, yeah,
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.940]   interrupt too often, but I wanna make sure
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.820]   that I don't miss an opportunity to ask you
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.260]   about the intimate partner violence in the other direction,
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:48.760]   female to male, where stereotypically speaking,
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.300]   the opportunity for physical violence is still there,
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.980]   but the idea in mind is that
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.780]   it would be more of a psychological nature.
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.020]   Although I think there is evidence
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.900]   that some women beat their husbands,
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:03.380]   but I'm guessing it's not as frequent or am I off?
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.800]   - Well, different studies.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.820]   So it depends on whether you just simply count up acts
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.860]   or whether you look at the damage that's done, okay?
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.200]   And as I mentioned, men tend to do more physical damage.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.900]   So there are shelters for battered women
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.380]   all over the country.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.260]   As far as I know, there's one for battered men.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.460]   Now it may be, and this is partly true,
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:28.160]   that men are more ashamed if they get beaten up
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.220]   by their partner or clocked with a frying pan
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.940]   and it's possible and there's evidence
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:36.340]   that police don't take it as seriously.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.420]   So there's one case that I report in my book
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.300]   where a guy called the police
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.600]   and his wife had clocked him with something
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.660]   and police shows up and he says,
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:51.820]   if she so much as broke a fingernail in this altercation,
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.580]   they'll charge you and not her.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:58.540]   And so there is a police bias,
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.700]   a potential police bias in this.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.660]   And so there may be under-reporting of women
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:08.540]   beating up men as a consequence, okay?
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.480]   But the motivations are often different.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:16.480]   So one is that male sexual jealousy will trigger him
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.980]   to attack his partner and then she will use
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:23.180]   physical violence to defend herself.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:26.580]   So she might pick up a frying pan
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:30.380]   or a weapon of some sort to defend herself.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.380]   And so the motivation is his sexual jealousy on his part,
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.860]   but self-defense on her part.
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:40.340]   And so that accounts for some unknown percentage
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:41.460]   of the cases.
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:44.740]   And in some cases, it is women who were outraged
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.880]   when they discover their partner's been having sex
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.180]   with someone else, an infidelity of a sexual, financial,
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.220]   or emotional nature.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.700]   And so there is some female to male violence
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.360]   that absolutely occurs.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:03.220]   But the reduction of a perceived mate value discrepancy
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:06.620]   is a key function from male perspective.
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.740]   Now, again, not that he thinks about this,
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:12.500]   he's just angry and wants to hurt her, okay?
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.300]   Okay, but here's one other thing
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.620]   that is really interesting.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.000]   And about the intimate partner violence,
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.100]   and that's the specificity of it depending on circumstances.
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.680]   And namely, when the woman gets pregnant,
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.120]   she's more vulnerable to physical violence.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.320]   And when the man suspects that he's not the father
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.820]   of that pregnancy, he's more likely to direct the violence
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.800]   toward blows to her abdomen, okay?
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.360]   That's specific.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.200]   And so in that case, the hypothesized function
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.800]   is to terminate the pregnancy by a rival male
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.340]   as opposed to deterring the woman
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.920]   from committing an infidelity
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.460]   or from leaving the relationship entirely.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.280]   So that's why one function of intimate partner violence
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.400]   is just sequestering the woman
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.300]   and keeping her all to himself.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.380]   So it's both to prevent infidelity
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.620]   and to prevent defection.
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:14.420]   - I have a friend who's wife told me
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:21.900]   that if he cheats, I'll kill him, that's what she said.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.500]   But it's actually just much easier
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:27.020]   to keep him very, very busy.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:29.760]   And that statement now leaps to mind
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.500]   because of what you're describing,
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.760]   that there are many tactics by which people
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.460]   can engage this effort to reduce the mate value discrepancy,
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.940]   not all of which are overtly violent,
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:45.660]   but all of which are designed to constrain their behavior.
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.500]   - Right, right, yeah, so these would fall
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.160]   under what I would call mate retention tactics,
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:56.460]   only one or two of which fall under the violence category.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.740]   Yeah, there are even within partner
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:04.040]   psychological manipulations about these things.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.740]   So there are psychological manipulations
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:10.740]   about perceived mate value, no one else would want you,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.420]   you're a loser, there's denigration of partner
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.420]   within the relationship, even feigning anger
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.500]   to make the partner feel guilty
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.620]   about say looking at someone else.
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:29.900]   So there's all kinds of internecine warfare
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.740]   that goes on within relationships
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.400]   to manipulate perceptions of these things.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.440]   This is, I'm creating a much too jaded view
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.340]   of romance and love, I think.
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:42.660]   - Oh, no, we will get to the happy endings and long,
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.500]   I mean, there are certainly
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.460]   many happy relationships out there.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.260]   As a neuroscientist, I hear about this
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   and the immediacy of how people fall into a pattern
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:58.500]   of jealousy or a pattern of cheating and not always,
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.700]   but, and it just speaks to brain circuitry
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.540]   that's evolved to protect something.
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.900]   And I'm sure this statement is not exhaustive,
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.040]   but I think it's accurate to say that every species,
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:13.240]   but especially humans, wants to make more of itself
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.540]   and protect its young, but these issues of paternity
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.080]   and resource allocation, I mean, I think they're vital.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.900]   And I look forward to a day where evolutionary psychology
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:24.180]   and neuroscience can merge at the level
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:27.760]   of underlying mechanism, but I don't think it's dark,
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:31.100]   I think it's just the way we're wired at some level.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:36.180]   - Speaking of dark, could you tell us about the dark triad?
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.540]   - Yeah, so the dark triad,
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.580]   so we've been talking about sex differences on average,
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:44.340]   but there are critical within sex, individual differences.
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.700]   And the dark triad is one of the most important ones.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:51.820]   The dark triad consists of three personality characteristics.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:56.620]   So narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:00.980]   Homeworks of narcissism are things like grandiosity,
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:04.340]   person thinks that they're more intelligent,
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.340]   more attractive, more dazzling,
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.340]   more charming than they actually are.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.940]   I think they're the greatest persons in sliced bread.
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:13.380]   Importantly with narcissism,
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.620]   you also get a sense of entitlement.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.160]   So they feel entitled to a larger share of the pie,
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.060]   whether that be the financial pie, the status pie,
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.560]   or the sexual pie.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.340]   Machiavellianism is high scores tend to pursue
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.140]   an exploitative social strategy.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.260]   So they might feign cooperation,
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.600]   but then cheat on subsequent moves.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.020]   They view other people as pawns to be manipulated
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.100]   for their own instrumental gains.
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.540]   And then psychopathy, one of the hallmarks of psychopathy
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.280]   is a lack of empathy.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.180]   So most people have a normal empathy circuit
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.140]   where if a child falls down and gets hurt,
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:29:00.260]   we feel compassion for the harm that that person
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.420]   is undergoing.
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:04.900]   Or if a puppy gets hit by a car or whatever,
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:07.020]   we feel compassion.
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:09.580]   Psychopaths don't, that is those high on this,
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:13.180]   it's a dimensional thing, it's not a categorical thing.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.500]   So those high on psychopathy basically lack empathy.
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.540]   And so if you combine these qualities,
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.120]   narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism,
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.140]   you have some very bad dudes.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:31.880]   And I say bad dudes 'cause men tend to score higher
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.340]   in these things than women,
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:36.800]   especially on the psychopathy dimension.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.500]   So when you talk about clinical levels of psychopathy,
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:43.360]   it's estimated to be something like 1% of women
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.140]   and about 4% of men.
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:48.380]   So men are much higher on that.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.340]   So why is this important?
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.700]   Well, it's important in the mating context
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.360]   because those who are high on dark triad traits
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.120]   tend to be sexual deceivers for one.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.760]   So they're very often very charming,
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.200]   very good at seducing women and then abandoning them
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:11.620]   sometimes with after fleecing them
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.540]   or draining their bank account.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:19.080]   They're very good at the art of seduction.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:24.420]   They are also tend to be sexual harassers,
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.820]   serial sexual harassers, and sexual coercers.
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:34.040]   So when it comes to forms of sexual violence,
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.160]   high dark triad guys tend to be perpetrators of this.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.760]   And so like most men, I think would be,
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.780]   find it ethically abhorrent to sexually harass
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.660]   say a woman in the workplace,
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:50.740]   dark triad guys, in part, maybe they feel entitled to it.
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.700]   And in part, they do.
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.220]   I mean, in some cases that I report in the book,
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.920]   there are like literal descriptions
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.620]   where the guys are writing in these journals,
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.500]   oh, I knew she was attracted to me.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:05.720]   That's why she met me in the Xerox room
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.900]   just when I was there 'cause she wanted to admire
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.220]   my bulging biceps or whatever.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:11.220]   - It's all about them.
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.920]   - Yeah, and this gets into a bias that I talk about,
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.460]   which is the male sexual misperception bias,
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.020]   where a woman smiles at a man,
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.760]   man thinks, oh, she wants my body, she's attracted to me.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.500]   And women are thinking, oh, I'm just being friendly,
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.880]   I'm being polite or professional.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:33.540]   But these guys, high dark triad guys,
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:37.800]   are more susceptible to the sexual overperception bias.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.460]   And they literally believe that the woman
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.720]   is attracted to them and sending them signals,
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.860]   green lights, to sexually approach.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.400]   And so if you combine dark triad traits
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.940]   with the dispositional pursuit
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.860]   of a short-term mating strategy,
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.400]   that's an especially deadly combination.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.300]   That's when you get sexual harassment, sexual coercion.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:04.260]   So these are very bad dudes,
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.840]   also predictors of intimate partner violence.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:11.500]   - What approximate frequency in the male population
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.060]   have all three of the dark triad traits?
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.660]   And I realize that they're on a continuum,
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.020]   sociopathy, narcissism.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.060]   - That's why you can't say it,
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.260]   'cause they are on a continuum,
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:23.200]   and it's sort of arbitrary where you draw the line.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.340]   But I think it's a minority of men,
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:30.260]   it's a subset of men who commit the vast majority
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.220]   of these acts of sexual violence.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.880]   And that's why it's not like,
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.980]   if you look at victims of sexual violence,
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.420]   they're more numerous than the perpetrators
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.500]   of sexual violence, because the perpetrators
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.620]   tend to be serial offenders, so to speak.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:49.460]   One guy in the workplace harassing 15 different women,
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:53.100]   one guy sexually coercing multiple women.
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:56.540]   So that's why you have, in well-known cases in the news,
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:33:01.540]   like Harvey Weinstein, probably over 100 different women.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.820]   Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein,
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:06.060]   some of these more famous cases,
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.820]   these are a large number of victims,
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:13.820]   but pretty much sole perpetrators.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.180]   And there's no question that these guys,
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:19.640]   like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.380]   were definitely high on dark triad traits.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:26.420]   - You mentioned stalking briefly.
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:32.180]   Maybe we could just talk about some of the
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.380]   less known features about stalking.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.460]   I think I once heard you give a lecture
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:39.580]   where you said that one of the scariest things
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.680]   about stalking is that sometimes it works.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.740]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:48.300]   So, well, stalking has multiple motivations,
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.180]   but one of the most frequent motivations
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:56.180]   is a mating motivation, where either there's a breakup
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:00.180]   and the woman dumps the guy
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:02.580]   and the guy doesn't want to get dumped,
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.960]   he wants to maintain a relationship with her.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.100]   And I should say that when it comes to criminal stalking,
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.420]   there's a huge sex difference.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:13.320]   About 80% of the stalkers tend to be men, about 20% women.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.460]   So there are women stalkers,
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:20.460]   but they're about a fourth the number compared to men.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:25.260]   So the motivation of the guys
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:29.060]   tends to be either an attempt to get back together
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:34.000]   with the woman, either sexually or in a relationship,
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.000]   or and/or to interfere with her future mating prospects.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.900]   And it works in some of the time in two senses.
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:48.400]   One is it does interfere with her attempts to remade.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.100]   So in fact, it scares off some guys.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.620]   So like you show up and pick up a woman at her apartment
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:35:00.080]   for a date and her ex is sitting out there glaring at you.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.740]   - Or, and I'm actually familiar with the circumstance
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.400]   where early in a relationship,
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.900]   somebody mentions that an ex has made veiled threats
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:12.360]   about surveillance, for instance.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.340]   I've actually had that happen several times
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:16.780]   in my dating history where someone would say,
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.020]   you started opening up about previous relationships
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.580]   a little bit as it's appropriate.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:24.340]   And someone says, yeah, he mentioned that he was going to
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.340]   send someone around to surveil me, that kind of thing,
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:33.660]   which is a very interesting factoid to pick up.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.240]   But I heard it enough times,
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.900]   and people I know have reported hearing this enough times
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.340]   that I'm guessing that that's probably more frequent
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.200]   than people actually trailing people in cars
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.220]   and things of that sort.
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.300]   But planting that, it's like the psychological
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.620]   sea of surveillance is a form of harassment in some sense.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.620]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:54.460]   I think that you're right.
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:57.580]   I mean, there's that planting the psychological seeds,
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.960]   but then also with surveillance,
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.740]   some surveyors remain hidden, so you don't know necessarily.
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:06.380]   - Yeah, I confess in this case,
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:07.760]   it did not act as a deterrent
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:11.640]   for continuing the relationship, but that's another story.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.640]   So how often do women respond,
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.280]   I have to put this in quotes,
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.320]   for those that are listening, air quotes, end quotes,
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.400]   positively to stalking.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.080]   I mean, how often does it work to re-secure the partner
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.400]   after they've been broken up?
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.180]   - So in our studies, it's a minority of cases
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:34.300]   that it works to re-establish.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:37.500]   I think something like 15% of the time
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:41.580]   that it works either to temporarily re-establish
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:44.880]   a sexual relationship or lure the woman back in
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.860]   for a more permanent relationship.
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.140]   So most of the time it doesn't work.
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:54.140]   But one woman in our study said the guy,
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:57.100]   every time she went out with another guy,
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.120]   he would threaten the other guy.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.340]   And she said after about six months,
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.360]   there were no other guys.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.620]   He'd basically scared off all the other guys.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.060]   And so she went back to him
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.580]   because there were no other guys around.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:10.300]   - Yeah, I experienced this when I was in college.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.220]   I lived in a small town, very population dense,
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.260]   Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:19.580]   And there was a couple where every time
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:20.580]   this woman would date someone,
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:23.700]   he'd basically beat up whoever the new suitor was.
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:25.120]   And pretty soon no one would go near them.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.440]   They got a reputation as the kind of Sid and Nancy couple.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.220]   And indeed it worked.
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.840]   It worked in the sense that no one dare go near her
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.320]   and they ended up together.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.340]   So I've seen real life examples of this.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:39.660]   - Yeah, so it happens.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.460]   But it is in general, not a successful strategy.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.860]   - Oh no, and it's not what I'm suggesting.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.380]   I was just shocked to learn that,
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:50.280]   'cause we hear stalking and we have this,
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:52.020]   there's one very extreme image of it.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.680]   But the underlying motivations I think
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.660]   are reveal something about mating dynamics.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:00.160]   - Yeah, and I think that the circumstances
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.500]   are often a mate value discrepancy
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:06.420]   where the guy realizes correctly
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:09.220]   that he will be unable to replace her
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.980]   with a mate of equivalent mate value.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:15.660]   Or in some cases, any mate.
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.120]   You know, it's like, well, she was with me once,
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.260]   maybe I can get her back with me again.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.740]   So the psychology is very understandable,
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:29.200]   but it tends not to work.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.740]   Because the other thing we found,
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:34.240]   we did a study of 2,500 victims of stalking.
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.760]   This is with Josh Duntley, a former student of mine
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.220]   who's now a professor in a criminology department.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:43.220]   And what we found is there were large differences
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.560]   between the stalker and the victim of the stalker
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.140]   where the stalker tends to be much lower in mate value
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:52.980]   than the victim.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.700]   And so basically it's typically the woman
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:39:00.140]   who realizes she can do a lot better on the mating market.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:04.940]   And the guy realizes I am never gonna be able to replace her
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:07.340]   with a woman of equivalent mate value.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.260]   And so I'm gonna use this last ditch desperate measure
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:12.820]   to try to get her back.
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:14.360]   And occasionally it works.
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:20.160]   - I'm thinking more about this mate value thing.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:25.540]   This number, this metric, the eight, 10, six,
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.440]   whatever it is, and mate value discrepancy
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.300]   playing such a strong role in all these dynamics.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.780]   I should have asked this earlier,
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:38.260]   but what is the impact on mate value,
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:43.260]   perceived or real, of a woman having already had children?
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:49.180]   For instance, friends of mine who are married and divorced
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.500]   who have children will often post pictures of themselves
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.840]   with their children in their online profiles
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:57.820]   because it shows a strong sense of paternal instinct.
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:59.480]   There's the puppy thing,
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:05.580]   people with dogs or puppies demonstrating a capacity to care
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.900]   and for caretaking.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.820]   In women, the opposite is also true.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.460]   Women with children show capacity.
[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:14.620]   It demonstrates fertility, at least at one point,
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.340]   perhaps still fertility that's still present.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.200]   Does it positively, negatively, or neutrally impact
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.680]   a woman to already have children when seeking another mate,
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.240]   regardless of whether or not she was married
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.740]   or had the children out of wedlock?
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.220]   - Yeah, as a general rule, it decreases her mate value
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.720]   because kids with another mate are viewed as a cost,
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.980]   not a benefit.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:41.080]   And they're a cost on multiple dimensions,
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:44.620]   one of which they're gonna be a cost to the guy
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.580]   because he's gonna have to invest resources, time,
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:52.480]   attention, so forth, but also a portion of her effort
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.920]   and resources are gonna be devoted toward kids
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.840]   who are not genetically related to him,
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:59.280]   and which is one reason why stepfamilies,
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.000]   there's often a lot of conflict within stepfamilies,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.620]   very explicable from an evolutionary perspective.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:08.040]   So in general, it's a cost, not a benefit.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.600]   Sometimes it can be a benefit though.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:12.840]   So I know one case where a woman got divorced,
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.940]   she had two kids and she ended up successfully mating
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.020]   with a guy who was also divorced
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.300]   and had primary custody of his two kids.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.440]   And so there was a compatibility there.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.480]   But as a general rule, it will decrease a woman's
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.020]   and a man's mate value to have kids,
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:32.920]   especially kids who are young and financially dependent.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.320]   But what happens is let's say the woman would be an eight
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:42.320]   without kids, a guy who's a six might be able to attract her
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:48.320]   and might feel lucky to attract her
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.340]   because there's no way he would have been able
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.140]   to attract her under other conditions.
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:57.140]   But that's why the display of effort investing in her kids
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:59.180]   is often a mating tactic.
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:02.140]   He's showing, okay, I'm willing to invest in kids.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.860]   I'm willing to sacrifice.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:07.740]   And so they, in essence, become equivalent in mate value
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.460]   as a result of that.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.460]   But will she be able to attract on average other eights?
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:18.360]   Less likely, but the same is true of guys.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.240]   And this is why the reason that it affects women
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:27.000]   more than men is 'cause more custody tends to go with women.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.600]   That is the kids, women tend to have greater custody
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.060]   and women tend to invest more in the kids
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.920]   throughout their lives.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.120]   Now there are other things like alimony
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.900]   and child support payments and so forth.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.700]   But all the women I've talked to,
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:45.800]   I've talked to one-on-one with many women about this,
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.080]   they view a guy with kids as a cost, not a benefit,
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.780]   unless the kids are old enough and they've left home
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:55.640]   and are no longer financially dependent.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.560]   - And everything you just described is consistent
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.620]   with what you said earlier,
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.960]   which is that with subsequent marriages
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.920]   or as men get older, the tendency is to seek mates
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.920]   that are progressively younger, right?
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.420]   Because there's a higher, lower probability
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.200]   they'll already have children if they're much younger.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:17.420]   - Right, right, and if the guy is successful,
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:21.100]   if he has status and resources and has other qualities
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.680]   associated with higher mate value,
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:26.240]   then he will remain attractive to younger women.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.760]   - I realize it's not your specific area of expertise,
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:31.000]   but these days there's a lot of discussion
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.480]   about how early childhood attachment to parents
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.440]   influences mate choice later on.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.400]   This kind of general categorization of avoidant and anxious
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:44.560]   and anxious avoidant and all this kind of thing.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.160]   And again, putting my hat on as a neuroscientist,
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.520]   I think it makes sense that the neural circuits
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:56.520]   for attachment in childhood would be somehow partially
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.540]   or in whole repurposed for other forms of attachment.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.840]   We don't just tend to say, okay, that brain circuitry
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.760]   was from when I was a kid and now I'm an adult
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:05.760]   and so I'll develop this new attachment circuitry.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.860]   I'm guessing it evolves and whatnot.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:12.860]   But is there anything interesting about that,
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:15.840]   about childhood attachment strategies
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.120]   vis-a-vis stability of long-term partner choice,
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.040]   or is that too big of a leap for us to make here?
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.960]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I can offer
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.560]   some sort of informed speculation about it.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.440]   And as you point out, it's not my area of expertise,
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.000]   but I know a little bit about it.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.960]   And I mean, I think that a secure attachment style,
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.040]   if both partners have a secure attachment style,
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.120]   that's conducive to a long-term mateship.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.040]   Avoidant attachment styles,
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.120]   avoidant people tend to have more difficulty with intimacy
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.660]   and also higher probability of infidelity.
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:57.320]   And anxious attachment style, I don't know,
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.480]   can create problems of its own.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.680]   You know, in the overly clingy, dependent,
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:06.120]   you know, absorbing what I call high relationship load.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.480]   So, you know, there's like mutation load,
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.440]   which we all have a certain number of mutations.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:14.520]   There's, you know, parasite load.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.560]   There's also what I call relationship load.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.700]   So what is the baggage that someone brings
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.800]   to the relationship?
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.240]   - Probably correlated with the frequency of demand
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.360]   of immediate text message responses.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.200]   - Right.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.440]   - Well, I think that the frequency of demand,
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:29.580]   like the latent, the expected low latency
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:31.920]   of text message responses,
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.620]   plays out consistently in relationships.
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:35.460]   You know, early on,
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:37.080]   there's a very low expectation of response.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.320]   And then as people get attached,
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.880]   depending on their level of anxiety,
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.880]   if they don't hear back from somebody really quickly,
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:46.040]   where the mind goes is a very interesting aspect.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.920]   You know, do you become suspicious?
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.740]   Do you become anxious?
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.200]   Can you stabilize your own internal milieu?
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.880]   Or do you need to see the dot dot dot that's coming back?
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.140]   I'd love to see a study on that at some point.
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:57.980]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:58.800]   No, that's a good one.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.000]   And my intuition suggests that your prediction
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.960]   about that would pan out.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:06.920]   It would be the insecure that would really be,
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.420]   you know, getting upset if there were not
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:11.520]   that immediate response to the text.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.580]   - Yeah, I have a friend, a female friend,
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:17.240]   who deliberately, quote unquote, using her language,
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.840]   trains her potential partners to be comfortable
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.040]   with a variable response latency.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.080]   But then I asked her if she's comfortable
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:27.440]   with a variable response latency,
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.360]   and she said, "Absolutely not."
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:32.940]   So there's an asymmetry, at least in that case.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.080]   This is almost certainly a more rare circumstance,
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.000]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.400]   about unconventional relationships.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:45.560]   These days, I don't think it's just
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.640]   by virtue of living in California.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.280]   You hear more and more about monogamish,
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.720]   as opposed to monogamous,
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:56.280]   and various forms of polyamory
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.960]   that may or may not include the amory part.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:02.480]   You know, passes and permission
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:08.040]   based on seasons, circumstance, and prior infidelities.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.540]   Like, okay, somebody had a mishap early on.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:15.120]   You know, you have one pass, so to speak.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.320]   And you hear this kind of language getting thrown around.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.400]   And it's intriguing to me because it seems like
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.040]   an effort to bypass some of the more,
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.800]   if you will, hardwired,
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:30.000]   or at least culturally hardwired aspects
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.200]   of mate choice and sexual partner choice.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.760]   You know, acknowledging jealousy,
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.880]   but confronting it by allowing your partner
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.320]   to be with somebody else, for instance.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:40.640]   I confess I have friends
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.040]   who have unconventional relationships.
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.560]   I have friends with conventional relationships.
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.000]   Any thoughts on polyamory?
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.480]   - Yeah, yeah, I do have a couple of thoughts on it.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.080]   I haven't studied it extensively,
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:56.920]   but I think that the way I would phrase it is
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:01.920]   that there's an attempt to overcome
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.080]   certain evolved features of our mating psychology,
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:10.480]   but often in the service of other aspects
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.680]   of our mating psychology.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.040]   So what I mean by that is this.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.180]   So talk about polyamory.
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:18.760]   First of all, there's a sex difference on average.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.720]   That is, men are more likely to want to initiate
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:24.080]   a polyamorous relationship than women.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.280]   There are lots of exceptions,
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.520]   and I actually know of at least one exception personally,
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.240]   friends of mine who are in a polyamorous relationship.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.600]   But the motivation for men
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:38.840]   is that evolved desire for sexual variety.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.840]   So it gives him access to a wider variety of sex partners,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.920]   which is part of our evolved sexual psychology,
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.800]   especially for men.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.920]   Women, one motivation,
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:53.540]   now women also have a desire for sexual variety,
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:56.840]   on average tends not to be as great as that of men,
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.380]   but also have it.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:02.560]   But some women agree to a polyamorous relationship
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.560]   as a mate retention tactic.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.240]   That is, this guy, in order to keep him,
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.120]   she has to agree to the relationship.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.000]   And so the motivations for engaging in polyamory
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.360]   are somewhat sex differentiated.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.200]   - On average.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:19.520]   - On average, on average, there's lots of exceptions.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.440]   So now when it comes to sexual jealousy,
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.320]   there is this recognition that there,
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.280]   and the way that I would frame it,
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.960]   there's this evolved emotion,
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:30.760]   where it triggers sexual jealousy,
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:32.440]   seeing your partner having sex,
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.300]   or imagining your partner having sex,
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:37.040]   or falling in love with someone else.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.840]   But interestingly, and there haven't been studies on this,
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.280]   but I know of this one polyamorous couple
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.840]   where they reported to me,
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.560]   both of them reported to me,
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.120]   she said it doesn't bother her at all
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.160]   if her husband, they're married,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.680]   has sex with other women.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:54.520]   They allow it.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.300]   I think it's like every Thursday night or whatever,
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:58.920]   they have the different couples have different rules.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.800]   But one time she saw him walking down the street
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.480]   hand in hand affectionately with a former girlfriend,
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.840]   and she got extremely jealous,
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.320]   because it signaled an emotional connection.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.240]   So the sexual didn't bother her, the emotional did.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.560]   She happens to be bisexual,
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.560]   and she and her partner said that it really upset him
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.880]   when she slept with other men,
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.520]   but it was fine if she slept with other women.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.080]   - I think that's a fairly common thing
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.920]   that among the men that I know
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.520]   that are in polyamorous relationships,
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.080]   that that's a fairly common statement.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.880]   - Yeah, and so he kept trying to,
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:38.260]   in these internecine manipulations,
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.560]   trying to encourage her to sleep with other women,
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.440]   but not with men, and in her case,
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.760]   encouraging him not to get emotionally involved
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.340]   with other women, but the sex was okay.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:51.960]   So I think that, you know,
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.940]   I think that in the modern environment,
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.580]   you know, we have a very rich
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:58.600]   and complicated evolved mating psychology,
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:02.040]   and what we're doing in these novel forms,
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.800]   or semi-novel, 'cause these things
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.620]   have a pretty deep history themselves,
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.960]   that we're attempting to maximize
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:16.680]   some of our evolved desires while keeping quiescent
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:19.580]   other evolved aspects of our sexual psychology,
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:24.040]   like jealousy, so satisfying our desire for sexual variety,
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.000]   but keeping jealousy at bay,
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.600]   and different couples do it in different ways,
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.720]   so as you alluded to.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:32.920]   So I know one couple where, live in Los Angeles,
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.760]   and the woman from the woman said
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.100]   she gives her husband permission to have an affair,
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:39.960]   sleep with other women, as long as it's outside
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:42.200]   of the city limits of L.A., you know,
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.640]   and this other couple, it has to be Thursday night,
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:47.360]   you know, and so different, people have different--
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.880]   - So there are constraints on,
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.120]   but the constraints are specific
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.480]   and somewhat arbitrary to the relationship.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.840]   - Yeah, yeah, they're specific,
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.120]   and often in polyamorous relationships,
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.720]   people talk it out and come to an agreement
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:05.560]   on what is acceptable and what's out of bounds.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.280]   So, but in a way, I mean, in a way, it's just,
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:13.540]   you know, we can't change our evolved sexual psychology,
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:14.540]   I don't think.
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:17.820]   What we can do is we can activate certain elements of it
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:22.780]   and keep others quiescent, and that's all good.
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:25.660]   In a way, we do in the modern environment,
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:30.220]   so even to take it outside of polyamory, pornography, okay?
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:34.780]   Widely consumed internet pornography, what does that do?
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:36.220]   Well, there's a big sex difference there.
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:39.000]   Men tend to consume it a lot more than women.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.020]   The forms of the pornography are different,
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:44.840]   but in a way, the pornography, what it does is it
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.020]   parasitize men's evolved desire for sexual variety
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:52.180]   so they can, in some sense,
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:55.080]   psychologically experience sexual,
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.580]   a variety of different women sexually
[01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:59.160]   without actually doing it
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.260]   by just looking at their computer screen.
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:04.680]   And so in a way, another way of phrasing that
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:09.680]   is that we create modern, novel, cultural inventions
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:14.300]   in ways that satisfy our evolved desires
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.480]   and our evolved sexual desires.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.540]   - Yeah, it's interesting with the kind of explosion
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:20.660]   of online pornography.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.940]   I have a colleague at Stanford in psychiatry, Anna Lemke,
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:25.300]   who studies the dopamine system,
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.700]   and she mentioned two things of interest.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.140]   One is that not only is there a tremendous variety
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:34.340]   of experiences that are available to people to view
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:37.720]   in pornography, but the intensity is also quite high,
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:41.420]   so much so that at least for young people
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:44.840]   who are observing a lot of pornography, it's possible,
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:46.400]   and there are studies looking at this now,
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.060]   that their brain circuits become wired
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:50.740]   to observing sexual acts as opposed to being engaged
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.520]   in them, which can be extremely problematic.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:56.580]   So it's a sharp blade, so to speak.
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.860]   This pornography thing isn't what it once was,
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.520]   and it's evolving quickly.
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.380]   - Very interesting.
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:08.880]   So how should one frame all this?
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.940]   So I imagine a number of people listening
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.560]   are in relationships or would hope to be in a relationship.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.200]   In terms of understanding what we are selecting
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.340]   for consciously or subconsciously,
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.460]   it seems like there are common themes.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:27.260]   People want to feel attractive and attracted.
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:31.620]   People want to make sure that there's stability
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:33.760]   of the relationship, so when we hear about security,
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:36.460]   oftentimes I think of this kind of warm oxytocin,
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:41.220]   serotonin-like thing, but this mate value thing
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:44.780]   seems so powerful in all this, assessing mate value.
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:49.780]   So how objective are people about assessing their own value
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:54.920]   in terms of finding, securing, and over time,
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.060]   maintaining a relationship?
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:59.400]   Securing is dynamic because people age at different rates.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:05.900]   Is there an objective metric of this stuff?
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:09.020]   I guess you get a lot of statistics about somebody's image
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.560]   and you come up with an average value
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.100]   based on the population.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.060]   But how should people assess themselves?
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.040]   Because it seems like one of the features
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:21.260]   that would be very powerful for leading to happiness,
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.980]   of good partner selection that's stable,
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:27.860]   where one doesn't have to resort to these Machiavellian
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:30.780]   or diabolical or any of these other strategies,
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:34.060]   would be to be very honest with oneself.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.100]   And how does one do that?
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:38.340]   - Yeah, great questions.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:42.620]   And I don't think that the science has all the answers.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.820]   So a couple of things.
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:48.980]   So one is that I think people are generally pretty good
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:51.180]   at self-assessing mate value.
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:56.460]   And even self-esteem has been hypothesized
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:59.740]   to be one internal monitoring device
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:01.500]   that tracks mate value.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.160]   So when we get a promotion at work
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:04.300]   or we get a rise in status,
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.860]   we feel an elevated sense of self-esteem.
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:09.020]   We get fired, we get rejected,
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:12.180]   we get ostracized, our self-esteem plummets.
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:15.440]   So our self-evaluation, I think,
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.100]   does track mate value to some extent.
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.240]   There are people who overestimate their mate value,
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.740]   people high on narcissism in particular,
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.980]   and some people underestimate their mate value.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:31.220]   Another important element
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:34.860]   is that there's consensual mate value.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.820]   So that is, if you asked a group of 100 people,
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:40.260]   there's a fair amount of consensus
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:42.860]   that this person's an eight, that person's a six.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:46.160]   But there are also individual differences in mate value.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.900]   So one example is I know a woman who's a professor
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:54.140]   and she places a high premium on guys
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:57.420]   who are deeply steeped in Russian literature,
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:00.540]   which she is, so that she can have in-depth conversations
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:01.780]   about Russian literature.
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:04.100]   - Note to young men, learn Russian literature.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.180]   - Well, but this is high
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:09.220]   and it's a dimension of mate value that's important for her,
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:12.140]   but probably not important for a lot of other people.
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:14.500]   And so, whereas other people, let's say,
[01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:19.500]   might be, let's say you're into football or some sport,
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:24.300]   then, and the other partner thinks sports are stupid,
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:27.980]   then that's someone who's also into sports
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:29.860]   is gonna be higher in mate value for you.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:31.820]   So there are these individual differences
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:34.100]   in components of mate value, which is good,
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:36.340]   'cause that means if everyone were going after
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.440]   the same people and there was total consensus on mate value,
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.300]   then there would be a lot of mate-less people
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:45.300]   and a lot of problems in the world
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.060]   and a lot of dissatisfied people.
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:51.340]   So both are important, the consensual aspects
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:56.340]   and the individually differentiated components of mate value.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:02.420]   But in terms of accuracy of assessment,
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:06.500]   it's, there are no good measures scientifically to do this
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.580]   because it's sufficiently complicated.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:13.380]   So I mentioned, we've mentioned maybe half,
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:16.780]   maybe a dozen different components of mate value,
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:19.760]   physical attractiveness, kindness, emotional stability,
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:24.760]   health status, et cetera, and these aren't the only ones.
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.620]   So I teach a course on psychology of human mating
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:30.780]   and I ask the people, it's a large course,
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:32.740]   couple hundred people, tell me,
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:34.780]   what do women want in a mate?
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:36.620]   And so I started with the blackboard.
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:39.060]   This is back in the old days when there was a blackboard,
[01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:40.420]   a piece of chalk, and they say,
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.140]   I want a mate who has a good sense of humor,
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:45.300]   sorry, sense of humor, intelligent, right, kind.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:49.020]   And so I go through this and I go through five blackboards
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:51.780]   and then I run out of space over what women want.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:54.320]   Now I do the same for men and men kind of run out of space
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.620]   after about a blackboard and a half.
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:59:00.280]   But what that tells me is that these qualities
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:02.960]   are large in number and complicated in nature.
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:06.780]   So you say, you want a guy who's nice and generous.
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:09.560]   They say, yeah, so like a guy who at the end of every month
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:13.120]   takes his whole paycheck and gives it to the wino,
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.080]   homeless person.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:17.440]   Well, no, not that generous, you know, generous toward me,
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.540]   but not toward everyone else.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.240]   Nice in general, but not so nice
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.880]   that they're getting exploited.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.500]   So, or even, you know, now there's something,
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.240]   you can't be too healthy.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:32.540]   So people, that's unidimensional, but you want a guy,
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:36.460]   women want a guy who's confident, but not too confident.
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.260]   You know, 'cause too confident will mean
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:40.040]   he's either arrogant, narcissistic,
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:43.320]   or not sufficiently manipulable.
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:47.720]   So anyway, so my point is that
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:50.880]   because there are so many different components of mate value
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:54.360]   and that they vary in amount,
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:57.160]   so it's not just listing the qualities and summing them up,
[01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:00.760]   they vary in amount, it's a very complicated endeavor
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.380]   to assess accurately.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:05.960]   But I think people have a good intuitive sense
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:08.160]   of people's relative mate value,
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.240]   especially if you're in a group
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:13.000]   and you've been able to interact with them for a long time.
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.500]   And one indication is, again, that attention structure,
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.880]   how many other people really want to mate with this person,
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.500]   that's a good cue that they're high in mate value.
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.120]   Nobody wants to mate with you,
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.520]   then cue that you're low in mate value.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.860]   - Reminds me of the time when one is trying to decide
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:32.900]   who to ask to the prom.
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:35.600]   You know, there's a complicated assessment
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:38.200]   based on who one would like to go with,
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.100]   whether or not you're already partnered,
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:41.540]   who would say yes, who would say no,
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.760]   because there's a risk in rejection too,
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.600]   because that, if I'm guessing correctly,
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.440]   could lower one's own perceived mate value.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:51.700]   - Yeah, it's getting rejected.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:53.520]   - Right, frequency of rejections
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:55.040]   probably doesn't lend itself well
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.560]   to increasing one's own view of their mate value.
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:01.620]   - Right, which is why many guys
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:04.700]   have what I call mating anxiety.
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:08.040]   That is, they don't approach them
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:10.420]   because they risk getting shot down.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.900]   They're trying to maintain that number
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:16.400]   by reducing the amount of data.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:18.900]   - Right. - Yeah, very interesting.
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:22.800]   - But it backfires in the modern environment.
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:25.600]   So there's a famous psychologist, Albert Ellis,
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.420]   who had mating anxiety, and he assigned himself
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:30.920]   the task of approaching, asking,
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.380]   like I can't remember what the number was,
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.840]   but let's say 50 women out on dates.
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.160]   He lived in New York City, so there were a lot of women.
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:39.200]   - He could just stand still and they would stream past.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.640]   - Yeah. - And he assigned himself,
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.040]   like ask 50 women on a date every week.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.340]   And he said, after two weeks,
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:47.800]   his mating anxiety disappeared.
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.920]   'Cause most of them said, buzz off, creep.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:53.560]   But he decided, well, he's actually getting rejected,
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:56.540]   didn't cause my world to collapse, and it actually was okay.
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:02:00.180]   And so he kind of inured himself to this rejection.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:04.000]   And so it ended up, he ended up doing quite well
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.080]   on his mating life.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.760]   - Another point for cognitive behavioral desensitization.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.680]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:10.480]   - He ran the experiment.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:11.880]   Just a couple more questions.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:15.820]   Earlier, you mentioned self-deception-based deception,
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.320]   or something of that sort.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.080]   Self-deception, that people aren't always trying
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.200]   to convince somebody else of something
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:24.760]   that secretly they know isn't true,
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.000]   but that they deceive themselves.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.020]   - Yeah, yes. - Could you embellish
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:28.860]   on that a little bit?
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:30.140]   - Yeah, so, well, this is actually,
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:33.640]   this hypothesis is the famous evolutionary biologist,
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.320]   Robert Trivers, first advanced this hypothesis
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:41.320]   in the preface in 1976 to Dawkins' book, "The Selfish Gene."
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.040]   And he's subsequently written more about it,
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:49.880]   both in a scientific article and in a more popular book.
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:53.000]   But the idea is that if, the core idea is that
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.760]   successful deception is facilitated by self-deception.
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:02.560]   So if you really believe that, and X,
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.760]   then you're gonna be a more successful salesman
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.680]   to convince other people of X.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:10.320]   So if you believe you're, let's say, a 10 and made value,
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:13.560]   you truly believe it, even if you're not,
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:16.580]   I'm gonna have a more successful time convincing you
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:17.800]   that I am as well.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.160]   And so the hypothesis is basically
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:24.440]   that people self-deceive in order to increase
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:27.520]   the effectiveness of actual deception, okay?
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:34.440]   But I think that there are people who are,
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.880]   so in one other dimension I'll mention too,
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:39.560]   is that animals often take each other
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.760]   at our own word for things.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:44.780]   So if we're self-confident, people assume
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.000]   that we must have the goods to back up that self-confidence.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.320]   If we're a quivering mass of insecurity,
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.260]   people believe, well, we don't have the goods
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:54.080]   to back up anything, you know?
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:58.160]   And so people use other people's displays
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:01.800]   of their self-confidence as a cue to their goods.
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:04.880]   And it's, in general, a pretty reliable cue,
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.600]   but then there are overestimates and underestimates
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.200]   as we've talked about, like with narcissism.
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.740]   - Yeah, we see this with the job candidates.
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.600]   You know, you are taught to look very carefully
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.500]   at the application and consider all aspects,
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.980]   but ultimately you consider that also in light of, you know,
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.300]   how firmly someone believes in the vision
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:27.600]   of what they're trying to bring to the profession.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.200]   And that's, I think, largely a subconscious process
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:33.500]   and that being aware of it can be helpful.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.680]   But yeah, when somebody is confident,
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:36.020]   you tend to think that they're going to get
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:37.560]   where they say they're going to go.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:42.120]   And it acts as a bit of a heuristic for not needing,
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.040]   the impulse is that one then doesn't need
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.220]   to go vet all the information quite as carefully.
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:47.800]   But if, I guess if one is aware of it,
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:51.160]   then you know to dig deeper in,
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:53.720]   because it seems like there's a lot of deception going on.
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:55.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:05:00.320]   Well, and, you know, and something we talked about earlier,
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.600]   people high on psychopathy are very good at deception.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.920]   I don't know whether they are good at self-deception
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:12.760]   or whether they're just really good deceivers, you know?
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:15.840]   So, but they can be very effective.
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:18.760]   And out in California, you know,
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.160]   you live out in California,
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:23.520]   I'm sure you've seen your fair share of cases like that.
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:27.280]   - Oh yeah, I think across today's discussion
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:32.280]   and various examples pop to mind of seeing these features
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:34.080]   in humans, it's so interesting.
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.600]   I find the work that you do incredibly interesting.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.600]   I think this field of evolutionary psychology
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:43.160]   is fascinating and I hope, I said it before,
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.000]   but I'll say it again.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000]   I feel like neuroscience and evolutionary psychology
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.280]   are nudging towards one another.
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:49.560]   And it's only a matter of time
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:53.200]   before they merge in some formal way.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.360]   I mean, there is the work, for instance,
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.880]   on polygamous versus monogamous,
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:57.960]   prairie voles and levels of vasopressin,
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.880]   but it's a big leap to go from vasopressin
[02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:03.040]   and a prairie vole, no disrespect to that beautiful work,
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:06.040]   but to humans and say, oh, vasopressin inhalants
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:08.280]   are going to make you monogamous or something.
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:10.480]   I think that's, I probably got the direction
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.160]   of the effect wrong, but you get the point.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.560]   - Yeah, yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.660]   And I think it will happen.
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:18.160]   I think it's starting to happen and it will happen
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:20.240]   because getting at the neuroscience
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:22.120]   is getting at the underlying mechanisms
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:23.820]   that are driving the process.
[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:27.520]   So, what an evolutionary perspective brings to bear
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:32.080]   is evolved function and ultimate explanation,
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:35.120]   the selective forces that created adaptations,
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.140]   the functions of those adaptations,
[02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:38.680]   and the neuroscience brings,
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:40.800]   well, what is the underlying machinery
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.980]   that these mechanisms are instantiated in?
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:46.240]   - Yeah, it would be wonderful to collaborate someday.
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:48.920]   Maybe we'll do a brain imaging study on jealousy
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:51.800]   or something in, I don't know, and throw it.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:52.940]   You're the psychologist.
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:56.440]   You would come up with a beautiful experimental design.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:58.000]   I'm certain that people are going
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.640]   to want to learn more about your work.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:00.920]   Certainly, we will give them links
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:03.500]   to your social media and other sites.
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.840]   You've written a tremendous number
[02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:06.320]   of really interesting books.
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:09.400]   Tell us about your most recent book
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:10.800]   and maybe some of the others that,
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:12.420]   if people are interested in these topics
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:15.120]   and they want to learn more, that they could explore.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.800]   - Sure, okay, so, well, my most recent book
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:21.280]   is called "When Men Behave Badly,
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:23.940]   The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:25.820]   Harassment, and Assault,"
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:29.100]   and that book deals with conflict between the sexes,
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:31.820]   sexual conflict, and so it deals with them
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:36.920]   both in what I call mating market conflicts,
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:38.600]   some of the topics we've been talking about,
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:41.960]   deception in internet dating and things like that.
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:46.040]   Second is conflict that occurs within mating relationships
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:48.200]   of the sort that we've been talking about as well,
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.580]   financial infidelity, emotional infidelity,
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:54.120]   sexual infidelity, coping with conflict
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:55.240]   within a relationship,
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:58.040]   and I actually have some suggestions for strategies
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:01.360]   for coping with conflict within a relationship.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:02.880]   Coping in the after,
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.120]   dealing with the aftermath of breakups.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:06.580]   So often there's an asymmetry.
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:08.960]   One person wants to break up, the other doesn't.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.840]   So I talk about coping in the aftermath,
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.960]   and then I also talk in this book,
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.160]   "When Men Behave Badly,"
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.320]   about some of the darker sides of human mating,
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:22.780]   like intimate partner violence, stalking,
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:25.520]   sexual harassment, sexual coercion.
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:26.880]   So that's what that book's about,
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.440]   and I think it's gotten well-reviewed
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:33.660]   and people find it very useful in understanding
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:37.180]   what is otherwise a lot of baffling phenomena.
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:39.880]   Why do men and women seem at odds with each other
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:41.140]   in so many domains?
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.600]   Why do some of these recurrent forms
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:45.700]   of sexual conflict occur?
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.780]   So that's what that book's about.
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:50.120]   My previous book, so my first book,
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:51.520]   which I've had the good fortune
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:54.080]   to be able to revise a couple of times,
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:57.440]   deals more broadly with human mating strategies.
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.380]   It's called "The Evolution of Desire,
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:01.320]   Strategies of Human Mating,"
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.260]   and gives people a broad overview
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:05.880]   of what people want in a mate,
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.560]   tactics of attraction, tactics of mate retention,
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:11.920]   and so forth throughout the whole mating process,
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:15.160]   serial mating, causes of divorce, and so forth.
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.200]   And then even more broadly,
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:21.540]   I have a textbook called "Evolutionary Psychology,
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:23.520]   The New Science of the Mind,"
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.780]   which is in its sixth edition right now,
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:29.140]   and it's the most widely used textbook
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:33.020]   in evolutionary psychology around North America and Europe,
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:36.840]   and actually, it's been translated even into Arabic
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.180]   and other countries.
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:41.100]   So that deals somewhat with mating,
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:45.380]   but also deals with survival problems or evolved fears
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:50.380]   and phobias, issues about kin and family,
[02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:54.500]   extended family, friendships, social hierarchies,
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:59.120]   status hierarchies, warfare, and other topics.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.580]   So "The Evolutionary Psychology" textbook
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:03.320]   is the broadest book,
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.860]   and then maybe the second broadest
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:09.320]   is "The Evolution of Desire, Strategies of Human Mating,"
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:12.680]   and then for those interested in "Conflict Between the Sexes,"
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:15.300]   the latest book, "When Men Behave Badly."
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:16.980]   - Fantastic.
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:19.100]   I love your work.
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:23.100]   I'm so grateful for the clarity and depth and rigor
[02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:25.980]   with which you do it, and you convey it to us.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:28.180]   I know I speak for many people,
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:29.680]   when I just want to say thank you.
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:32.620]   This is a tremendously informative conversation.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:33.460]   - Thank you.
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:35.000]   Well, it's been a delight to talk with you,
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.860]   and I hope we do engage in that research collaboration
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:41.420]   of merging neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:42.300]   - Let's do it.
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:43.140]   - All right.
[02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:43.960]   - Great, thank you, David.
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:44.800]   - Thank you.
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:46.540]   - Thank you for joining me for my conversation

[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:44.660]   In many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:46.420]   we discuss supplements.
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:48.660]   While supplements might not be for everybody,
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:51.080]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.900]   for things like sleep and focus
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:55.820]   and other aspects of human performance and daily life.
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:56.940]   One issue with supplements
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:59.620]   is that many of the supplement companies out there
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:02.220]   are subpar with respect to quality,
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:05.700]   and they are not precise about the specific amounts
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:08.900]   of the various supplement contents that they include.
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.700]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:13.220]   because Thorne supplements
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:15.740]   are known to have the highest levels of stringency
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.700]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients
[02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:20.060]   and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients.
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:21.820]   In other words, what's listed on the label
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:24.140]   is what's actually in the bottle.

[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:53.580]   and many other extremely interesting topics today.
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:55.340]   And last but not least,
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:57.140]   thank you for your interest in science.
