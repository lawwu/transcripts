[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.000]   - All right, next question is from Tanya.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I find my inner voice very cruel
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   and I struggle with negative thoughts.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.040]   Do you have any advice on how I can overcome these
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.440]   on a daily basis?
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.680]   - So Tanya, this is a very common thing.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680]   I'm gonna start with that.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.840]   I think this is misunderstood about mental health issues
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.800]   from people who don't suffer from them
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.480]   is how often the common source of the mental health issues
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.160]   is these inner voices.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   So psychologists will call this negative rumination.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.760]   It's a voice in your head that is constantly
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.040]   pointing out negative things.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.120]   So for anxiety, the negative ruminations
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.060]   are those looking to the future with concern.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.900]   What about this?
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.720]   What about that?
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.560]   What if this doesn't go well?
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.380]   What if this disaster happens?
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.120]   What if, you know, it's looking to the future
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.080]   and constantly pointing out things that it's worried about.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.120]   For depression, it's the same voice.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.280]   It's just often looking to the past.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.600]   Why did you do that?
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200]   Oh my God, that was the wrong thing to do.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.840]   You're so worthless.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.280]   People are thinking about that.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400]   I'm sure people are talking about it.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.200]   No one, look at that event.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.040]   That guy who snubbed you,
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.800]   yeah, it's because no one respects you.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.160]   So it's just looking back at your life so far
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.720]   like a, you know, upset movie critic
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.760]   just pointing out everything that went wrong.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.860]   That's why there's such a connection
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.340]   between anxiety and depression.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.180]   They go back and forth.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.560]   It's your ruminative voice
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.680]   and it's just kind of where it's aimed.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.500]   And once that voice has a really strong foothold
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.960]   in your head, it's got a real comfy chair
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.360]   and it knows that, oh, I'm gonna be listened to.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240]   Then it can change its, you know, themes,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.800]   but it's in there screwing around with your brain.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.240]   And that's why we often find
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.920]   those two particular mental health issues
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.320]   so tightly intertwined.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.760]   So it's a very common, well-understood issue.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.360]   I think of it a lot like knee pain.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.480]   You know, it's a, oh, I have this thing.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.300]   It's really common.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.140]   It's really annoying.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200]   I should do something about this
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.600]   because otherwise, it makes my life really hard right now
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840]   and my knee hurts, but also because it hurts.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.980]   It's making me walk differently
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.800]   and I might get like even bigger problems going forward.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.720]   Let's get it treated.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.680]   And that's the right way to think
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.000]   about overwhelming negative ruminations.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   Your knee's hurting you.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.120]   It's time to get it fixed.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.460]   There is a lot of good approaches to fixing rumination.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.920]   In particular, second wave and third wave psychotherapy
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.700]   are essentially focused like a laser
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.660]   on ruminations and how to dissipate it.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.740]   With first wave psychotherapy, which is talk therapy,
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.040]   the Freud influence therapy and analysis,
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.400]   this is what people think about from Woody Allen movies
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.720]   and is talking about your kids
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.480]   and your childhood and your life.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.940]   Second and third wave psychotherapy
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.160]   are much more evidence-based
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.360]   and it says we need to tackle ruminations.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.960]   So second wave psychotherapy
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.560]   is from understanding my history correctly,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.720]   and I hope I'm getting my terminology correct.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   Second wave psychotherapy is defined most notably
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.920]   by cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.400]   This is where you directly address ruminations
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.080]   and point out the distortions in the thinking.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.680]   You give names to the distortions.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.560]   You separate yourself from the rumination
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320]   and you try to diffuse their power.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.480]   Tanya, if you're looking for an introduction
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.720]   to second wave psychotherapy,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.980]   the proper book to look at is titled "Feeling Good."
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.560]   Big bestseller from either the 1970s or the 1980s
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.480]   that walks through all the principles
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.300]   of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.720]   Third wave psychotherapy is best defined
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.260]   by ACT, acceptance commitment therapy.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.820]   It's similar, again, it's rumination-based,
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.740]   but here it has more of an Eastern-motivated approach
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.000]   of noting all the negative ruminations,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.820]   not resisting them, but also not entertaining them,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.660]   and persisting with committing
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660]   to useful value-driven behavior regardless.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.100]   So it's a sort of diffusing of,
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.700]   it's just this thing that's,
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.060]   there's this voice and I have a name for it
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.700]   and I have a name for the character
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.480]   and he's just in there doing all this chatter
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.300]   and I sort of like, okay, I'm good to see you there,
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.020]   but I'm gonna go on and do this thing I think is important.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.500]   So you see like ACT, for example,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.380]   ACT is very effective for anxiety-related issues,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.060]   panic attacks, for example, where it's like,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.700]   well, yeah, bad things could happen,
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.180]   but this stuff matters, I'm just gonna go forward with it.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.640]   Cognitive behavioral therapy tends to be very good
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.820]   for more of a negative rumination
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.620]   on your sort of depressive ruminations.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.260]   So you can intervene, it's like, no, that's stupid.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.620]   Not everyone was embarrassed by me.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.740]   And the fact that that guy said this thing at the meeting
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.220]   doesn't mean that everyone thinks I'm dumb.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.180]   So CBT is very good for that backward-thinking rumination.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.860]   ACT is very good for forward-thinking rumination.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.580]   It's like, that stuff could happen, probably won't,
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.280]   but I'm gonna live my life and you get used to it.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.880]   So they have different approaches.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.860]   If you're looking for the good consumer public-facing book
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.780]   on third-wave psychotherapy, look at "The Happiness Trap,"
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.820]   which we talked about in a recent book as well.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.640]   So Tanya, buy those books first.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.780]   See which of these resonates more with you.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.140]   And I would read both of these books
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.700]   and see which of these resonates more
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.740]   with your particular brand of rumination.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.640]   It's possible that just the ideas in these books themselves,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.060]   you start doing the exercises
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.700]   and you immediately see improvement.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.420]   This happens with a lot of people.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.240]   If you're not seeing improvement immediately,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.180]   then you get a professional therapist involved.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.020]   What do they do?
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.660]   They're professionals that are administering
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.340]   these evidence-based ideas on minimizing rumination.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.900]   They're the brand equivalent of the knee doctor.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.220]   The reason why I'm suggesting you buy these books first
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.860]   is that when you're looking for a therapist,
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.140]   now you know what type you're looking for.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.560]   And so if you're dealing with negative ruminations
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.660]   on your past and CBT really resonates,
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.340]   then you're looking for a cognitive behavioral therapist.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.300]   If you're dealing with anxiety and forward-facing ruminations
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.140]   and the ideas from ACT are resonating,
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.380]   then you look for a therapist
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.580]   that says they're an ACT practitioner.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.500]   So now you can be kind of selective in who you're choosing.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.060]   One of our sponsors, for example, BetterHelp,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.380]   is an easy way to get involved in professional therapy
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.700]   that's cheaper and more flexible
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.040]   than trying to find someone who happens to be open nearby,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.740]   but maybe you also just know of someone nearby.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.580]   But this is what I would say.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.420]   Take this seriously.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.700]   What you're facing is incredibly common,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.300]   but you do want to get on top of it.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.140]   We have a lot of tools to get on top of it.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.860]   Learn the tools, and if needed,
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.520]   find a professional to help you administer them.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.760]   - All right, let's do another question, Jesse.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.880]   - Next question's from Mark.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.520]   I have a good routine in place for my deep work.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.680]   My desk is cleared from all documents,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.180]   same for my computer.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.240]   I set out exactly what I want out of the session
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.560]   and how long it should take.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.440]   I then do a deep, do a loop around the inside
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.520]   of the building twice, clearing my head
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.500]   while listening to binaural beats.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.660]   I then do two minutes of breathing exercises outside.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.360]   Then as soon as the door opens, it's showtime.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280]   My problem is shower work.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.600]   When I block off even to do specific shower work,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.080]   my mind wanders all the time,
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.400]   and I find it difficult to get things done.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.440]   Do you do anything ritual-wise before shower work?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.320]   - Well, first of all, I like this deep work ritual.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.160]   - Yeah.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.980]   - What do you have?
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.160]   Okay, let's summarize.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.140]   Clean desk, clean computer desktop,
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.260]   lay out a plan for the deep work session,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.680]   what I'm going to do and how long it's going to take,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   a loop around the inside of the building twice
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.480]   while listening to these, I don't know what this was either,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   binaural beats.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.440]   - I think you guys are from Huberman.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.120]   - Oh, okay, excellent.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.800]   So it's probably a specific,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   what's this, like a white noise type thing?
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.360]   - Yeah.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.400]   - Okay.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.680]   Two minutes of breathing exercise outside,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.080]   and then opens the door and goes into work.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.960]   Cool deep work ritual.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.720]   We talk about these all the time.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.480]   Deep work is unnatural,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.100]   and so we have to sort of trick our brain
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.120]   into wanting to do it.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   So having a really multimedia, multi-sensory,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.280]   highly repetitive ritual that comes right before deep work,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.760]   eventually your brain builds
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.960]   this automatic reflexive connection
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.260]   that you finish this ritual and it's ready to execute.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.160]   There's a good question.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.720]   Should we be doing something similar for shallow work?
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.960]   And I think it's a good question
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.880]   because I think we don't treat shallow work
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.680]   with enough respect,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.620]   at least from the standpoint of cognitive preparation.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.800]   Now, something we've been talking about
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.440]   more and more on this show
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.960]   is the cost of loading up a cognitive context
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.720]   and how this is difficult and takes time.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.880]   So like before you're doing deep work,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.000]   one of the reasons why these rituals are helpful,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.040]   like Mark just talked about,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.240]   is not just because it reflexively puts your mind
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.680]   into a deep work mode,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.080]   but you're clearing out,
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.200]   you're giving your brain time
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.240]   to clear out unrelated old cognitive context
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.120]   and load up the context of the work you're about to do.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.000]   Part of what's effective about this ritual then
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.080]   is that Mark reviews everything he's going to do
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.920]   at the beginning of the ritual,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.400]   initiating the loading of that context.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.600]   And this ritual takes enough time
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.440]   that he can start clearing out the context
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.840]   of whatever email or Zoom nonsense
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.160]   he was doing right before the deep work session.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.780]   And the ritual is all activities
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.340]   that aren't gonna trigger other types of context as well.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.520]   It's listening and walking
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.560]   and nothing that's related to work.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.960]   And so part of why this deep work ritual is effective
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.640]   is that he shows up loaded from a brain perspective
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.960]   to do exactly that work.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.680]   Now I think a shallow work often requires
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.840]   those contexts as well,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.660]   but we don't treat it with the same respect.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.960]   So it might seem like the most shallow thing in the planet
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.360]   that I'm gonna answer emails.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.280]   This isn't deep work.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.840]   I'm not writing the great American novel.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.960]   I'm answering emails.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.440]   But from a cognitive standpoint,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.480]   each of those emails has this complicated social,
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.560]   professional context that you need to fully load
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.240]   to figure out how to carefully word your response.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.080]   And if you just haphazardly just jump in
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.040]   and start typing emails,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.440]   your brain's like, I am not ready for this.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.520]   And then when you switch to another email
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.240]   from a client that's completely unrelated
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.080]   to what you were just doing,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.520]   your brain plays the comic break squealing sound,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.400]   like, wait a second, we're not ready to do this either.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.240]   And you feel that real resistance.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.920]   And I think that's what Mark is pointing out here.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.840]   It's because you don't have the right stuff loaded up.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.040]   You're trying to force information out of your brain
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.340]   that it's not ready to do.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.040]   And so this is a good time to declare
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.560]   that for certain types of shallow work,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.720]   yeah, let's ritualize some of that as well.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.740]   So for email, let's start with that example.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.680]   Let's take your email inbox,
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.100]   and I'm gonna give you a ritual right now.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.000]   Let's go through the single threading exercise
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.200]   we talked about earlier in the show.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.320]   Break up the emails
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.540]   into different cognitive context subject matters.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.380]   If you're using Gmail, you can label and archive them.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.820]   So they're all with a common label.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.420]   By the way, here's another hack on that.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.720]   You don't have to actually give content specific names
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.100]   to these labels, because there could be over time,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.040]   dozens and dozens of different relevant cognitive context.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.220]   Just label them context one, context two, context three,
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.120]   context four, context five, up to context 10.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.960]   Doesn't matter what the names are.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.460]   It's just you have some way of, okay,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.500]   oh, there's a bunch of emails about this very specific thing.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.940]   I'll call that context three.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.180]   So do that, right?
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.220]   So figure out like what are the different topics
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.080]   I have to answer in my inbox?
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.960]   Label them, put them together and get them all out of sight.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.100]   Now you can say, what am I gonna tackle first?
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.940]   Context one.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.540]   Now I'm gonna do the two laps in the building
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.540]   that I did before my deep work.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.100]   But now the point of these two laps is to begin loading up
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.300]   the relevant circuits for context one.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.140]   And just think in your head while you're walking,
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.540]   okay, these emails are all about a conference
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.500]   that's coming up.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.980]   Let's start thinking about the conference.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.820]   What's going on?
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.860]   Let me get that context loaded.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.580]   You sit down at your desk, load up just that context.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.420]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.260]   Answer those emails.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.220]   All right, what's context two?
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.980]   I'm up two laps around the building.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.020]   Switching to that context, starting to think through,
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.620]   okay, these are all emails about a project.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.780]   Where am I on the project?
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.220]   Well, you know, what do I really need to do here?
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.040]   You know what?
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.880]   We're really behind.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.580]   I think maybe we need to do a more drastic reset.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.020]   Start thinking about it as a way to get the context shifted.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.300]   Do a couple laps around the building.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.220]   Sit down, boom, email, email, email, email.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.160]   So why don't we do the same type of rituals
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.620]   around this particular shallow work task?
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.460]   I like that.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.220]   Let me give you another shallow work ritual
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.180]   'cause I'm on a roll now, Mark.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.900]   I like your idea.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.860]   I've got a Zoom meeting.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.020]   All right, well, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.740]   I'm gonna put that Zoom meeting on my calendar
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.020]   and I'm gonna put 20 minutes
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.220]   after that Zoom meeting on my calendar right after.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.020]   As soon as I put that meeting on my calendar,
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.680]   I extended that appointment by 20 minutes.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.300]   And so as soon as this meeting is over,
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   I'm gonna write down all my notes
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.620]   and I'm gonna just walk and think about that meeting.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.940]   Laps around the building, walk around the block.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.940]   All right, what just happened there?
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.220]   What do I really need to do next?
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.020]   You know, was that really a good idea?
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.540]   Are we missing some information?
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.820]   What are the right steps here?
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.180]   Actually, I should not do those steps
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.780]   and just talk to Paul and like,
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.860]   we probably need to just...
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.280]   This is gonna be a longer conversation
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.120]   and maybe we...
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.940]   And you just start thinking about it.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.000]   You're loading, you know, you're thinking about it.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.100]   You're trying to make sense of it.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.860]   You sit down and you send out the emails.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.580]   You update all your to-do list.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.540]   You go in your calendar.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.760]   You're like, this is great.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.940]   This is all out of my mind.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.540]   And I still have 10 minutes left.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.180]   Now I can just reset.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.460]   All right, what's next?
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.680]   So we have a ritual there following shallow work
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   to process all the details, close all the loops
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.180]   and give your brain a breather.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.020]   So again, a shallow work ritual that could be important.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.300]   I'll give you one more as long as we're thinking about it.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.140]   What about physical tasks?
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.700]   I gotta get this thing from the store and mail this letter.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.500]   Put those all together.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.900]   Say, great, I put these all together.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.100]   I have a whole hour.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.620]   I'm listening to, you know,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.820]   I have a book I'm excited to listen to on tape
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.700]   and I'm just gonna use this almost meditatively.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.740]   Just I have this big list.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.260]   I can start checking things off while I'm here.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.700]   I'll go to this store, then I'll go to that store
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.980]   and just sort of feel this feel of just physical progress
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.700]   of tasks being checked off your list
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.540]   while you're listening to an interesting book or something
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.740]   and make that into a whole organized ritual
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.640]   of I'm now in task mode and I'm really leaning into it.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.300]   So I think the bigger point here, Mark,
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.180]   which you've sparked in me, which I'm liking,
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.140]   is this notion that shallow work can be
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.700]   as cognitively demanding as deep work in certain aspects,
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.980]   in particular, when it comes to the complexity
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.460]   of the context surrounding different types of shallow work.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.540]   So having some rituals that respect that
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.040]   might make the same shallow work seem much easier.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.100]   So we shouldn't be dismissive about shallow work.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.500]   Well, that's just something you can do whenever
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.380]   and it's easy and all I care about is the deep work.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.100]   I really need to care about my mind.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.380]   We gotta care about our minds for everything we do
