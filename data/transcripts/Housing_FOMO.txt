[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, I want to talk
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.880]   about investing FOMO, but specifically housing FOMO, because I think housing FOMO, or the
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   fear of missing out, might be the most dangerous type of FOMO there is. And I was catching
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.840]   up with my softball buddy, who has been in Tesla stocks since 2018. It's done well, unfortunately,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.760]   2021 has been terrible for growth and tech. And I just couldn't understand why he wouldn't
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   take my advice and invest in housing in 2020. Because we were literally at batting practice
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.080]   every week, we're talking about our investments, we're talking about housing, he had gotten
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.200]   married a year earlier. And I realized why he's not as enthusiastic. He's not enthusiastic,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.120]   one because he doesn't like to pay property taxes, which is definitely a negative for
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.680]   real estate versus stocks. But he's not as enthusiastic because he doesn't have kids
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.960]   yet. And it was kind of my aha moment to try to understand why I wasn't able to convince
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.160]   him to go long housing in 2020. And even in 2021, he's not very enthusiastic either. Whereas
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.960]   it seems like the whole nation, North America, all around the world, people are. My friend
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.360]   is 38 years old, his wife, I think is 30 years old. So they have plenty of time to have kids
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.000]   if they want. The point I'm trying to tell him now is that you should probably go long
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.640]   before having kids if you want to have kids. Because once you have kids, something happens
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.320]   to our brains. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, parents. But there is this intense, intense
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.280]   desire to nest, to buy property to shelter your most precious asset, which is your baby.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   So greed, I think can definitely explain housing FOMO. But I think it's kids having kids is
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.500]   what really moves the needle and makes people kind of nuts and overbid on properties they
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.400]   probably shouldn't have. You know, if you're in a bidding war with 10 other people, and
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.760]   you win, I'm not sure if that's a good idea, because that means only you were willing to
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.860]   pay that price out of nine other people, right? So in that sense, you are creating new highs
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.000]   in the market, probably. And you've got to really be comfortable with your job situation,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.160]   your investments, and your desire to live in that area for at least probably at least
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.920]   three years, if not five or 10 years, to be able to make money from your house. Before
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.760]   I had kids, folks, I didn't really care if the house was within walking distance of a
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.840]   good elementary school or middle school or high school. Before I had kids, I didn't really
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   care if my yard wasn't that big or wasn't really on a flat lot. I just wanted something
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.920]   great to live in that would hopefully go up in value over time because I was trying to
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.560]   build my wealth and my passive income streams for retirement. And now that I have kids,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.880]   the way I look at potential properties to buy is a little bit different now. It might
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.000]   be a lot different. I still go through the numbers. I try to do a blue sky scenario,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   a realistic scenario, and a bear market pessimistic scenario to make sure that I can survive those
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.120]   bad times. But when I look at a property, I look at the layout. So in the kitchen, if
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.280]   I'm washing the dishes or whatnot, I can hopefully still see the kids running around in the living
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.600]   room or the dining room area. So in other words, I'm looking for an open floor plan.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.200]   In terms of outdoor space, I'm looking for as much outdoor space as possible, hopefully
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.120]   on as much flat land as possible. In terms of decks, I love decks, indoor, outdoor living.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.080]   It's the Hawaiian way, the lanai's because it's always nice and warm. Well, in San Francisco,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.600]   it's not always warm, but it's pretty nice. And I love that indoor, outdoor living. And
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.880]   I love homes with decks on every single level. However, now that I have kids, you know, decks
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.520]   might be a little bit dangerous if they're very, very high up from the floor below. And
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.280]   I also look at the railings. Are they horizontal or vertical? Are they narrow enough so the
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.440]   kids can fit through? All these little things change once you have kids. But the biggest
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.160]   thing, the most important thing is that I want property more. I desire property more
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.040]   because it provides more utility because it is housing more heartbeats, more people. And
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.240]   given young kids are so helpless, it just feels like you want to have a fort, you want
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.600]   to have the most expansive house with the tallest walls and the safest environment you
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.320]   can provide for your family. In conclusion, I would say you should probably buy a house
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.120]   before having kids if you know you plan to have kids. And if the kids never come, well,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.160]   at least you'll have a property that you'll enjoy that will hopefully appreciate and value
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.000]   if you follow my 3033 rule for home buying and don't overstretch. At the same time, if
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.080]   you're a real estate investor, it's important to understand demographics. And unfortunately,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.960]   during the pandemic, there's been a baby bust, not as many families and couples are having
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.040]   kids. So maybe in 3040 years, there's also going to be a drop off in housing demand.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.880]   We don't know exactly what's going to happen in that far in the future. But that might
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.440]   happen and might hurt housing. At the same time, I think real estate has become a part
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.560]   of more and more Americans retirement investing portfolio, right in the past, we would just
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.320]   buy a primary residence and pay it off after 30 years or hopefully before 30 years. And
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.360]   you can live very cheaply and very comfortably in your largest asset. But now things are
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   a little bit different. To go long real estate, people are buying more than the primary residence.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.400]   And instead of one person buying one property in the future, it might be one person buying
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.000]   1.2 properties in the future 1.5. And that multiplier effect probably will increase,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.040]   given its human nature to try to accumulate more assets over time as they get wealthier.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.160]   I want to leave you guys with an analogy regarding buying property when the woman is pregnant
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.120]   or when you've just had a baby. It's exactly like going to the supermarket after not eating
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.000]   all day, or maybe two days, you're just rabid. And you irrationally start gathering and buying
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.040]   all these things you think you'll need that you probably don't really need. And you're
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.880]   more apt to overbid on a property. So for those of you out there looking to buy property,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   please stay calm and run the numbers. And for those of you who are long property, I
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.040]   would just keep on riding this wave. The double digit returns, the price gains aren't going
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.000]   to last because of the base effect. Surely the price growth is going to decelerate. It
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.580]   just cannot go at this rate. But I still think we're going to see mid to high single digit
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.880]   year over year price increase over the next three years. All right, folks, thanks for
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.800]   listening. I hope you enjoyed this episode. I'm going to try to record more episodes going
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.240]   forward, but shorter in nature because they're easier to record. More pithy under 10 minutes
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.920]   that has a key point and something interesting to talk about during the times. If you enjoyed
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.880]   this episode, I'd appreciate a positive review and a comment. It's a motivating factor, man.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.240]   It's been a long pandemic, 14 plus months, folks. I think we're almost there. Let's let's
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.000]   hang in there. Take care.
