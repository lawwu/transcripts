[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   AJ from New Hampshire writes in with today's question.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   "Hello Pastor John. While the disunity of the church in terms of its denominations is,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   in my mind, one of the most tragic and devastating developments in church history,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   the fact is that a plethora of denominations now exists in the world in general,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and in the U.S. in particular, and each has its own strengths and each has its own weaknesses.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   In light of this reality, would you please share how and why you decided to become a Baptist?"
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Well, before I say a word about why I'm a Baptist,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   let me go ahead and respond to a little bit of what he said about the divisions in the church,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   because that is painful and it is real, and we all need to have a way to think about it,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   and they do relate to each other.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Divisions, some behavioral, some doctrinal, have been there in the church from the beginning.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Paul addresses this most explicitly, it seems, in 1 Corinthians.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   He says, "I hear that there are divisions among you, and I believe it in part,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized."
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   That's 1 Corinthians 11, 18.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And what we hear in that sentence, it seems to me, is—and in the whole Old Testament,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I mean New Testament for that matter—is that disagreements and their resulting divisions
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   are lamentable and inevitable in this world, owing, as best as I can see, to sin, finiteness,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   cultural diversity, personality differences, and so on.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   You can hear the lament in 1 Corinthians 1, 10, where he says,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and with the same judgment."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And you hear the inevitability of it in the text that I already mentioned, namely 1 Corinthians 11, 19.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   "There must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So it seems to me that all of us who are Christians need to decide how we will do our part
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   to minimize the lamentable divisions and not be paralyzed or utopian in our view of the inevitability
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   of divisions until Jesus comes back.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It seems to me that top-down efforts at global unity inevitably lay claim to powers that belong only to Jesus.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And I think you can see that in the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   When I look for guidance in the New Testament about how to minimize lamentable divisions,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   what I find is not an emphasis on institutional structures claiming to give a unified public front
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   to hundreds of subgroups like macro-ecumenical organizations.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Rather, what I find is a repeated effort to overcome pride and selfishness and vain glory
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and to work for a common mindset of doing good to others even when you are at odds with each other for some reason.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And the best example I know of this is found in Philippians 2, 2 through 4.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And watch now how Paul moves from a call to one-mindedness to a call for humility and service.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Here's the way it goes.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   "Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And now here's how he fleshes it out. Next verse.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   We can't control unity of belief, but we can give ourselves to serve each other in love.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   You can't force unity of belief because beliefs are not mere actions of the will, but deep delights of the heart.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So the only way ultimately to pursue unity of belief is to speak the truth in love.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Unity not based on truth is just not biblical unity.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And speaking that truth must happen in love if we hope to make any progress in unity.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So what I think all that means for each of us is that we search the scriptures, try to discern what we see to be true,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and then we give ourselves to the communities of faith that share that truth.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And we seek in love and service to maintain the unity of those communities in lowliness and humility and kindness and meekness and gentleness and forbearance and forgiveness.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And we do our best to love those in other communities so that the world will see our love, not just our disagreements.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Now, the reason I'm a Baptist is first very simply because I grew up in a Baptist home.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Let's just be honest.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But then with every stage of my education, first Wheaton, then Fuller Seminary, then the University of Munich in Germany,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   where I was the only Baptist that I knew of in the entire theological faculty there at the University of Munich.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   At every stage, the challenges to my Baptist commitments became more and more intense.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So I had to test my inherited convictions by scriptures over and over again during those 10 years, especially of higher education.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And to this day, I have not been able to be persuaded that baptizing infants is warranted by the New Testament.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   That's the main reason that I'm a Baptist.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I don't believe in infant baptism.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Now, this is probably not the place to go into any exegetical defense of that, but I'm willing to if we want to do it in another podcast.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   The point here should probably simply be that for me to be a gospel-believing, Bible-guided Christian is foremost.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Second in priority is to embrace the gospel-embodying, gospel-protecting, Bible-rooted, joy-sustaining, God-glorifying doctrines of grace.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And only third, I would say, are my Baptist convictions, and that enables me then to have a good bit of fellowship outside my own denominational connections.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And I hope that through my writings and speaking, the truth of Scripture is being promulgated in the world in such a way that more and more people are brought closer and closer to the central truths and therefore to each other.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Excellent priority as well.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I, for one, am glad that you're a Baptist and a Reformed Baptist at that, and a pioneer for so many of us who have followed you along this path.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And we'll keep infant baptism, that question, for another time.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   If you have a question, you can email it in to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Friday, we're going to talk about revival.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   What is revival?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   How does it start?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   What does it look like today?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And how similar is it to personal revival?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Looking forward to all of those questions.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   [End of Audio]
