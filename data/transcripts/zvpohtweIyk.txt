[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:14.160]   epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5 and dealing particularly with verse 25. "Husbands,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.080]   love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it." But as that is
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.760]   merely the introduction to the section, I want to read from that verse 25 to the end of the chapter,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.520]   that we may have the whole picture in our minds as we come to consider the particular parts.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.960]   "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.720]   that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.000]   present it to himself a glorious church, not having spots or wrinkle or any such thing,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.600]   but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.080]   bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself, for no man ever yet hated his own flesh,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.920]   but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.960]   of his flesh and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.720]   and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.160]   but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.960]   so love his wife even as himself, and the wife see that she reverence her husband."
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.680]   Now here, you see, we come to the Apostle's teaching concerning the duties of husbands
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:10.360]   towards their wives. Let us be clear in our minds again as to why he does this. He is not
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.720]   concerned simply to give the Christian teaching with regard to a number of matters. He's got a
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.360]   great general object here, and that is to show how Christians are essentially different from
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.440]   non-Christians in every respect, and that this is something which is to show itself in all the
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.760]   relationships of life. The great characteristic is that Christians are to be filled with the
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.000]   Spirit, and because they are filled with the Spirit, they will all be one, and they will
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.960]   manifest this glorious unity, harmony, peace, and joy. They will manifest, in other words,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.760]   the fruit of the Spirit, which is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.120]   goodness, faith, temperance, and so on. Now, he wants them to see how this is going to happen
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.160]   everywhere. He starts with it in the realm of the Church. We've considered that, but he says,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.240]   "It's got to happen everywhere." So we are to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:23.720]   Christ. But there is no place in which this can be shown so clearly as in the realm of the family
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.520]   and of the home life. There we are, and everybody's watching and observing. The non-Christians are
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.200]   watching, and there is no greater opportunity for displaying the glories of the Christian life
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:46.040]   than in the home life and the married life. That's where we're all seen as we are—not in church,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.120]   not taking a meeting, but on our own hearth at home. Strangers come in and we pull ourselves
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.680]   up, but it's what we are when we're off guard that really proclaims exactly what we are.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.440]   Therefore, there is a marvelous and a wonderful opportunity for us all here to testify—this
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.000]   is the way to testify—to the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's not very easy to speak,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.480]   but can we practice it? Can we live it? It's the life that has always been the greatest testimony
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.200]   to the Christian faith. People say, "Oh, it's very easy to get up and make a statement like that,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   but I wonder what that meant that woman is really like, if you had to live with him or live with her."
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.400]   And of course, it's a perfectly good test. So the apostle takes up this whole question of the
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.440]   relationship of wife and husband and husband and wife. We've been looking at what he has to say
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.840]   to the wives, and now we come to what he has to say to the husbands. And here it is, in this
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.200]   remarkable statement that he makes from verse 25 to the end of the chapter. It's remarkable in two
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.680]   main respects, isn't it? One, in what it tells us about the duties of husbands, but it is still
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.360]   more remarkable in what it tells us about the relationship of the Lord Jesus Christ to the
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.320]   Christian church. That is, of course, one of these astounding things about this man's letters always.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.720]   You never know when you're going to find a pearl, a pearl of greatest price. And here, in this
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.680]   essentially practical part of this epistle, he suddenly throws out the most exalted and
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.360]   wonderful statement he's ever made, anywhere, about the nature of the Christian church and
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:48.320]   her relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ. So you observe that in treating this matter of
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.480]   husbands and how they are to behave towards their wives, he also treats that other matter,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   and he gives both of them this particular treatment. The two things, as you notice,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.640]   are intertwined. So perhaps our first business this morning is to arrive at some kind of a
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.880]   division of the matter, because he moves from one to the other and then back to the first.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.120]   That is often his method. He doesn't always make a complete statement on the one side and then
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.080]   apply it. He'll give a part of his statement, apply it, and then another part and apply it.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   Well, therefore, I suggest some classification such as this. In verses 25, 26, and 27,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.960]   he tells us about what Christ has done for the church and why he has done so. That's verses 25
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:51.520]   to 27. Then in verses 28 and 29, he gives us a preliminary deduction from that as to the duty
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:00.320]   of a husband towards a wife, especially in terms of the union that subsists between Christ and the
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.720]   church and the husband and the wife. That's 28 and 29. But then in part of 29 and 30 and 32,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.600]   he develops this marvellous doctrine of the mystical union between Christ and the church.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:31.360]   That's part of 29, 30, and 32. And then in verses 31 and 32, he draws—31 and 33, rather—he draws
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:42.640]   his final practical deductions. Now that seems to me to be the analysis of the verses as we find
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:52.000]   them before us. But in order that we may grasp his teaching perhaps more clearly, I suggest that we
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.160]   approach it like this. First of all, we start with his general injunction, "Husbands, love your wives."
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.880]   That's the big thing that he's anxious to say. In other words, the controlling idea
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.880]   with regard to the husbands is this matter of love. You remember that the controlling idea
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.480]   with respect to the wives was the element of submission.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:28.320]   Wives, submit yourselves. Husbands, love your wives. Submission on the part of the wife,
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.600]   love on the part of the husband. Now, we must be clear about this. This doesn't mean, of course,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.240]   that it is the husband only that is to love. He doesn't say a word here about the wives loving
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.600]   their husbands, somebody may say. Well, of course, that's to misunderstand the apostle's object
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:54.880]   altogether. He's not giving us an exhaustive treatise here on marriage. But in his idea of
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.400]   the wife submitting herself, love is implicit. You see, what the apostle is concerned to do is
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:09.040]   this. He's really concerned about one big point only, and that is about harmony and peace and
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:18.480]   unity as it is displayed in the married relationship and in the home. So, that being his leading theme,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.320]   he picks out on the two sides the element that needs to be emphasised above every other.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.520]   The thing the wife has got to keep her eye on in maintaining the harmony is this element of
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.320]   submission. The thing the husband has got to keep his eye on is this element of love.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:42.560]   So, you see, he's picking out the chief characteristic, the chief contribution that
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.040]   is to be made by each of the partners in this wonderful relationship which can display
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.880]   the glory of the Christian life so marvellously. Very well. The word that comes, therefore,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:06.320]   to every husband is "husbands, love your wives." Now, this is most important, of course,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.600]   particularly in connection with the previous teaching. It safeguards the previous teaching,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.920]   and it's very important, therefore, that we should look at it in that way. He's been emphasising that
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:27.440]   the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church. We've seen that
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:34.560]   he is in the position of leadership, that he is the Lord of the wife. That's the teaching of the
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.160]   Old Testament and the New, and the apostle has been emphasising that. But, you see, immediately
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:48.720]   adds this. "Husbands, love your wives. You are the head, you are the leader, you are, as it were,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.520]   the Lord in this relationship." Yes, but because you love your wives, the leadership will never
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:03.200]   become a tyranny. And though you are a Lord, you will never become a tyrant. You see, that is the
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.920]   connection between the two things. And this is something which is found very generally in the
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:18.080]   teaching of the New Testament. Let me give you an example. In many ways, the best commentary on
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.520]   this matter that we are looking at this morning is to be found in Paul's second epistle to Timothy
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.440]   in the first chapter and the seventh verse, where he says this. "God," he says, "hath not given us
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:38.000]   the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind," which means discipline.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Now, there you see exactly the same thing again. God hasn't given us a spirit of fear. Well,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.480]   what's he given? Well, it's a spirit of power, yes, but lest a man think that this is something
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:56.800]   tyrannical, he adds, "and love." It's the power of love. It isn't naked power. It isn't the power
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   of a dictator or a little tyrant. It isn't a man who arrogates unto himself certain rights and
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.360]   tramples upon his wife's feelings and so on, and just sits there as a dictator. I was referring
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   the other Sunday morning to what was perhaps the greatest defect in the whole Victorian outlook
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.000]   upon life and even its Christianity, and it was just this very thing. They emphasize one side at
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.640]   the expense of the other, and so many of our problems today are due to a reaction, a violent
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:36.640]   overreaction against that false emphasis of that particular period. We must ever maintain this
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.360]   balance, therefore. You see, power is to be tempered by love. It's to be controlled by love.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.080]   It is the power of love. And it's no use a husband saying that he's the head of the wife unless he
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.480]   loves the wife. He's not carrying out the scriptural injunctions. So you see, these things,
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:02.560]   they go together. In other words, it is a manifestation of the Spirit.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.680]   And the Holy Spirit not only gives power, but he always gives love and also discipline.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:16.640]   So as the husband exercises his privileges as the head of the wife and the head of the family,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:23.040]   he does so in this way that he's controlled by love and he's controlled by discipline.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.880]   He disciplines himself. There may be the tendency to dictate he mustn't do it.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:36.320]   Power, love, sound mind, discipline. Now all that is implicit here in this great word love.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:43.040]   So the reign of the husband is to be a reign and a rule of love, and it's a leadership of love.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:53.120]   It's not the idea of a pope or a dictator. It's not his ipsy-dixie. He doesn't speak ex-cathedra.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:01.200]   No, no. It's the power of love. It's the discipline of the Spirit guarding this power
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.680]   and authority and dignity which are given to the husband. Now that is clearly the
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:14.560]   fundamental and the controlling idea in the whole of this matter. Husbands,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.760]   love your wives. It's a command as well as an exhortation.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:28.240]   But now we must proceed to consider in general the character or the nature of that love.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   And this is something that is very much needed at the present time.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.920]   There are two things very obvious in the world today, the abuse of the idea of power
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:49.600]   and the still greater abuse of the idea of love. The world has never been talking so much about
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.480]   love as it is today, and using its terms of endearment, I wonder whether there's ever been
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.400]   a time when there has been less love. These great terms are utterly debased,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.000]   so that many people have no idea as to the meaning of the word love. Husbands,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:16.960]   love your wives. Well, what is this love? Well, unfortunately for us, the apostle tells us,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:25.760]   and he tells us here in two ways. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:32.160]   But there are two definitions there, I say. The first is in the very word love.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.440]   The very word that the apostle has used here for love is most eloquent in its teaching and
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:49.840]   in its meaning. In the New Testament there are three words that are used in the Greek,
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:57.840]   in the original language, to convey teaching concerning this matter. And the three words,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:05.200]   unfortunately, are translated in our Bibles by the word love. So that when you come across the
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.040]   word love in the New Testament, it's very important that you should know which of the three
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:18.800]   the apostle really used. Let me illustrate what I mean. The first word is the word eros,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:29.120]   which is a description of something that belongs entirely to the flesh.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:36.240]   The word, the adjective erotic, will remind us of all the content of that word.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.280]   Now that is translated as love, and of course it is a kind of love.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:48.640]   But it is a love of the flesh, it is a desire, it is something carnal.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:58.000]   And the characteristic of that kind of love is that it is selfish. Now it's not of necessity
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.040]   wrong because it's selfish, but that kind of love is essentially selfish. It is born, as I say,
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.160]   of desire. It wants something, and it's mainly concerned about that. That's its level.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:18.320]   It is, if you like, the animal part in man. But it is translated as love, and that of course is
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:24.160]   what passes as love in the world today. You read about these marvellous romances, how wonderful it
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.720]   is. Nothing is said of course about the fact that a man's been unfaithful to his wife, and that the
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.000]   little children are going to suffer. A wonderful romance has come into his life. He and the woman
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.640]   he's going to marry now, they've both been guilty of terrible... That's not mentioned. This wonderful
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.800]   love match, this wonderful romance, you're familiar with it in the papers every day.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.040]   That's nothing but this erotic, selfish, fleshly, lustful desire.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.760]   But I'm reminding you that that is translated sometimes as love.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.840]   Then the next word is a word which really means to be fond of,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:15.520]   phileo. A word which comes in as a root very often in words like philanthropy and so on,
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:23.280]   Philadelphia, love of men and so on. Well now here is another word which is translated as love.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:30.880]   But what it really means is to be very fond of. Now let me give you the classical illustration
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.200]   concerning this. It's in the last chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John. I turn to it in
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.800]   order that we may have the notion clearly in our minds. You remember the incident when Peter and
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.840]   the others had gone fishing, and they come back and they see our Lord on the seashore. And there
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:56.160]   he is cooking this breakfast for them, and then he begins to speak to them. And you remember this
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:05.760]   is what we read. So when they had dined, verse 15, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:15.760]   lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:24.320]   He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. Now then when Peter says there, Thou knowest that I love thee,
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.600]   the word Peter used was, Thou knowest that I am fond of thee. Our Lord asks him if he really
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.960]   loves him, with the third word to which we haven't yet come. But Peter replies,
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:45.920]   Thou knowest that I am fond of thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith unto him again
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:54.080]   the second time, Simon son of Jonas, Lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:02.560]   that I love thee. Which means, Thou knowest that I am fond of thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.920]   Then we come to verse 17, He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:17.040]   Lovest thou me? Now here our Lord does a very interesting thing. He doesn't use the word he'd
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.240]   been using before. He uses the word that Peter had been using. He says, He saith unto him the
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:28.960]   third time, Simon son of Jonas, Are you really fond of me? He's lowered the conception.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:37.360]   Art thou really fond of me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:43.760]   Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou knowest that I
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.280]   love thee. Now Peter has gone up here. He no longer says, Thou knowest that I am fond of thee.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.200]   He's gone to a higher level. Thou knowest that I love thee. But let's keep these things in mind.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.600]   The word translated as love may mean being fond of, but there is this third word.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.680]   The highest word of all, translated as love.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:13.040]   And this is the word that is always used in the Bible to express God's love to us.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:24.320]   God so loved the world, Agapas. Now this is the love which is used in our text this morning.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:34.640]   Husbands, love your wives. In that sense, love as God loves. There's nothing higher than this.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.720]   Or to put it in another way, you remember the list of the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5,
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.520]   22. The apostle is contrasting the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.320]   and he says the fruit of the Spirit is love. Not that erotic thing, not merely being fond of. No,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:04.160]   no, this love that characterizes God's love. Love, joy, peace, and so on. Now then, that is the love
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   which the apostle says here that husbands should have and show towards their wives. And you see
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.240]   how it all links up so perfectly with the 18th verse. "Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess,
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.400]   but be filled with the Spirit." And if you are filled with the Spirit, you'll be filled with
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.360]   the fruit of the Spirit. And the fruit of the Spirit is love. Now he's addressing people who
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.080]   are filled with the Spirit. They alone can do this. It's no use saying this to a man who's
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.440]   not a Christian. He's incapable of it. He cannot love with this sort of love. But the apostle
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.800]   says that Christians are to manifest this kind of love because they are filled with the Spirit.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.520]   So one of the ways in which I show that I'm filled with the Spirit is not that I speak in tongues or
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.800]   go into ecstasies or manifest certain phenomena in meetings. No, no, it's the way I behave towards
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:58.400]   my wife when I'm at home. It is this love which is the fruit of the Spirit. Very well now then,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:05.680]   the very word that the apostle selected leads us immediately into the whole notion that he's
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   anxious to convey. Let me put it like this, therefore. Let's try and get this whole question
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:21.120]   of marriage and the married relationship into focus. I am not saying that the apostle is
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:27.360]   teaching here that that first element which belongs to the flesh should not come in at all.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   That's very wrong. You see, there have been people who've taught that. The whole Roman
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.840]   Catholic teaching concerning celibacy is ultimately based on that. And there are many
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:47.280]   Christian people, I find, who are in trouble over this. They seem to think that the Christian person
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:55.360]   is no longer human, no longer natural. And they regard sex as evil. Now that is not only not
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:04.080]   Christian teaching. It is error. It is wrong. It is to come in. Man's a man. God made him thus.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.520]   God has given us these gifts, sex included. There is nothing wrong in the erotic element
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.200]   in and of itself. Indeed, I go further. I say it should be present.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:22.960]   I'm elaborating this because I am so often in a position where I'm asked to deal with these
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.520]   things. I have met, I have known Christian people who very honestly, because of this wrong view of
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   sex and of that which is natural, even in the life of the Christian, have more or less come to this
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:44.400]   conclusion. That any Christian man can marry any Christian woman. You see, what matters now is
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:52.240]   that we are Christians. They do away altogether with the natural, but the Bible doesn't. No, no,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.720]   though we are all Christians, it is right that we should feel attracted more to one than to another.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:06.480]   The natural comes in. Don't exclude it. We mustn't ever take up that position that any one of us
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.320]   could quite rightly marry another. You might live together, but that's to exclude this natural.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.240]   Now, I was at Pains last Sunday morning and the previous Sunday morning to show that the
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.360]   Christian teaching does never do away with the natural, with the way in which God has created us.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.600]   And God has created us in that way, that one feels an attraction to another more than to another
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:35.360]   person. And it's mutual. And that is perfectly right. Don't do away with it. That's being assumed
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.400]   here. The apostle is assuming that this man has married this woman because they were attracted
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.640]   to one another. Because, if you like to use the current phrase, they fell in love. Christians
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.720]   should do that like everybody else. This is not something mechanical. A Christian doesn't say,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.920]   "Now I'm a Christian. I'm going to look around and decide in cold blood." That's not biblical
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.360]   teaching. Well, you can laugh at it, my friends, but I can assure you that there are many Christians
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:06.400]   who have acted on that very principle. I am speaking out of pastoral experience. And they're
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:14.240]   very honest people. Regarding sex as evil, they get into this false position. No, no, we're not
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.960]   to exclude the natural. The apostle is assuming that this man and this woman have felt this mutual
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:27.520]   attraction. They've been drawn together on that basis. More than that, he's assuming this, that
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.200]   they're fond of one another. What I mean by that is this, that they like the companionship of one
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:41.520]   another. Now, let me emphasize again that that is to come into Christian marriage also. There
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:50.720]   are certain natural affinities, and we ignore them at our peril. Again, I've often seen this.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:56.080]   Two people have imagined that because they're Christians, everything's going to be all right,
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:02.720]   and they get married on that basis. But you know, it's very important in the marriage state that you
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.040]   should be fond of one another. If you're not fond of one another and have married on the basis of
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:16.880]   the first thing only, it'll soon go. That has no permanence in it. This is one of the things that
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:24.160]   has permanence. You're fond of one another. There are certain imponderables in this marriage state.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.760]   It's good that people who are married should have the same affinities, the same interests,
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.880]   should be attracted by the same things. It doesn't matter how much they love one another.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   If there are fundamental differences in this respect, it will lead to great trouble.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.640]   The problem of married life and living in harmony will be very much greater. It's very important,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.320]   I say, that this second element, the word that Peter kept on using, "I am fond of thee," should
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.840]   come in. Now, the apostle is assuming both of those. You see, these people got married while
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.560]   they were pagans, probably, and they got married because of those two elements. All right,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.480]   says Peter, this is where Christianity comes in. Now, because you're Christians, the other element
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:10.800]   comes in, and it lifts up the other two. It sanctifies them. It gives a glory to them.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.720]   It gives a splendor to them. That's the difference that Christ makes to marriage.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.160]   It is only the Christian who is able to rise to this level.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:27.840]   You see, you can have happy and successful marriages without this. They do happen still,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:33.520]   thank God. There are happy marriages on the normal, the natural, the human level,
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.720]   and they are based on the first two words which I've already been using. If you get the first,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.840]   plus this fondness for one another, and a certain temperament, it can be a very happy and successful
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.480]   marriage. Yes, but it'll never rise to this other level, and this is where the apostle Paul wants
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:58.880]   us to come to. That over and above what is possible to the natural, there comes in this true love,
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.080]   this love that is in God, the thing he talks about in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.520]   Very well, the apostle, you see, in choosing his word has told us a great deal, hasn't he?
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:17.360]   And every husband in this congregation must examine himself in the light of this word.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.760]   Are the three elements present in you?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:34.480]   Is everything crowned and glorified by this love that can be used even of God himself?
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.800]   But lest we be in any trouble, the apostle comes down and gives us a further illustration in the
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:51.600]   second point he makes, which is this. Husbands, love your wives even as, even as Christ also
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:30:02.320]   loved the church. Now then, you see, he's anxious to help us. The very mention of the name Christ
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:09.760]   leads him at once to elaborate the whole thing. He can't just say, "Even as Christ loved the church,"
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.640]   he must go on and say, "and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.760]   the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.880]   not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish."
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:30.720]   He says all that to help the husband to love his wife as he ought to love his wife.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:37.520]   Why then, I say, does he elaborate it like this? Well, I think there are three main reasons for
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:44.320]   that. He wants, first of all, every one of us to know Christ's great love to us.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   He wants us to realize the truth about Christ and ourselves in our relationship to Christ.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.240]   Why is he so concerned about this? Well, his argument is this, you see.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:07.840]   It is only as we realize the truth about the relationship of Christ to the church that we
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.480]   can really function as Christian husbands ought to function. You notice he puts it at the end by
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.240]   saying, "this is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church." But why is
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.600]   he speaking concerning Christ and the church? Why has he led them into the mystery? In order that
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:31.760]   husbands might know how to love their wives. And that is where these glib and superficial people
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.440]   who jeer at doctrine, and, "oh, they say those people, they're only interested in doctrine,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:42.400]   we are the practical people." You can't be practical without doctrine. You can't love your
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.080]   wife unless you understand something about this doctrine, about this great mystery. "Oh," say
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.320]   people, "it's too difficult, I can't follow all that." My dear friend, if you want to live as a
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.960]   true Christian, you've got to follow it. You've got to apply your mind. You've got to think,
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   you've got to study, you've got to try to understand it, you've got to grapple with it.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.160]   It's here for you, and if you turn your back on this, you're rejecting something God gives you,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.480]   and you're a terrible sinner. To reject doctrine is a terrible sin. You mustn't put practice
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.640]   against doctrine, you can't practice without it. So the apostle takes the trouble to elaborate
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:25.760]   this wonderful doctrine about the relationship of Christ and the church. Not simply for the sake of
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.400]   doing that, important though it is, but in order that you and I at home may love our wives as we
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.800]   ought to love them, even as Christ loved the church. Well, very well, let's look at it like
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:46.560]   this. The controlling principle, therefore, in practice is that the relationship between husband
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:54.960]   and wife is the same in essence and in nature as the relationship between Christ and the church.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:05.040]   How do we approach it, therefore? We approach it like this. We must start by studying the
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:12.320]   relationship between Christ and the church, and then and then only can we go and look at
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:20.240]   the relationship between the husband and the wife. That's what the apostle is doing. Husbands, love
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.920]   your wives even as Christ loved the church. Then he tells us exactly how Christ has loved the church.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:33.600]   Now then, he says, go and do the same. That's your rule. So our first big doctrine is, you see,
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.040]   there are two big matters here. First, the relationship of Christ and the church.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.280]   Secondly, coming out of it, the relationship of the husband and the wife.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:48.960]   We can only start this morning with the first, the relationship of Christ and the church.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.800]   Here is something that all must listen to, not only husbands, but everybody.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.160]   What we are told about the relationship of Christ and the church is true of every single one of us.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:08.320]   Christ is the husband of the church. Christ is the husband of every single believer.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.400]   Now you say, where do you find that? Well, I find that, of course, in the epistle to the Romans,
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:18.000]   chapter 7, verse 4. Listen. "Wherefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.920]   by the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead,
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:32.800]   that we should bring forth fruit unto God." Christ is the husband of the church.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.240]   The church is the bride of Christ.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:44.160]   Every one of us can, in that sense, look upon the Lord Jesus Christ as our husband,
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.200]   and collectively we do so as members of the Christian church.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:35:01.360]   What does he tell us about this? Well, the first thing he tells us, of course, is about the attitude
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:11.440]   of the Lord Jesus Christ to the church, how he looks upon her. Here is instruction for husbands.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:19.040]   What is your attitude? How do you look upon your wife? Well, now he tells us some marvellous things
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.920]   here. Christian people, had you realised that these things are true about you as members
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.520]   of the Christian church, look at the characteristics of our Lord's attitude towards his bride,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.720]   the church. He loves her.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.720]   Even as Christ loved the church, yes, but what an eloquent expression.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:50.160]   He loved her in spite of her unworthiness. He loved her in spite of her deficiencies.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.760]   You notice what he has got to do with her.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:05.040]   She needs to be washed, she needs to be cleansed. He saw her in her rags, in her vileness.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:12.400]   But he loved her. Here is the height of the doctrine of salvation.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:21.520]   He loved us not because of anything in us. He loved us in spite of it, while we were yet sinners.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:29.840]   He loved the ungodly while we were yet enemies. In all our unworthiness and vileness,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.440]   he loved us. He loved the church, not because she was glorious and beautiful,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:44.480]   no, but that he might make her such. You see the doctrine? You see what it has got to say to
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:50.080]   husbands? You come up against difficulties, deficiencies, things that you feel you can
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:56.720]   criticise. But you are the lovers. Christ loved the church. That is the sort of love.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.920]   Now that is the first principle. The second is this. He gave himself for her.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:09.600]   He was not only ready to sacrifice himself for her, he even did sacrifice himself for her.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   That is Christ's love for the church. He could only save her by giving his life for her.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:26.080]   And he gave his life. That is the characteristic of his love.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:33.440]   Then you notice his great concern for her and for her well-being.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   He is looking at her. He is concerned about her. He sees the possibilities as it were.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:52.640]   He desires her to be perfect. That is why he goes on to say that he might sanctify her,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.400]   cleanse her with the washing of water, by the word that he might present her to himself,
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:05.280]   a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. You see, his interest in her,
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:12.240]   his love for her, his pride in her. Those are the characteristics of Christ's love to the church.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:18.720]   This great desire, I say, that she should be perfect.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   And he is not going to be satisfied until she is perfect.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:34.320]   He wants to be able to present her to himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.760]   or any such thing. He wants her to be perfect, beyond criticism. He wants the whole world,
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.280]   as it were, to admire her. So we are told, we were told in the third chapter of this
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.640]   epistle, in verse 10, something like this, that he has done all this to the intent that now,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.080]   and to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places, might be known by the church
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.720]   the manifold wisdom of God. You see, it is the pride of the bridegroom in his wife,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.480]   proud of her beauty, proud of her appearance, proud of everything. And he wants to show her
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.960]   to the family, to everybody, the pride of the bridegroom in his bride. That is the sort of
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:20.320]   relationship that exists and subsists between the Lord Jesus Christ and his church. I am taking the
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:27.120]   principle, you see, out of the details first, because it gives us an understanding of this
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:35.680]   wonderful mystical relationship. And so the picture is of our Lord rejoicing in the relationship,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:42.160]   happy in it, triumphant in it, glorying in it. There is nothing that he will not do for her.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:54.800]   Now there, I say, is the first big matter that emerges in the apostle's treatment
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   of this great and exalted subject. We have got to start with this picture of Christ and the church.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.040]   You see how he looks upon her,
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.960]   what he does for her because he looks upon her like that,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.480]   what he has in view for her, his ultimate objective.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:32.720]   And because of all this, the relationship that exists between them, this extraordinary notion
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:39.120]   of the mystical relationship, the unity, that they are one flesh, that she is his body,
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.840]   and so on. Well, very well, we cannot proceed to consider that this morning.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:51.200]   But I do trust that you have got an outline clearly in your minds. Husbands,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:41:02.080]   love your wives even as Christ loved the church. Very well, there is our first great principle,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.520]   Christ loving the church. The relationship between Christ and the church is that which
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.200]   is to be between husband and wife. So start with that. Look at the great doctrine of the church.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.080]   Come all of you, married or unmarried, this is true of all of us. We are in the church,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.640]   very well, we are in this relationship to Christ.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:31.920]   That is how he looks at you. That is his attitude towards you.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.080]   You see, this principle is this, this love, this agapas, this thing which is altogether above
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.600]   the erotic and the philanthropic, as it were.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:54.400]   The great characteristic of this, and this is where it is essentially different from the others,
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:05.200]   is that this is not so much governed by desire and to have as to give.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   God so loved the world, how that he gave.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:17.120]   Now, there is nothing wrong with the other types of love, as I am saying, but you see,
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.800]   put them at their best, they are always self-centered, aren't they? They are always
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   thinking of themselves. But the characteristic of this other love is that it does not think
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:34.160]   of itself. He gave himself, he died for, even unto death, sacrifice. That is the characteristic.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.240]   This love is a love that gives, it is not considering what it is going to have,
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:45.840]   but what it may give for the benefit of the other. Husbands love like that, your wives,
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:54.000]   even as Christ loved the church. We have looked at his attitude towards the church.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:01.360]   We shall then, next Sunday, God willing, go on to show how that attitude manifests itself
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:10.640]   in practice, and then beyond that to its ultimate objective, and finally,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:20.080]   to the mystical relationship and union. Well, thank God that when you come to consider
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.560]   something like marriage, so common, apparently so ordinary, you see that if you are a Christian,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.560]   you have to consider it in such a way that brings you into the very center of Christian truth,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:40.640]   into the heart of theology and doctrine, into the mysteries of God in Christ as seen
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:46.800]   in and through the church. May God bless the consideration to us. Amen.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
