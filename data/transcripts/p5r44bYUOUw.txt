[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:16.720]   the 107th Psalm, Psalm 107, reading verses 4 to 9, from the 4th to the 9th verse in the
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   107th Psalm.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.760]   They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.520]   They found no city to dwell in.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.880]   Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.680]   Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.160]   and he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.840]   Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.520]   children of men!
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:08.560]   For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.920]   Those who were present here last Sunday evening will recall that we began the consideration
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.160]   of this great psalm on that occasion.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.640]   It is one of these great Old Testament hymns of praise and of thanksgiving unto God.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.980]   The man begins by saying, "Oh give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.560]   endureth forever.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.200]   Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, he says, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520]   enemy, and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west, from the
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.800]   north and from the south."
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.760]   We indicated there that its great theme is this praise that is offered to God for his
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.880]   goodness, because he is good, and because of the manifestation of his goodness in our
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.520]   salvation.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.240]   Praise to God for his mercy, which endureth forever.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.040]   In other words, the theme of the psalm can be put like this, that it is God alone who
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.760]   really can save us, that salvation comes only from the Lord.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.900]   That is its theme, which he expounds and puts to us in a number of different ways.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.200]   It is God who is to be praised, because apart from him there is no salvation, but in him
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   there is an abundant and a plentiful salvation.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.240]   As we were at pains to emphasize chiefly last Sunday night, this is for everybody, for all
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.720]   who seek it, for all who become conscious of their need, north and south, east and west,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.480]   irrespective of temperament, conditions, background, abilities, everything else.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.120]   It does not matter.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.040]   It is something that is available for all who seek it.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.180]   The psalmist goes on impressing upon us that particular truth.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.120]   It is, I say, for all who realize their distress and who are anxious to be delivered out of
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.360]   the hands of their enemy that holds them in such a terrible bondage.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.680]   He lays down that in those first three verses which we considered last Sunday night.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.720]   But having done that, he goes on to illustrate it.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.240]   He is not content merely with laying down a general proposition.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.000]   He now gives us examples and illustrations.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.480]   He is like a man, if you like, setting down a great thesis, and then he goes on to prove
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.480]   his thesis.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.640]   Or, if you like, and it is quite a legitimate thing, obviously, to do with a psalm which
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.200]   is a song.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.680]   It is like a great symphony.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.200]   He has his introduction and he tells us what he is going to do.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.400]   Then he does it in a number of movements, and then he gathers it all up together at
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.760]   the end.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.560]   It is indeed, therefore, a most artistic composition and something which calls for
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   our admiration in that sense and in that respect, quite in addition to its inherent spiritual
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.320]   truth and value.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.800]   Now we are beginning to consider these different cases which this man puts for our consideration.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:58.160]   He has got four main examples, and it is generally agreed that these four examples and illustrations
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.040]   which he gives us are undoubtedly to be used and to be interpreted metaphorically.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:14.360]   He describes people in certain physical conditions, and the truth is, of course, that God can
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.040]   deliver us and does deliver us out of physical conditions.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:28.840]   But in addition to that, and over and above that, physical deliverances are but parables
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.360]   and signposts pointing to what God does for us in an infinitely bigger manner in a spiritual
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.520]   sense and with respect to ourselves.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.320]   Now, I indicated last Sunday evening that it is very generally agreed that this is probably
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.280]   a psalm which has reference to the captivity of the children of Israel, and that is probably
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   so.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.020]   So all these pictures and illustrations that he uses can be thought of primarily in terms
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.640]   of the deliverance of the children of Israel out of their actual captivity.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:13.480]   But that in turn is nothing but a great picture of the deliverance which our souls have in
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:21.800]   Christ in a spiritual sense and out of our spiritual bondage and captivity.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.440]   Very well then, we say that they all are to be interpreted mainly in that metaphorical
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:33.040]   sense, and we shall do so with this first illustration this evening.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.000]   Another important point to bear in mind as we approach these examples and illustrations
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.560]   is this, that undoubtedly each one of them is meant to be a picture of sin.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.440]   Sin is something which is protean in its manifestations.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.160]   It is a small word, but it is very powerful.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:05.360]   And sin is something that manifests itself in an almost endless variety of ways.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.280]   That is a part of its subtlety, of course.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.240]   And it is because we fail to realize that sin does manifest itself in so many different
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.720]   ways that we sometimes do not recognize it even when we are looking at it.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.440]   We tend to think that sin always appears in the same way, but it does not.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.920]   Most people can recognize sin when it appears in rags, but many people do not recognize
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   it when it appears in evening dress.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.080]   Many people can recognize sin as it may manifest itself in the slum area of a great city, but
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.920]   they do not recognize it in the West End, but it is the same thing.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.160]   It has got many, many ways of showing itself.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.720]   If you like an illustration, sin is a disease that has many symptoms.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.080]   And the object of this, men, is to give us some examples of these different symptoms.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.280]   He shows us in every case how they have the same source.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.240]   It is sin at the root.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:13.040]   But his point is that whatever the manifestation of the disease, God can heal it.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.200]   God can deliver us from it.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.720]   In every case, he says, "Then in their distress they cried out unto the Lord."
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.240]   And every time he goes on to say, "And he delivered them out of their distresses."
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.600]   Now then, it does not matter what form sin may take, if we but cry unto the Lord, he
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.360]   will deliver us.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.900]   Let us now consider that as it is proved and illustrated by this first picture, which he
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.200]   gives us here in verses 4 to 9.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:57.960]   Here obviously we are looking at sin in terms of sin as that which causes us to lose our
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.040]   way.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.600]   One of the etymological definitions of sin is "missing the mark."
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.800]   It is one of the right definitions of sin.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   What is sin?
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.520]   Well, one thing that is true about sin is this.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.760]   It is that which causes a man to miss the mark.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.160]   He is aiming at a target, but sin comes in and the bullet is deflected and he does not
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.600]   hit the bull's eye.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.000]   Missing the mark.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Missing the way.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.880]   Not reaching the objective.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.960]   Stepping aside.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.480]   Being sidetracked.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:37.000]   Now this first illustration is one that gives us the most extraordinary, vivid, and dramatic
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.480]   picture of sin as that which causes us to lose ourselves in life and in this world,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.200]   and to miss the goal for which we were destined and intended.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.120]   Now then, let us look at the picture together first of all, and then draw some few principles
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.880]   of teaching from it.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.240]   This is of course a very common picture of sin in the Scriptures.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.600]   You will find it in many places.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   Now what is the sort of person that we are dealing with here?
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.080]   Listen to the description.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.880]   They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.240]   They found no city to dwell in.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.760]   Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:37.560]   Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.880]   There is the essence of the picture.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.640]   What kind of person are we looking at?
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:51.840]   Well, obviously, we are looking at the so-called intellectual type of person.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.760]   The picture is, you see, of people in a wilderness, a desert.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   What are they doing there?
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.960]   Well, they are trying to find a city of habitation.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.840]   They are looking for a city in which they can dwell and in which they can obtain certain
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.200]   satisfactions.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.440]   But the trouble is that they cannot find it.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.800]   They are in this wilderness which is a trackless waste.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.960]   There are no paths there that lead them to the city.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.040]   They wandered in the wilderness, you see.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.720]   They are going backwards and forwards, looking, seeking.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:39.160]   In a sense, it is the whole picture of the human race from the very dawn of history.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.440]   Man is looking for a city.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:49.480]   But in particular, I say, we are concerned with it, as it is depicted here, in the intellectual
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   sense.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.880]   It is a picture, if you like, of people who are out in the great search and quest for
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   truth.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:05.920]   It is a picture of men and women seeking for intellectual understanding and intellectual
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.520]   satisfaction.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.720]   They find themselves in this life and in this world, yes, but they have been given certain
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   gifts.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.080]   They have got a mind and it begins to become active, and they begin to ask questions.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080]   That is excellent.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.920]   It is as it should be.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.040]   One of the great questions which they ask themselves is this, "What is life?
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.800]   Where has it all begun?
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   Where has the world come from?
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.440]   Has it always existed?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.880]   Or did it come into being at a given point?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:47.240]   What is this extraordinary, elusive thing which we call life?
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.720]   What is it?"
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.440]   You look at an animal and he is full of life, bounding, active.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.080]   Suddenly you see that animal dead and lifeless.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.600]   The body is there, but the life has gone.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.840]   The same with a flower.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.440]   The same with man himself.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.760]   What is it?
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.880]   Now, any thoughtful person, any person with a brain and who really uses it, is bound to
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.400]   face these questions.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.600]   Now, these are the people that we are looking at here.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.960]   This intellectual type of person is really out for an understanding of life, its meaning,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   its purpose.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.280]   That is the city.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:32.800]   The city of intellectual rest, of intellectual satisfaction.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.960]   It is the search, and it is as old, I say, as men, for a whole philosophy of life, for
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:47.320]   a complete view of existence, including especially man himself.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.680]   If you like it in more technical terms, it is a search for the philosophy of life.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.320]   It is a search for a way of life.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.480]   It is a search for an outlook that rarely will be satisfactory.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:10.400]   Now, I am saying again that you simply have to read the history of mankind, and you will
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.840]   find that there has been nothing in it which has been more prominent than this very thing
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.160]   I am describing.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.000]   The intellectual activity of man has been tremendous.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.600]   He has been facing the mystery of life.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.080]   You will find it in ancient writings.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.840]   You will find it even in mythology.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.520]   Man is looking for some philosopher's stone, some crystal or something into which he can
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.840]   look and solve the riddle of existence and of the universe.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.800]   He is looking for the city, the city of truth.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:51.160]   He is seeking also not merely and not only intellectual satisfaction, but he also is
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.960]   seeking for rules for living, because living is a problem.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.160]   Human relationships, how to get on with other people, and so on.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.040]   Man is ever seeking for these rules, and he is seeking, in other words, for some kind
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:16.480]   of code or some kind of instruction that will enable him to do these things without constantly
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:23.240]   being immersed and overwhelmed in problems and being upset and cast down and frustrated.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.840]   He has always been looking for some kind of prescription, some law that can be dictated
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.600]   which will suddenly put all these things right.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.440]   Man is doing it as busily and as actively tonight as he has ever done it.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.960]   That is the type of person we are looking at.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:46.560]   Yes, not only that, it goes on and includes something further.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.600]   As we go on in life, we are ever aware of certain problems and difficulties arising.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.040]   There are certain riddles in life.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.680]   You see, because over and above our intellectual quest and the intellectual restlessness that
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.960]   asks for satisfactions and solutions, over and above that, and even as we are engaged
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.280]   in that, things happen to us.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   And man has been battling with this problem again from the very beginning.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:26.440]   All the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, all the buffetings and the bludgeonings of
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.380]   chance, that is the thing.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.880]   What can we do about these, especially how can we understand them?
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.640]   Why do these things happen to us?
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.440]   Why do things go wrong?
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.880]   Why is there illness?
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.240]   Why is there pestilence?
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.720]   Why are there storms?
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.500]   Why are there calamities?
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500]   Why are there wars?
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.080]   Those are the questions.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:55.720]   They come and they hit us in life, and man all along has been seeking to understand it.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.480]   Is there a purpose in it all or isn't there?
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:06.440]   Are we but a kind of life is life but a kind of chessboard, and are we but the men upon
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.600]   it that are being manipulated helplessly by some unseen forces?
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   What is it?
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.960]   Is it possible to reduce this total experience of ours in life and in this world to some
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.600]   ordered reason?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:29.720]   Can I discover the Philosopher's Stone, the answer to all these questionings and disturbances?
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.240]   Now we are looking at the kind of person who is concerned about all this, and there is
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:38.840]   one final thing I want to say about him.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   He is also searching for security.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.000]   He is searching for protection.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.120]   Now that is universally true, isn't it?
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.960]   It has never been more obvious perhaps in the world and in life than it is today.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.240]   Security is the great word.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.160]   We are all making pacts and the countries are making pacts.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.680]   We are all out for security, and the tragedy of life is that it is in our desire for security
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.160]   we provoke war.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.720]   But it is security we are out for.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.240]   The nations on the other side of the Iron Curtain are assuring the world tonight that
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.120]   they want nothing but security.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.680]   They feel that they are being menaced and attacked.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.280]   And the other half of the world is saying exactly the same thing.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:34.120]   We want security and we want it in an individual and in a personal sense also.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:43.320]   There are things that are always threatening us—illness, accident, old age, and death
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:50.200]   itself standing in the background always and never coming nearer and nearer to us.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.600]   There it is.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.240]   And man throughout his long existence in this world has been crying out for this security,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.120]   some protection, some tower of safety into which he can go in this evil day that is bound
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:10.280]   to come where he will be protected against it all and be able to recline in peace.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   That is the quest.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.360]   They are seeking for a city to dwell in, a city of habitation.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.060]   Now he puts it to us, you remember, in his thoroughly dramatic manner.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.440]   But what he really tells us about these people is this, that they clearly are not able to
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.200]   find the path.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.480]   It is a wilderness, it is a trackless waste.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.200]   They found no city to dwell in.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:41.360]   But I do want to consider this whole problem with you, this whole picture.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.240]   You do not need much imagination to see it, do you?
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.480]   Many of us have known it perhaps from personal experience.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.520]   I know quite a lot about this kind of person.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.440]   Let me tell you certain things about him.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.640]   You start out in this quest when you are young, and at first it is really most thrilling and
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.520]   most exciting.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.840]   You start off with the assured conviction that where everybody has failed before you,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.600]   you are going to succeed.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.740]   And every generation thinks the same thing.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.120]   Every generation is proud of itself and always despises previous generations.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.640]   Ah yes, they did not know, they had not advanced, they had not the knowledge we have got.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.040]   But after all, we are really going to do it.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.080]   It is very true today, isn't it?
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.640]   And you see, we start off like that, full of confidence, full of assurance, full of
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.000]   resilience.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.780]   Of course we say we are going to arrive at the city.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.280]   Of course we are going to get there.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:49.400]   So we set out full of this confidence and full of this assurance.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   And of course it is very exciting.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.560]   The quest itself is to us the thing.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.880]   It is most enjoyable.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.620]   And in this mood we rather tend to smile at older people and we say, "To travel hopefully
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.480]   is better than to arrive."
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:15.240]   The quest, you see, the exercise of the great brain we have, the intellectual curiosity.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.720]   We do not want to arrive, but it is this great intellectual exercise.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   It is amazing.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   It is thrilling.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.020]   It is so exciting.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.400]   So we rush into the wilderness and we are going to get a straight line through to the
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.200]   city of habitation.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:40.000]   The very thrill, I say, of the quest, the enjoyment of travelling, intellectual curiosity.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.280]   We want to read all sides, we say.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   Our minds are capacious enough to take it all in.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.320]   So we try this and we try that.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.080]   We go the round of the philosophies, perhaps the round of the religions.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   Why?
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   We are interested in truth.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.960]   We are really not selfish.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   We are not personal.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.840]   We are not talking about being saved or anything like that.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.600]   We just want to give a little scope to these great minds of ours and we want to garner
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.040]   knowledge and information from every direction.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:17.200]   So off we go with this thrilling enjoyment of this amazing quest for truth.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.800]   And of course as we enter into this wilderness to seek for this highway, we meet certain
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.240]   people who offer to guide us.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.160]   They are very ready to do so.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.680]   They are very glad to meet us.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.280]   And they are very pleased to meet somebody who really has a brain and who is intellectually
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:41.560]   alive and alert and who is able to laugh at the past and all that has been taught hitherto.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.960]   They are so delighted to meet us and they say, "Of course, you just follow me and
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.880]   listen to me and read my books and follow my lectures and I will bring you to the city
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.720]   of habitation and we go after them."
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   But we don't seem to arrive.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.680]   And then we meet another who tells us, "Of course, that was quite wrong.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.160]   That's out of date now.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   It's this.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.520]   This is the latest."
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.480]   And again we have the same charm and we go with the same eagerness, but again we don't
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   arrive.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.920]   Oh, my dear friends, I mustn't keep you.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.320]   I am not romancing.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.920]   I am simply describing to you what so many people are doing in this world at this very
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   moment.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.520]   They are going the round of the philosophers, the round of the teachers, the round of the
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.320]   cults, the round of all these things that are being offered to us as the solution of
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:39.400]   the problems of mankind.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.840]   But we don't seem to arrive at the city.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.280]   And after a while we discover that the very guides to whom we have trusted don't know
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.200]   where they are themselves.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   They haven't arrived either.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.320]   We may first of all perhaps discover it in their way of living and in their idea of morals,
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.160]   but at the minute we discover that they don't arrive in any sense at all.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.960]   We thought they were so wonderful, but they don't know.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.520]   They are false guides.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.920]   They have raised false hopes within us.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:16.440]   And we have done a round of so many of them.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.000]   And at last we begin to wonder.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.440]   We begin to feel that time is passing and that we are getting older, and we still are
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.200]   very much where we were at the beginning.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.960]   We have read so many books.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.080]   We have listened to so many lectures.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.960]   We have followed so many men.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.600]   But actually when we face ourselves and our living and life and our understanding and
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.760]   death and eternity, well we have got just to admit that we are exactly where we were
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   at the beginning.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.360]   We don't know any more.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   We haven't advanced a single step.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   We have been walking.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.600]   We have been traveling, certainly.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.240]   And we thought we had struck many a pathway that looked as if it was going to lead to
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.280]   a highway, but it didn't.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.120]   We are back again in a trackless waste.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:05.880]   We have gone round and round in circles.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.960]   But unfortunately it doesn't stop even at that.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.760]   Life goes on.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.960]   And it is no longer early morning with a bright shining sun.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   Noonday has passed.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.200]   Tea time has gone.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.480]   And the shadows of the night begin to appear.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.080]   And there is an ominous mist in the distance.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.280]   And we still haven't got a track.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.120]   We are not on any way that gives us any assurance of bringing us to a city.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.480]   And not only that, we begin to feel tired.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.120]   We have walked so much.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.540]   We have struggled so much.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.240]   There were certain brushwood we had to get out of the way in certain paths.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.060]   We were told that effort was necessary and we made it.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.360]   And we have tired ourselves.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.560]   And we are beginning to feel hungry, hungry and thirsty.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.000]   Their souls fainted within them.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.400]   You see we have passed middle age now.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.280]   We are beginning to get old.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.840]   And the night is coming on and the shadows are lengthening.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.320]   And our powers are feebler.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.360]   And somebody comes, "I have got a book, you read this, this will..."
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.840]   We say, "I am sorry.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.000]   I have read so many.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.480]   I have been told it so often.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.960]   Please don't bother me."
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.080]   We haven't got the energy to read any more books or to argue any longer.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.680]   It was marvelous fifty, sixty years ago.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.480]   But we can't do it any longer, hungry and thirsty.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.280]   Their souls were melting as it were within them.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.440]   Their souls fainted in them.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:54.280]   And here they are drawing ever nearer and nearer to the end, distressed and at last
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.680]   feeling even desperate.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.480]   At the end of a long life, exactly where we were at the beginning, only this that we are
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.320]   no longer young and we have lost our resilience and our capacity to recover.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.520]   And we have lost faith and we have lost hope and elasticity.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.200]   And we are failing and we are going down and we are drooping.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.400]   And we are hungry and we are thirsty and our knees are tottering.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.120]   And the end is coming and the night is falling.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:31.320]   And we are going out of the world and we don't know where.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:39.760]   Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.200]   And amazing statement.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:53.720]   And He delivered them out of their distresses.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:00.280]   You know my friends, I am almost tempted to pronounce the benediction at this point.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.840]   Because that is the whole thing, the whole story, the whole gospel.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:09.880]   It is just that.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:16.840]   But there may be someone who feels, yes, that is a marvellous picture, but is it true?
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.000]   What are you really teaching?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   What are you saying?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.040]   Well, let me put it to you in the form of propositions now.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.120]   I have given it as a picture.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.760]   Let me now put it in the form of principles, propositions.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.640]   Here is the first.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.240]   The teaching of the Bible from beginning to end is this.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:41.560]   That there is no way in life, there is no truth about life, apart from the Lord Jesus
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   Christ.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.600]   That is why I read to you that portion from the 14th of John at the beginning.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.760]   I would rather like you to keep in your minds as we consider this picture in Psalm 107,
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.920]   4-9, John 14, 6.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.760]   They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.960]   They found no city to dwell in.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.680]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.360]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.120]   That is the answer.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.640]   But let me work it out for you.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.960]   There it is as a bold proposition.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:25.560]   There is no way, there is no truth in this world apart from Christ.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.600]   Now that is not a dogmatic assertion.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.800]   That is something that I can prove to you.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:39.620]   And I can prove it to you out of the mouths of men who do not believe the Bible.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.440]   I can prove it to you out of the mouths of humanists.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.080]   That is the popular word today, isn't it?
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.160]   Humanists.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.400]   Scientific humanism, I am told, is the thing today, the thing that is rarely going to bring
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.080]   me to the city of habitation.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.960]   Well, very well, when I am told that, I always go to the best and to the highest authorities
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.640]   I can find.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.360]   I don't know of any greater scientific humanist in this country today, or perhaps in the world,
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.800]   than Dr. Julian Huxley.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   And what does he tell us?
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.800]   Well he tells us this, that his studies and his researches have brought him to this conclusion,
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:34.240]   that there is no design, that there is no meaning, that there is no purpose, that there
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.160]   is no end in life.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.640]   It is all accidental.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.640]   It is all a matter of chance.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.200]   You never know what is going to happen next.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.960]   There are what he calls sports, biological sports, that means just this, that certain
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.200]   things are thrown up now and again, nobody knows why nor how.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.160]   There is no sense nor rhyme nor reason in it, it just happens.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.880]   He says there is no purpose in creation, there is no purpose in life whatsoever.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.180]   You can't predict, you can't prophesy the future, you can't tell whether mankind is
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.960]   going up or going down.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.160]   It may appear at times to up, then the whole thing may suddenly be smashed.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.080]   There is nothing in it he doesn't know.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.480]   Is that the way to come to the city of habitation?
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.440]   That's the voice of scientific humanism speaking.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   But let us turn for a moment to the voice of classical humanism.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:45.240]   Classical humanism means this, that after all the key to life and the understanding
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.880]   of life is to be found in the teaching of the great philosophers of the past.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:58.800]   We are starting with the great Greek pagan philosophers, none of whom were Christians,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.440]   of course, and most of their followers have not been either.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.520]   That is the meaning of classical humanism.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:11.080]   You go back and study this accumulated wisdom of the ages and of the centuries, the great
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   literature of the world, and as you do so you will be given the wisdom that you need
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.920]   in life and in this world.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   Follow that.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:25.800]   Well, very well, let's again go to the greatest authority of all in this connection, and that
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.880]   is none other than Professor Gilbert Murray of Oxford, who is not a Christian and says
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:40.280]   so, a great man, a great brain, a great classical scholar and philosopher.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.800]   But what does he tell us?
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:49.480]   Well, he was honest enough to admit and confess in the last war that that war had shaken him.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.280]   He didn't understand mankind.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.720]   He didn't understand why man didn't apply this knowledge, but he saw clearly that mankind
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.920]   was not applying the knowledge.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   And what does he offer us?
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.800]   He still tells us to go back to something that has been there so long, but which is
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.280]   not leading people to this satisfaction.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   It fails.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.880]   It doesn't succeed.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:18.760]   Coming greatly down the scale, if you want more popular exponents of these views, no
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:25.960]   man ever stood more for this kind of thing I am describing than the late H.G. Wells.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:32.720]   But you remember his last book, his very last book of all, he gave it this significant title,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.960]   Mind at the End of its Tether.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.920]   He didn't know where he was.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.580]   The man who had preached so much throughout his life and who said he knew ends by saying
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.440]   he doesn't know, and he didn't.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.840]   I haven't wearied you with exact quotations, but if you don't take my word for it, well,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.680]   at the risk of being misunderstood, I advise you to read these men and you'll find it.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:10.560]   I think the most horrible and horrid description of man and of life that I've ever read was
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:18.320]   a description of life by Bertrand Russell, who again is utterly hopeless about it all,
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.360]   hopeless about the present, much more hopeless about the future.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:28.480]   Sees nothing there at all except blackness and darkness engulfing us, and the only thing
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.920]   he can be pleased about is that he believes that when we do go out of this world, that's
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   the end of it all.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.720]   It's just ceasing to exist.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.080]   And in a sense, he almost thanks God that that is what's going to happen, but he doesn't
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:47.920]   believe in God, so he doesn't thank him.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:55.160]   But it's sheer hopelessness, it's final despair.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.880]   They don't know, these greatest leaders and writers, they're baffled, they're bewildered,
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.860]   they don't know, they don't understand, and let me say this for them, they're honest enough
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:11.200]   to say so.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.840]   But as there is no way and no truth apart from Christ, there is no life apart from him
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.520]   either, and no hope and no satisfaction.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.360]   Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted within them.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   Yes, but when you come to him, to Christ, you read this, "He satisfieth the longing
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.200]   soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness."
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.440]   There is no satisfaction apart from him, there is no hope apart from him.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:43.280]   Again, I'm not simply making dogmatic assertions, I can prove it.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.640]   And if you want my proof, I simply tell you to go and read the autobiographies and the
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:54.000]   biographies of great men who have not been Christians.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.280]   Quite a number have been written recently.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.520]   I know of nothing more hopeless.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.940]   I hope you don't misunderstand me, there was a great man called Lord Simon, who was once
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:12.200]   the Lord Chancellor of England, he wrote his autobiography not long before he died.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.680]   Read it, my friend, if you want to see the hopelessness of a man who trusts only to intellect
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.360]   and who doesn't believe in God and who doesn't know the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.040]   Poor man.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.280]   He is trying to be happy by looking back at his great legal successes and the heyday of
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   his life.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.040]   Don't misunderstand me, I'm not criticizing these men, I'm simply giving facts and I'm
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.200]   simply saying that I'm sorry for them.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:47.960]   They don't know and at the end they go out into blackness and darkness and despair.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:54.160]   Do you know the end of the life story of Charles Darwin?
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.480]   Charles Darwin turned his back upon God and the belief in God and gave himself to pure
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.800]   scientific research because he believed that therein he would find the problem solved and
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.120]   the solution to all these difficulties.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.840]   And do you know, poor Darwin, this is in his official biography, at the end of his life
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:23.760]   he found that he'd lost his appreciation for poetry, for music, and even for a glorious
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   landscape.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.920]   Oh, what a narrowing of the soul.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.200]   Oh, what a fettering of a life.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.160]   What an atrophy of faculties.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:41.720]   A man who used to be able to enjoy poetry and enjoy music and enjoy the glories of nature
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.920]   and of creation, he has lost his appreciation.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:53.000]   His soul is shriveled, it's dwindled into nothing.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   But shall I summarize it by putting it in some words that I'm fond of quoting because
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.760]   it seems to me oftentimes to be the most perfect expression of the hopelessness of life without
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:13.800]   Christ, the words of Walter Savage Lambert, "I strove with none, for none was worth
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.240]   my strife."
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.160]   You see the cynical, "I strove with none, for none was worth my strife."
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.360]   Nature I love.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.800]   And next to nature, art.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:33.720]   You see the intellectualist, he loves nature and he loves art, sculpture, paintings, music.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:39.960]   Literature, anything that is artistic.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.120]   Nature I loved and next to nature, art.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   And he had a marvelous time.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:51.560]   He lived this full intellectual life.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.120]   I fought with none, for none was worth my strife.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.840]   Nature I loved and next to nature, art.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:05.960]   I warmed both hands before the fire of life and oh how enjoyable and warm and enriching
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.000]   it was.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.120]   I warmed both hands before the fire of life.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   It sinks.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   While I'm looking at it, the fire's going out.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   The fuel's ended.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   I've poked it.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   I've blown it.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   It's going out.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   It sinks.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.480]   And what about it?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.000]   And I am ready to depart.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   There's nothing left.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   It's going.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   It's leaving me.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.640]   And I'm left alone and I can do nothing about it.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.920]   I have nothing to look forward to.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   I'm going out.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.760]   There's the end.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.960]   Life without Christ is utterly hopeless.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.200]   There is no way.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   There is no path.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   There is no life.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   There is no truth.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.920]   It's a wilderness, a solitary way.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:54.040]   And it leaves us helpless and hopeless and lost and hungry and thirsty and our souls
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:40:00.120]   fainting within us.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:06.960]   But my dear friend, there is no need to go out like that.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:13.600]   I am the way, the truth and the life.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:20.280]   They cried out unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   Listen.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:29.480]   He led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.320]   That's it.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:41.640]   And he satisfieth the longing soul and feedeth the hungry soul with good things.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.280]   Christ is the way, the truth, the life.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.880]   Ah, but you say we no longer believe in that.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.440]   That's in the realm of folklore.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:41:06.720]   My dear friends, isn't it rather amazing that anybody should still go on saying that?
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:14.040]   The newspapers must be tragically short of news to go on repeating something that has
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.240]   been said so often.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:24.080]   Any fool in a bar parlor in London tonight is saying that he's always said it.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.880]   There's nothing new in saying that there's no God and that Christ is a myth.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:37.520]   I remember a poor old man being converted at the age of seventy-seven.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.440]   And his greatest trouble in his life from there on was that thirty years before in a
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:51.760]   drunken argument and brawl he had said, "Jesus Christ is a bastard."
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:58.320]   But he wasn't given press publicity for saying it, but he said what's being said.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:05.040]   I confess I don't quite understand the mentality of this modern world we're living in.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.960]   I read a psalm in the Old Testament which says this, "The fool hath said in his heart
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.240]   there is no God."
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.880]   Have we advanced beyond that?
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.800]   Of course we haven't.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.880]   It's simply a dogmatic assertion with no proof whatsoever.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.960]   It's simply repeating things which cannot be proved in any way at all.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.480]   It doesn't take into consideration for a moment the order and the arrangement in the
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   cosmos.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.440]   It doesn't take into account human history.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.880]   It doesn't take into account the fact of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.680]   What I don't quite understand about these people is why they speak of 1955 if they really
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   believe what they say.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   Why do they call it 1955?
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.600]   Why do they adopt that chronology?
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.880]   Look here, if you're to be scientific you know you mustn't do that sort of thing.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.240]   If you don't believe that Christ has ever lived, why do you speak of 1955?
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   It's rubbish, it's nonsense.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.120]   You're dwelling on a folklore and you're repeating it day by day and it's very wrong
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.600]   of you to tell your children that this is January 16, 1955.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:23.480]   You mustn't tell them fables and fairy tales.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.800]   I almost apologize for having said all that.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.880]   Oh, it's pathetic, it's tragic.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.640]   Shall I say another thing that may surprise you much more?
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.440]   The people who do harm to Christianity are not those people.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   We don't expect anything better from them.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.280]   The fool will go on saying in his heart there is no God.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.040]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.160]   The Bible has prepared us for all this.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.200]   It says the natural men cannot, don't expect him to, and don't be surprised when he doesn't.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.640]   They don't do any harm.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.200]   I don't expect unbelievers to glory in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   They've never seen him, they don't know him.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.800]   They're blinded by the God of this world.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.760]   That doesn't trouble me at all.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.600]   The real harm is done by people who call themselves Christians and who are members and sometimes
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:26.280]   ministers in the Christian church, but who deny the miraculous and the virgin birth and
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   the supernatural.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:33.080]   They are the people that do the harm.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.560]   Very well, my friend, he is the answer, he is the way.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:44.240]   Yes, he leads them by the right way, which means this, a straight way.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   And what does that mean?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.160]   Well, it means this, thank God, it's direct and simple.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.520]   It's the right way, it is the straight way, it's direct and simple.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.240]   This is how the Old Testament puts it.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:06.320]   The way to truth that Christ has opened is a way of which it can be said that the way
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.000]   faring men though a fool need not err therein.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.640]   Did you notice how Paul put that?
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.680]   He said, "Not many wise, not many noble are called."
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.000]   Thank God, here is a way, a way that brings me to the city of truth, and I don't need
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.240]   to be a philosopher.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.520]   I don't need to have been through the universities.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.320]   You see, if that's the way, well, then those people who haven't had a secondary and a
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.160]   university education are doomed and damned.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.440]   But here is a way that anybody can walk through.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   Why?
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   It means following a person.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:47.400]   It's a simple way, it's a direct way, it's a way for fools, it's a way for ignoramuses,
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.720]   it's a way for people who failed, it's a way for people whose very brain has become
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:59.600]   befuddled by drink and vice, it's a way that is prepared by God inside us and outside us.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:08.760]   It's a direct way, it's a straight way, it's a simple way, it's God's way.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   What's it mean?
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.680]   Well, it means just this.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.400]   Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:23.360]   Yes, he leads us by a straight and a direct way, in this way.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.880]   The gospel is so gloriously simple and direct, you see, it tells us at once that there's
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.320]   only one question that we need to consider.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.560]   You needn't read all these great books on philosophy because there's only one problem,
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.800]   and that is man's relationship to God.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.600]   It goes straight to the center.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.840]   It says that's the thing, it's the only problem in all people, whether you're an intellectualist
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.560]   or whether you're as dull as a person can be, it doesn't matter, it's the same problem.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:59.280]   You're not rightly related to God and your life won't be right until God begins to bless
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   you.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:07.360]   The need, the quest is only that of knowing God and getting to him.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:18.280]   "Thou hast made us for thyself," said one of the greatest philosophers of all, Augustine,
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.120]   afterwards of Hippo.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.280]   "Thou hast made us for thyself."
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.160]   He tried philosophy, but yes, while he was a philosopher, he was immoral and kept his
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   mistress.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.640]   No, no, he was in the wilderness, he didn't know at last he saw it.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:38.880]   "Thou hast made us for thyself, and our souls are restless until they find their rest in
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   thee."
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.680]   And he found it.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.880]   And he found it in Jesus Christ.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.840]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into this world in order to make a way from man to God.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:04.560]   He came into the wilderness and he charted it and he mapped out a road and he made it.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.040]   How do you know how he's made it?
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.960]   Well, he's made a road like this.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:12.200]   He's put his own body down and we step over it.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.160]   He laid down his life, his body.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.440]   It was broken, his blood was shed.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.680]   The bread and the wine remind us of it and as it were we walk over his broken body and
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:31.720]   he's shed blood, but it's a glorious highway and it brings us to God.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.560]   In all our need and helplessness and failure, when we come to him and see him and the truth
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:45.000]   as it is in him, we find that we are brought to God and God takes hold of us and gives
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.440]   us a new life and a new nature and everything we need.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.480]   It's a right way, it's a straight way, and I must just mention the other word as
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.920]   I close, it's a satisfactory way.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:07.120]   He satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.760]   He gives us complete satisfaction.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.800]   Yes, intellectual satisfaction.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.680]   I know of no problem tonight but that the Bible gives me an answer to it.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.480]   I mean what I say.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:33.160]   I find complete intellectual satisfaction here.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.880]   And I don't care what aspect of life you're concerned about.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.360]   I can demonstrate it to you.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:49.680]   A new view of life, a new outlook, a new explanation of my origin and beginning and that of the
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.400]   world and understanding of time, it's all here.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:03.280]   Man, sin, failure, all explained.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:10.360]   Surely it gives me satisfaction, my sin forgiven, strength and guidance and power, the operation
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:17.600]   of the Holy Spirit within me, a new view of sin and a new desire after holiness placed
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.640]   within me.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:30.920]   And whatever circumstances and situation I may find myself in, it helps me to understand
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.040]   it and to explain it.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.880]   All things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.520]   All things.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.240]   I understand illness in a new way.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.520]   I understand disappointment in a new way.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.640]   I understand death in a new way.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.280]   Everything is made new.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.520]   All things are passed away.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:05.080]   Behold, all things are become new all the way.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.440]   My Savior leads me.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.480]   What shall I ask beside?
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:16.760]   Can I doubt his tender mercy who through life has been my guide?
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:24.640]   Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, here by faith in him to dwell.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.400]   For I know what error befalls me.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:38.280]   Jesus doeth all things well.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.000]   Where are you, my friend?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.720]   That's the question.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.840]   Have you been merely an auditor as I've been speaking, a mere spectator?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:55.960]   Or have you realized that I've been speaking about you?
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.120]   Where are you?
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.720]   Are you still in that wilderness, wandering backwards and forwards, seeking, trying, hoping,
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   longing?
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:11.640]   Are the shadows beginning to lengthen?
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.280]   Do you know something of the despair and the hopelessness?
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:22.480]   Oh, if you do, I am privileged to say just this to you.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:27.720]   Cry out unto the Lord in your trouble.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:33.320]   And as certainly as you do so, he will deliver you out of your distresses.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.680]   I am happy to say this.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.000]   If you're young, well, take it from me now.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Don't waste your time.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.360]   You'll end where you began.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.120]   Turn to him now.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:49.840]   You may have already felt the despair.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:55.800]   Because despair is not confined to old age.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.960]   Young people can break their hearts, and they do.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.240]   Turn to him now, therefore.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.280]   Yes, but I'm equally glad to say this.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.240]   It isn't only for young people.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.000]   You may have one foot in the grave.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:21.000]   If you realize your loss, cry out to him in your trouble, even now.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.440]   And he will assure you that though you've wasted valuable, precious years, and though
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.080]   you've denied him and mocked him and laughed at him and scoffed at him, and though you
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:38.280]   may have been guilty of every sin known to men, and are bespattered and besmirched and
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:46.400]   howled by the mire of this world, he won't refuse you.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.640]   He will listen to you.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.280]   He will receive you now.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:57.920]   And he will tell you that he sent his Son into the world to die for you and your sins,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:03.040]   that he therefore forgives you in him and will take you unto himself and make you his
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:09.040]   child and lead you into his own glorious presence.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.920]   So turn to him even now.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.320]   Amen.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
