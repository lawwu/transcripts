[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060]   - There's no picture of Jordan on the wall.
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.100]   You're not listening to YouTube inspiration video.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.600]   Those would be all your voice anyway.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.220]   (laughs)
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.240]   You're not listening to your top 10 favorite songs
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.860]   just to get rolling and then lace the shoes, hit the books.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.060]   It's all in here.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.900]   - All in there.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.500]   I used to do that when I was fat, Rocky.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.020]   I mean, people know that that was my thing.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.620]   Round 14 was my thing.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.340]   And as I got older and older and older,
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.280]   that started to go away.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.140]   And I started to create,
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.100]   I had all these people that I used to watch.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.300]   Rocky was one, Barnes, Elias from Platoon,
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.060]   Jack from A Few Good Men.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.380]   You know, he's on the stand going crazy.
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.980]   I saw a lot of these characters that I looked at
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.660]   and I was like, man, I ain't got none of that.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.900]   But they were characters.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.140]   After a while, I lived a life so disciplined
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.660]   that everybody that I once looked to,
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.580]   these fake characters, I built that as a man.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.500]   And when I was younger, I had this image in my mind
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.520]   of what does a man look like to me?
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.460]   And I got all these people who were bad-ass characters.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.460]   And in my mind, I became that.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.860]   And that's what kept me going a lot,
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.500]   was I had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.520]   and a little bit of that.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.940]   'Cause when you have no parents raising you
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.020]   and you have no role models growing up,
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.680]   it's not daydreaming.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.780]   You start to create a reality like, hmm,
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.280]   maybe I can be that.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.040]   And after becoming this guy,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.620]   that is the biggest thing I can ever do in my life
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.700]   is I became that guy.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.460]   That I once looked at all these guys,
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.620]   now look at myself like, God, who the fuck can do that?
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.020]   I can.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.220]   But what it takes is a discipline
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.980]   that no one can ever even...
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.260]   They don't understand it.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.100]   They don't understand.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.300]   Everybody has the ability to do it,
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.500]   but they just don't want to.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.900]   They wanna keep asking questions
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.140]   and keep going to seminars.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140]   And the greatness is right in you.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.420]   And that's why, once again,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.000]   I'll say this a million times here,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.440]   I do not feel sorry for you.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.920]   I will not sugar coat what I'm going to say to you
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.940]   because all of you know what I'm saying is the truth.
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.200]   Everybody knows it's the truth.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.040]   This is what it looks like.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.360]   And you know it too.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.680]   You know it too.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.800]   If you ain't got nothing,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.320]   I hate to tell you what it looks like is ugly.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.360]   It's not a documentary.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.840]   It's not an HBO special.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.680]   You ain't gonna watch it.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.720]   But hey, man, you guys gotta watch this.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.120]   No, it's like, oh God, this looks like a train wreck.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.960]   It's like a nightmare.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.640]   It's like this guy got, no, it's what it looks like.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.960]   Hard work looks horrible.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.620]   It's not motivating.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.320]   It's not motivating at all.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.760]   It ain't like "Rocky" round 14
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.600]   where he gets knocked down
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.720]   and he goes like this to Apollo Creed.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.640]   It looks like a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.140]   and there's no fucking way out.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.620]   But you had the fucking key.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.660]   But you refused to use it.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.160]   And that's nothing motivating about that.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.320]   So yes, no documentary on David Goggins.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.380]   you
