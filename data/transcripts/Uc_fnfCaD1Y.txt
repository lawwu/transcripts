[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.180]   Isaiah 12, verses 5 and 6 says, sing praises to the Lord,
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.720]   for he has done gloriously.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.540]   Let this be made known in all the earth, shout.

[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.280]   For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.

[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:45.260]   >> Lord, we come to you out of great need, knowing that we are not what we ought to be.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260]   But Jesus is our only plea.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260]   My hope is only Jesus.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.260]   He is all that we are not.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:10.260]   I pray that you would fasten our eyes upon him and grant that we would receive from his fullness grace upon grace.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   Amen.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.260]   Well, it is a joy and a privilege to be with you here at Shepherds Conference,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:25.260]   gathered around the theme of proclaiming Christ to the ends of the earth.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260]   That's what we do, isn't it, brothers?
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260]   We preach Christ.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:38.260]   His glory is worthy to be proclaimed throughout the nations.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:44.260]   And so we gather to exhort one another and to equip one another
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:50.260]   to put the glory of Christ's person and work on display
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   to every tribe and tongue and people and nation in every corner of the earth.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:08.260]   And this morning I want to proclaim Christ to you here in this corner of the earth.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:15.260]   So please turn in your Bibles to the Gospel of John and chapter 1.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:26.260]   John wastes no time in displaying the Lord Jesus to us in the fullness of his glory.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:32.260]   His prologue, the first 18 verses of chapter 1 of his Gospel,
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:39.260]   is a wondrous introduction to the person and work of our Savior.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:45.260]   John ravishes us with the richness of his beauty
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.260]   as he dives in at the deep end of the theological pool.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.260]   John introduces us to him as the Word.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:01.260]   He co-ops the extremely pregnant Greek term logos,
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:09.260]   not only to identify Christ with what the Greeks thought was the supreme ordering principle of the universe,
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:17.260]   but also to identify Jesus as the supreme revelation of God the Father to mankind,
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:23.260]   the pinnacle self-expression of God to man.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:30.260]   In the first five verses of the prologue, John introduces us to the divine Word.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:38.260]   He is the eternal God, distinct from the Father, yet consubstantial with the Father,
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.260]   with God, and yet God himself.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:54.260]   He is the creator of all things, the self-existent fountain of all life and being.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:20:03.260]   He is the light of all men, the only hope of those who walk in darkness.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:09.260]   And he is the victor over darkness, who triumphed over all the forces of darkness
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:17.260]   when he condemned sin by his death and conquered death by his resurrection.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.260]   And then, as if John couldn't bear to speak of the glory of this divine Word
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:27.260]   without introducing us to the one who would proclaim that glory,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:33.260]   in verses six to eight, John introduces us to the Word and his witness.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:39.260]   And John the Baptist serves as something of a prototype of all Christ's people
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.260]   who are tasked with proclaiming his glory throughout the earth,
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:51.260]   testifying to the truths of his person and work on behalf of sinners.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:58.260]   And then, verses nine to thirteen, speak about the Word in his world.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.260]   John declares that the true light has come into the world
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.260]   and that the world has responded in one of two ways.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:15.260]   Sinners either disbelieve him and reject him and continue to walk in darkness
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   or God shines spiritual light and life into their hearts
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.260]   and raises them from spiritual death in the new birth
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.260]   and grants them the gift of saving faith in this Word.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:40.260]   And to those who receive him by faith, the Word himself sovereignly grants the right
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:48.260]   for those believers to become the adopted sons and daughters of Almighty God.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:55.260]   And then, in this majestic mountain peak verse of verse fourteen,
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.260]   John displays the glory of the incarnate Word.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.260]   He tells us that the divine Word became flesh,
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:10.260]   that the eternal second person of the Trinity took on a full and true human nature
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:16.260]   into personal union with the unchanging divine nature.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.260]   John tells us that in Jesus, the eternal, infinite God
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:30.260]   tabernacles among sinners and is himself the nexus of God's fellowship with man.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.260]   The eternally begotten Son, he says, the only begotten from the Father,
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:43.260]   is the one by whom spiritual orphans are adopted as sons
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.260]   because they are made to see his glory.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.260]   And he is full of grace and truth, saving us by his grace
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.260]   and guiding us in the light of his truth.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.260]   And so we have the divine Word in verses one to five,
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.260]   the Word and his witness in verses six to eight,
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.260]   the Word in his world, verses nine to thirteen,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.260]   and the incarnate Word in verse fourteen.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:20.260]   Now, in verses fifteen to eighteen, John fixes our eyes upon the excellent Word.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:27.260]   The excellent Word. Let's read John 1, 15 to 18.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.260]   John testified about him and cried out, saying,
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:37.260]   "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.260]   for he existed before me.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:47.260]   For of his fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.260]   For the law was given through Moses.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.260]   Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.260]   No one has seen God at any time.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:03.260]   The only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father,
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.260]   he has explained him."
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   John closes his prologue by speaking of how this eternal Word made flesh
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.260]   excels and surpasses all others,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   even the greatest and most significant figures of redemptive history.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:29.260]   Who is the Christ that we proclaim to the ends of the earth?
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.260]   He is the excellent Word.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   And I want to proclaim him to you this morning
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   as you prepare to proclaim him to the ends of the earth.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.260]   In John 1, 15 to 18, we find four excellencies
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:50.260]   that set the Lord Jesus Christ far above anyone and anything.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.260]   Four excellencies that exalt the glory of our Savior,
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.260]   that feed our faith, and that strengthen our souls
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.260]   to declare his excellency through all the nations.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.260]   In the first place, this excellent Word
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.260]   surpasses the greatest man who ever lived.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.260]   He surpasses the greatest man who ever lived.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.260]   Look at verse 15.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.260]   "John, that is John the Baptist, testified about him
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   and cried out saying, 'This was he of whom I said,
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.260]   'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I,
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:30.260]   for he existed before me.'"
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.260]   The Apostle John quotes the words of John the Baptist
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   exactly as he said them in John 1, 30.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:44.260]   And he testifies to the supremacy of Christ.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.260]   "He who comes after me has a higher rank than I."
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.260]   Or some translations have, "He has surpassed me."
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.260]   Jesus was born six months after his cousin John,
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.260]   according to Luke 1, 26.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.260]   And, of course, Jesus began his ministry
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:05.260]   after John had already began to be engaged in his.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.260]   And theirs was a society in which,
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.260]   as one commentator put it,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:17.260]   "age and precedence bestowed peculiar honor."
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.260]   That's why in the case of Jacob and Esau,
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.260]   it was such a scandal for God to tell Rachel
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.260]   that the older shall serve the younger.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:32.260]   Chronological priority meant superiority.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.260]   But John says Jesus, who comes after him,
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:42.260]   has surpassed him, has come to outrank him.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:49.260]   Literally it's, "He who comes after me has become before me."
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.260]   John says, "He is the king.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.260]   I am just the forerunner who announces the king's coming.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.260]   He is the bridegroom.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   I'm just the friend of the bridegroom
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.260]   who rejoices to hear his voice.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.260]   I'm the lamp who, for a little while,
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.260]   lit up the path where you should walk.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:17.260]   But that path leads to him who is the light of the world.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.260]   I baptize in water, but he who comes after me
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.260]   baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:32.260]   And I'm not worthy to untie his sandals."
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.260]   Remember who's speaking.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.260]   In Matthew 11:11, Jesus says,
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.260]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, among those born of women,
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.260]   there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist."
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.260]   Jesus himself, the eternal word,
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.260]   the light of the world, God the Son,
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.260]   is saying John the Baptist is the greatest man who ever lived.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.260]   Why?
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.260]   Because God chose him to perform the most important task
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.260]   to that point in human history,
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:10.260]   to be the forerunner of the Messiah.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.260]   He was the last of the Old Testament prophets,
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.260]   even as Jesus says in Luke 16:16,
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:25.260]   "The law and the prophets were precursors of the new covenant."
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.260]   He himself was the pivot point of all biblical history.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.260]   So the greatest man who ever lived up until that point
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.260]   was John the Baptist.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.260]   And John himself says,
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.260]   "This one who comes after me has surpassed me.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.260]   He's come to outrank me.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.260]   He has excelled me in every way."
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.260]   He said, "I'm the greatest?"
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.260]   Well, he is greater than the greatest then.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.260]   And why is that?
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.260]   What is the ground of Jesus' supremacy over John the Baptist?
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.260]   Why does he surpass the greatest man who ever lived?
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.260]   Look at it again.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.260]   "He who comes after me has come to be before me
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.260]   for he existed before me."
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:18.260]   Literally because he was before me.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.260]   And this is that famous being versus becoming contrast
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   that John is so fond of throughout his prologue.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.260]   The contrast between "A me," the verb "to be,"
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.260]   and "ginamai," the verb "to become."
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:37.260]   He has become or come to be before me
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   because he was before me.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.260]   He comes after me because according to his humanity
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.260]   he was born after I was and began his ministry
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   after I began mine.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.260]   But he was before me because according to his deity
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:30:00.260]   he is the uncreated, eternal God of heaven and earth.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.260]   He was before me.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.260]   He has been existing from eternity.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.260]   John 8:58, Jesus says it himself,
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:14.260]   "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.260]   The apostle Paul says in Colossians 1:17,
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:23.260]   "He is before all things."
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.260]   Matthew 3:1 says, "Now in those days John the Baptist came.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.260]   Paraginamai came along."
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:40.260]   But Micah 5:2, "His goings forth are from the days of eternity."
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.260]   John says, "I am of yesterday.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.260]   He is from eternity."
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.260]   Yes, my father prophesied over me at my birth, Luke 1:76,
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:56.260]   that I would be the prophet of the Most High.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.260]   But the angel Gabriel promised to Mary, Luke 1:32,
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:05.260]   that he would be the son of the Most High.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.260]   I am and am honored to be a minister of the new covenant,
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:18.260]   a herald of the dawning of the new covenant.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:23.260]   Hebrews 9:15, "His blood is the blood of the new covenant."
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:29.260]   Hebrews 13:20, "This is the one of whom I spoke."
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.260]   Brothers, this is the one of whom we speak,
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:41.260]   the one who surpasses the greatest man who ever lived.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:46.260]   That brings us to a second excellency of this excellent word.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.260]   I'm going to break the rules here and skip verse 16
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.260]   and come back to it at the end.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.260]   We've seen Christ's supremacy over the greatest of the prophets in verse 15.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.260]   We come to see Christ's supremacy over the lawgiver in verse 17.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   Number two, Christ supersedes the glorious mediator of the old covenant.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:15.260]   Christ supersedes the glorious mediator of the old covenant.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   Verse 17, "For the law was given through Moses.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:26.260]   Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ."
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.260]   Now, the law was a wonderful gift from God to his people.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:38.260]   It was a gracious gift for God to reveal his mind to his people,
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:46.260]   to direct our steps, to guide our path into the path of blessing.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.260]   That's why Psalm 119.29 says, "Remove the false way from me
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:58.260]   and graciously grant me your law."
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:03.260]   The law of God is the delight of the child of God.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.260]   David says, "Oh, how I love your law.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.260]   It is my meditation all the day.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:21.260]   The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces."
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.260]   The law was given through Moses.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   How? How was it given?
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.260]   It was given in glory.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.260]   2 Corinthians 3.7 says, "The ministry of death in letters engraved on stones
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.260]   came with glory so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:44.260]   because of the glory of his face."
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.260]   Aside from the fact that at the giving of the Mosaic Law,
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:53.260]   Mount Sinai was covered in smoke and Yahweh descended on it in fire,
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.260]   that there was thunder and lightning and the mountain quaked,
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.260]   and that the glory cloud covered the mountain for six days.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.260]   Aside from all of that, when Moses went up to the mountain to speak with God
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.260]   from the sheer reality of being in the holy presence of God himself,
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:14.260]   Moses' own face shone with the radiance of God's glory.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:21.260]   So much so that he had to put a veil over his face so as not to terrify the people.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:30.260]   This was a glorious ministry with a glorious mediator, literally.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   In fact, in Numbers 12, verses 6-8, God says,
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.260]   "If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, shall make myself known to him in a vision.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.260]   I shall speak with him in a dream.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.260]   Not so with my servant Moses.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.260]   He is faithful in all my household.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.260]   With him I speak mouth to mouth, even openly, and not in dark sayings.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:55.260]   And he beholds the form of Yahweh."
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   God speaks to Moses, literally the text is, mouth to mouth.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.260]   We might say, face to face.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.260]   God even says, "Moses beholds the form of Yahweh."
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.260]   We're going to hear in a moment, we've already heard in the past addresses,
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:13.260]   that no one has seen God at any time.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.260]   But here we're told that Moses beholds the form of God.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.260]   It's unbelievable.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:27.260]   The mediator of the old covenant was glorious.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:35.260]   But John's point in verse 17 is the same as Paul's point back in 2 Corinthians 3, verses 7-11.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.260]   "If the ministry of death and letters engraved on stones came with glory,
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   so that the sons of Israel couldn't look intently at the face of Moses
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.260]   because of the glory of his face fading, though it was,
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:54.260]   how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory?
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.260]   For if the ministry of condemnation has glory,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:02.260]   much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory."
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.260]   Paul says, "Indeed, what had glory in this case has no glory
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   because of the glory that surpasses it.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:18.260]   For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory."
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:23.260]   The ministry of condemnation was glorious.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:30.260]   The Israelites beheld the glory of God himself reflected on the face of Moses.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:36.260]   But Moses couldn't justify his people.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.260]   Why?
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.260]   Because when the law confronts sinful human nature
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.260]   that fails to meet its standard of perfection,
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.260]   it pronounces upon us a sentence of death.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.260]   The law can't change hearts.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:00.260]   It could never provide the power for the obedience that it demanded.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.260]   For that, only the grace of the new covenant would suffice.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.260]   Galatians 3.22, "But the scripture has shut up everyone under sin
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.260]   so that the promise," that is the new covenant promise,
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:19.260]   "by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   Galatians 3.24, "Therefore the law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   so that we may be justified by faith in Christ's works,
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.260]   not by the doing of our own works."
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:41.260]   The law points to the need for grace.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   But grace comes in the person and work of Jesus
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.260]   who has instituted the new covenant,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.260]   whose great promise is what?
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.260]   "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.260]   I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.260]   Those who believe in the name of Jesus, John 1.13,
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.260]   have been born of God.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.260]   Their hearts of stone have been transformed
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:16.260]   and brought to life by the grace of regeneration.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:22.260]   Moses was not the mediator of a ministry of righteousness.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:29.260]   Oh, but the Lord Jesus Christ, friends, He can justify His people.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.260]   Hebrews 8.6, "Christ has obtained a more excellent ministry
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:42.260]   which has been enacted on better promises."
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.260]   The glory of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth,
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.260]   the one in whom grace and truth are realized,
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.260]   His glory supersedes and far outshines
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:01.260]   even the glory of Moses in the old covenant.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:06.260]   The glory of the law revealed in the face of Moses
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:14.260]   is no match for the glory of God revealed in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:20.260]   As one preacher puts it, "Moses points to grace, but Jesus performs grace."
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:25.260]   Moses reports the words of God. Jesus is the Word of God.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:32.260]   The law mirrors the light of God. Jesus is the light of God.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:37.260]   And as the author of Hebrews put it, Hebrews 3, 5-6,
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:44.260]   "Now Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.260]   for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:54.260]   But Christ was faithful as a son over his house."
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.260]   Moses was a faithful servant, but Christ was a faithful son.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:06.260]   This excellent Word supersedes the glory of the glorious mediator of the old covenant.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:13.260]   He far excels Him. He outshines Him.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:20.260]   And that brings us to a third excellency of this excellent Word, number three.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.260]   He shows the glory of the unseen Father.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.260]   He shows the glory of the unseen Father.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.260]   Verse 18, "No one has seen God at any time.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:41.260]   The only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him."
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:49.260]   No one has seen God at any time. He is, Colossians 1, 15, the invisible God.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:56.260]   He is, Hebrews 11, 27, "Him who is unseen."
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.260]   In 1 Timothy 6, 15-16, Paul says,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.260]   "The blessed and only sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:09.260]   is the one who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light,
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.260]   whom no man has seen or can see."
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:21.260]   Seeing God does not only not happen, it's impossible.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:26.260]   But what about texts like Numbers 12, 8, which says, "Moses, behold the form of Yahweh,"
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:31.260]   or Exodus 33, 11, which says, "Yahweh used to speak to Moses face to face,
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.260]   just as a man speaks to his friend."
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:41.260]   Well, these have to be figures of speech that signify a special closeness.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.260]   Moses did not see God in His essence,
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:51.260]   precisely because these categorical statements of God's invisibility preclude that possibility.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:56.260]   In fact, while Exodus 33, 11 says, "Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face,"
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.260]   just nine verses later, in Exodus 33, 20, we heard it last hour,
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:08.260]   God tells Moses, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live."
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.260]   So it's plain, it's figurative language.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:18.260]   But John's reference to Moses in verse 17, and then God's invisibility in verse 18,
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.260]   is pointing us to Exodus 33.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.260]   Moses prays that God would show him His glory, and God says in verse 22,
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:31.260]   "I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I've passed by.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:38.260]   Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen."
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   And, of course, because God is spirit and does not have a body,
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.260]   He does not literally have a back or a face.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.260]   It's the Shekinah glory of God that Moses sees,
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:56.260]   a physical, visible manifestation of God's presence, His back, if you will.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:02.260]   But the actual, infinite, incomprehensible essence of God, what He calls His face,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   not even Moses can see that.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:15.260]   But this excellent word, "He has seen God."
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.260]   John 6:46, Jesus says, "Not that anyone has seen the Father,
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:25.260]   except the one who is from God."
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.260]   God has seen the Father.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:35.260]   Why? John 1:18, "Because He is the only begotten God."
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.260]   John uses the same word as he does in verse 14, monogamous,
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.260]   which is, rightly translated, "only begotten."
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.260]   It's a reference to the doctrine of the eternal generation of the Son.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:54.260]   What it means for God the Son to be Son is that He is eternally begotten from the Father.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.260]   Just as a son bears the same nature as his father,
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.260]   and yet has that nature from his father,
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.260]   so also the eternal Son is consubstantial with the Father,
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:14.260]   having the identical nature that the Father does, but having it from the Father.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:22.260]   And so to call Him the only begotten God is to identify Him as the eternal divine Son.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:27.260]   To speak of the only begotten God is to speak of God the only begotten,
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.260]   or God the Son.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:37.260]   And who is more likely to know the Father than His Son,
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.260]   the one who subsists in the identical nature?
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:46.260]   When the Father acts, He acts by the principle of the divine nature.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.260]   When the Son acts, He acts by that very same divine nature.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.260]   If the Father is saying or thinking or doing anything,
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:01.260]   the Son is right there with Him, subsisting in the identical essence.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   Matthew 11, 27, Jesus says, "No one knows the Son except the Father,
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.260]   nor does anyone know the Father except the Son."
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   The eternal divine Son knows the Father in such comprehensive intimacy
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   that compared to that knowledge, no one else knows the Father at all.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.260]   And still further, back to John 1, 18,
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:36.260]   this only begotten homoousios Son is in the bosom of the Father.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:42.260]   To be in someone's bosom is to be the object of their special and tender love.
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:49.260]   The King James translation of Deuteronomy 13, 6 speaks of "the wife of thy bosom."
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.260]   The NAS translates that "the wife you cherish."
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:58.260]   So to be in someone's bosom is to be cherished.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.260]   John is saying that there is a closeness between the Father and His only begotten Son
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:10.260]   that surpasses even that of the one who beheld God's glory on Mount Sinai.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:16.260]   Jesus stands in the closest possible relation to the Father
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:21.260]   in His bosom from all eternity.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:27.260]   But also, to be in someone's bosom meant to be privy to their most secret thoughts.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:32.260]   The idea is that the things that we keep to ourselves we hide in our hearts.
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:38.260]   And so Calvin observed, "The breast is the seat of counsel."
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.260]   To be in the bosom of the Father is to say, as Matthew Henry put it,
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.260]   "Christ was privy to the bosom counsels of the Father."
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:50.260]   The prophet sat down at His feet as scholars.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.260]   Christ lay in His bosom as a friend.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.260]   The only begotten Son knows the Father's mind
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:05.260]   because the Father's mind is the self-same mind as the Son's mind.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:12.260]   And the beloved Son knows the Father's mind because He is in His bosom,
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:18.260]   aware of the most hidden and unseen counsels of His heart.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.260]   Which means what?
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:26.260]   That He is the most qualified one that there can be
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:31.260]   to reveal the God that no one has seen at any time.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:36.260]   The infinite, incomprehensible God whose gracious revelations of Himself
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:43.260]   in His Word and in His world are only the fringes of His ways, Job says.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   Matthew 11, 27, again, "No one knows the Father except the Son
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:54.260]   and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.260]   Jesus is the revelation of God.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:04.260]   The revelation of the God who would otherwise remain unknown to men.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:09.260]   "He has explained Him," verse 18.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:15.260]   "Exegeomai," the word from which we get our term "exegesis,"
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:21.260]   which means to read out of a text as opposed to reading into a text.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:26.260]   Jesus is the exegesis of God.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:31.260]   Which is to say this Jesus shows the glory of the unseen Father.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:37.260]   He is, Colossians 1, 15, the image of the invisible God.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:44.260]   He is, Hebrews 1, 3, the exact representation of His nature.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:49.260]   This is not a fading reflection of the Shekinah glory on the face of Moses.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   As marvelous as that was, this is, 2 Corinthians 4, 4,
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:49:00.260]   the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:07.260]   This is, 2 Corinthians 4, 6, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.260]   Moses caught a glimpse of the back of God's glory.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:18.260]   Jesus is the embodiment of the fullness of God's glory.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:25.260]   And so Jesus Himself can say to Philip in John 14, 9, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father."
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:31.260]   Not because Jesus is the Father, but because Jesus is everything that the Father is.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.260]   Because He is in the Father and the Father is in Him.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:40.260]   Because the only begotten Son of the Father is of the same nature as the Father.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:48.260]   He is the perfect, visible exposition of the invisible Father.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.260]   No one can see My face and live.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:58.260]   In Christ, brothers, we behold the face of God and can do nothing but live.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:03.260]   Nothing but rise from the dead because everyone who beholds the Son
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:11.260]   and believes in Him will be raised up by Him on the last day, John 6, 40.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:17.260]   If you want to know what the unseen Father is like, you look at Jesus.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.260]   He is God incarnate.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:27.260]   He is the Word of God, the ultimate and pinnacle self-expression of God.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:33.260]   And so in John 2, when you see Jesus turn water into wine,
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.260]   you can know that God is the omnipotent Lord of all creation.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:44.260]   When you see Jesus make a whip and overturn tables in the temple,
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:50.260]   you can know that God is holy and that He hates blasphemy
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:54.260]   and He desires to be worshipped in spirit and in truth.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:59.260]   And when you see Jesus go out of His way to meet the Samaritan woman at the well in chapter 4,
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:05.260]   you know that God seeks and saves that which was lost.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:11.260]   When you see Jesus heal the nobleman's son and the lame man at the pool of Bethesda,
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.260]   or when you see Him feed the thousands who followed Him,
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.260]   grieved because they had nothing to eat,
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:23.260]   you can know that God is a God of compassion on sinners.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:29.260]   When you see Him silence the mob ready to stone the woman caught in adultery,
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:35.260]   you can know that God delights to forgive the worst of sinners.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:40.260]   When you see Him weeping over Mary and Martha's grief,
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.260]   you can know that God hates sin
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:50.260]   and that He cares for His children who've grown under sin's curse.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:56.260]   When you see Him, the Lord and the Teacher, washing the disciples' feet,
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:01.260]   you can know that God loves His unworthy servants
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:08.260]   and delights to serve them as an expression of His overflowing fullness.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:20.260]   And when you see Him betrayed and arrested and bound and interrogated and disowned
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:34.260]   and crowned with thorns and mocked and slapped in the face and condemned and crucified,
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:43.260]   you can know the breadth and the length and the height and the depth of the love of God
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:47.260]   for hell-deserving criminals like you and me,
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:53.260]   a love that surpasses knowledge.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   And when you see Him risen from the grave and ascending into heaven
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:05.260]   and seated in the heavenly places far above all rule and authority,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.260]   you can know that God has conquered sin and death
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:15.260]   and rules the world in uncontested majesty and sovereign blessedness
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:30.260]   and will keep His promises to bring every last one of His children safely home to Him.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   Now we come back to verse 16 to find a fourth excellency of this excellent word.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.260]   "He surpasses the greatest man who ever lived.
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.260]   He supersedes the glorious mediator of the old covenant.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.260]   He shows the glory of the unseen Father."
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:52.260]   Number four, "He supplies the grace sufficient for every sinner."
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:57.260]   "He supplies the grace sufficient for every sinner."
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:07.260]   Verse 16, "For of His fullness we have all received and grace upon grace."
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:14.260]   Verse 14, "Told us that this glorious one, only begotten from the Father, is full of grace and truth."
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:23.260]   And here John says, "Every one of us who belongs to Him by faith has received from His fullness."
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.260]   Oh, the fullness of Christ.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.260]   The fullness of our Savior.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:35.260]   In Ephesians 4.13, Paul speaks of the fullness of Christ.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   In Ephesians 3.19, he says, "Knowing the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:44.260]   fills believers up to all the fullness of God."
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:50.260]   Colossians 1.19 says, "It was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Christ."
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:55.260]   Fullness of grace.
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:55:01.260]   You and I, friends, we are spiritually empty.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.260]   We have fallen short of God's righteous standard of perfection.
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:13.260]   And there is nothing that we can do to satisfy divine justice but go to our everlasting misery.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:18.260]   We are spiritually destitute with no resources of our own to commend ourselves to God
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:21.260]   or to save ourselves from our just condemnation.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.260]   Oh, but here comes our Savior.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.260]   God the Son incarnate.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.260]   And He is full of grace.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:35.260]   He is full of unmerited favor to be bestowed upon poor sinners
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:39.260]   who could do nothing but go to their ruin.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:46.260]   There is no other way for the nations to fill the emptiness of their spiritual poverty
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:50.260]   except through faith in this one.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:57.260]   Calvin says, "As soon as we have departed from Christ, it is vain for us to seek a single drop of happiness
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.260]   because God has determined that whatever is good shall reside in Him alone.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:10.260]   Accordingly, we shall find angels and men to be dry, heaven to be empty, the earth to be unproductive,
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.260]   and, in short, all things to be of no value
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:20.260]   if we wish to be partakers of the gifts of God in any other way than through Christ."
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:25.260]   It is of His fullness that we all receive.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:31.260]   He and He alone is full of the grace upon grace that we so desperately need.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.260]   And so if we seek it anywhere but by faith in Him,
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:44.260]   we will find ourselves just as poor, just as destitute, just as bankrupt as we were when we began.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:50.260]   But in Him, dear brothers, drawing from His fullness,
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:56.260]   we will find the fountain of grace upon grace to be inexhaustible.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:02.260]   We will find that He supplies the grace sufficient for every sinner.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:07.260]   Matthew Henry wrote, "As the cistern receives water from the fullness of the fountain,
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:13.260]   the branches sap from the fullness of the root, and the air light from the fullness of the sun,
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:18.260]   so we receive grace from the fullness of Christ."
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:24.260]   He is an inexhaustible fountain, an ever-plenteous rich root,
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:29.260]   a superabundance of light from the sun.
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:34.260]   This is the testimony of every one of God's people.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.260]   We who have feasted upon this Savior by faith
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:43.260]   have received nothing but the gracious dispensations of a loving shepherd,
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:51.260]   nothing but grace upon grace, literally grace in place of grace.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.260]   What's that mean?
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:58:00.260]   It's just this never-ending supply of grace after grace after grace from Christ our dear Savior.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:08.260]   There is the grace of atonement, of a full and perfect redemption that rescues us from the wrath of God.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:14.260]   There is the grace of regeneration, the sovereign miracle of the Holy Spirit
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:20.260]   where He births in us who were dead the fullness of the divine life.
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.260]   And that gives way to the grace gifts of repentance and faith.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:29.260]   We turn in disgust from the filth and fruitlessness of sin,
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.260]   and we rest our souls upon the blood and righteousness of our perfect substitute.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:40.260]   And we're united to Him so that all that is His becomes ours.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.260]   And that's followed by the grace of justification
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:49.260]   by which we, guilty sinners, are justly declared righteous
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:54.260]   solely on the basis of the obedience of Jesus in our place,
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:59.260]   imputed to our account apart from any works of our own.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:05.260]   And then the grace of sanctification sets us apart to be God's own possession.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.260]   It frees us from the dominion of sin
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:15.260]   and then progressively transforms us into the very image of Christ Himself.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.260]   And the grace upon grace doesn't stop until glorification,
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:24.260]   when every trace of sin is eradicated from us,
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:32.260]   and we are raised to live in sinless freedom with the triune God forever.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:37.260]   John MacArthur says grace upon grace is like wave upon wave.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:41.260]   It's like waves of grace rolling in on the seashore.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.260]   When one wave of grace breaks onto the shore and then washes back out,
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:51.260]   there's just another wave right behind it with a fresh supply of grace.
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:55.260]   John Gill paraphrased it as "heaps of grace."
[00:59:55.260 --> 01:00:03.260]   It's just the language of abundance, of profusion, of limitlessness and boundlessness.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.260]   And friends, who needs grace upon grace?
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:10.260]   Sinners need grace upon grace.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:15.260]   And it's not just grace for regeneration and conversion and justification.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.260]   Praise God for those.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   But it's the ongoing grace, isn't it, of fresh pardon for sins.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:28.260]   We who have received such boundless grace in our conversion,
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.260]   I mean justified freely, adopted children of God,
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:41.260]   surely we, among all people, know better than to go on sinning against our Lord
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:48.260]   in our thoughts, in our words, and in our actions.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:01:01.260]   And yet we hate and we covet and we lust and we envy.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:10.260]   We complain and we gossip and we lie and deceive.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:20.260]   We manipulate, mistreat, sow dissension, and are lazy.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:30.260]   We commit idolatry as we worship the idols of our hearts above our great God and Savior.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.260]   God help us.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:43.260]   We prefer other lesser beauties over Him, the loveliest and most beautiful of all.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:52.260]   And we think that sinning so grievously against grace poured out so lavishly upon us
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.260]   disqualifies us from more grace.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   Our flesh, stirred up by the enemy of our souls, says to us,
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.260]   "How can you be a Christian when you still sin like this?"
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:11.260]   I mean, every day.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:20.260]   And we're tempted to think that ones so vile as we are need to spend time away from Christ.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.260]   We put ourselves in spiritual time out.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.260]   We make ourselves go sit in the spiritual corner until we can perform the penance
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:34.260]   of feeling bad enough about our sin.
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.260]   I'm not saying don't mourn over your sin.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.260]   Go and mourn over your sin.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.260]   Let repentance be heartfelt.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.260]   But know this Savior is full of grace.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:53.260]   And from His fullness we all receive ongoing present tense grace upon grace.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:57.260]   And so though our heads hang in shame, brothers, over committing the same sins
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:02.260]   against the same Lord who deserves better from His people,
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   nevertheless we go to Him every day, every hour for forgiveness.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.260]   We don't wait in the corner at a distance from Jesus
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:21.260]   until we can satisfy some sort of self-imposed standard of self-atonement.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:27.260]   We don't let our spiritual emptiness drive us away from His fullness.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:34.260]   The recognition of our bankruptcy propels us to flee unto Him
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:39.260]   where we may draw once again from the fullness of His grace.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:44.260]   And because He is full of grace, when we come to Him in repentance,
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:50.260]   we find nothing but a sympathetic high priest who loves to forgive.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:57.260]   And can you believe this, is not ashamed to call us brethren.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:01.260]   My little children, I'm writing these things to you so that you may not sin.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.260]   But if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father,
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.260]   Jesus Christ the righteous.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:15.260]   And if we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.260]   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:26.260]   You see, we can live upon this Christ who is so full of grace.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.260]   We never need to fear that we'll deplete His fullness.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:33.260]   You may draw grace from the fullness of that fountain
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:37.260]   and you will never exhaust His supply.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:44.260]   Our Savior is more full of grace than you are of sin.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.260]   There is more grace in Christ than there is sin in us.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:56.260]   More grace in Christ than sin in all of the members of His body.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:04.260]   There is deeper grace in Christ, friend, than there is sin deep inside your heart.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:13.260]   Even the deepest sins that you commit, the darkest sins that you keep hidden from others,
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:21.260]   there is no cavern of sin so deep in your soul that the grace of Christ is not deeper still.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:27.260]   And so you may come into the light in freedom because there's forgiveness within.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.260]   If only you come and draw from this fountain,
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:36.260]   you will find grace upon grace upon grace upon grace.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.260]   It's not as if your drawing from the well of grace that is in Christ
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:43.260]   somehow diminishes His supply of grace in any way,
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.260]   whether for you or your fellow believers.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:50.260]   His fullness of grace is like an ocean, again,
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:54.260]   that just keeps washing up grace onto the shores of your heart,
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.260]   wave after wave after wave.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:00.260]   And you have as much chance of exhausting Christ's grace
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:07.260]   as gathering up the Pacific Ocean a thimbleful at a time.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:15.260]   And in fact, so far from diminishing Him or bothering Him or annoying Him,
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:21.260]   when you fly to Him for fresh grace, you magnify His fullness.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:26.260]   You glorify Him as one who is so sufficient to supply your every need.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.260]   I mean, this is truly astounding.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.260]   Psalm 50, verse 15, God Himself urges His people,
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.260]   "Call upon Me in the day of trouble.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:41.260]   I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me."
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:47.260]   In other words, your calling upon Me in the midst of your trouble honors Me
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   by demonstrating that you believe that I am sufficient and strong enough
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.260]   to rescue you when you call.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.260]   Isn't that glorious?
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.260]   I mean, isn't it wonderful to worship a God who is honored
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.260]   by supplying to us what we lack?
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.260]   That's a good deal.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:13.260]   "Worship Me by being needy." Yes, Lord.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.260]   John Newton understood this.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:21.260]   He wrote a beautiful hymn called "For Mercies Countless as the Sands."
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:27.260]   And he's asking, "What can I give back to God for all these mercies I receive?"
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.260]   And at first he laments.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:35.260]   He says, "Alas, from such a heart as mine, what can I bring Him forth?
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.260]   My best is stained and dyed with sin.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:43.260]   My all is nothing worth."
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.260]   There's nothing I can give Him to show my thanks
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:51.260]   because everything I have is tainted with sin.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.260]   But later in the hymn, he recognizes that the best kind of worship
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:01.260]   from one so vile a sinner is to magnify God's sufficiency
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.260]   just by asking Him for more grace.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:13.260]   He says, "The best return for one like me, so wretched and so poor,
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:21.260]   is from His gifts to draw a plea and ask Him still for more."
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:27.260]   The best praise from unworthy sinners who need so much grace
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:36.260]   is to go to Him trusting that His fullness will supply even more grace.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.260]   What a Savior He is.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.260]   What an excellent, excellent Word He is.
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:46.260]   You may come and drink and drink and drink
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:50.260]   and you will never exhaust His supply.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:55.260]   If you are hungry, He tells you, "I am the bread of life.
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:59.260]   He who comes to Me will not hunger."
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.260]   If you are thirsty, He tells you, "If anyone is thirsty,
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   let him come to Me and drink.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:07.260]   The water that I will give him will become in him a well of water
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.260]   springing up to eternal life."
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:15.260]   If you're blind, He says to you, "I am the light of the world.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.260]   He who follows Me will not walk in the darkness,
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.260]   but will have the light of life."
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:26.260]   If you are lost, He tells you, "He is the good shepherd," John 10, 14,
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:29.260]   "who came to seek and save that which was lost,
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   who leaves the 99 in the open pasture
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:36.260]   and goes after the one of the lost until he finds it."
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:40.260]   If you are dead, He says to you as He said to Martha,
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.260]   "I am the resurrection and the life.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.260]   He who believes in Me will live even if he dies,
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:51.260]   and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die."
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:58.260]   Dear friends, this Jesus supplies the grace sufficient for every sinner.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:04.260]   As Sinclair Ferguson said, "He is more full of joy than you can be full of sorrow.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:08.260]   He is more full of light than you can be full of darkness.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.260]   He is more full of strength than you can be full of weakness.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:16.260]   And He is more full of life than you are of death.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:21.260]   Everything we could wish to have is in Him."
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.260]   This Jesus, brothers, this excellent Word,
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:30.260]   this is the Christ that we proclaim to the ends of the earth.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.260]   Bread for the hungry, water for the thirsty,
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:38.260]   light for the blind, healing for the sick, life for the dead.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.260]   We tell sinners in every nation of the world,
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:47.260]   "Your idols, friend, the things that you seek satisfaction from instead of Jesus,
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.260]   they do you no good.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:53.260]   They are of no profit to your soul.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:00.260]   Sure, there may be some certain fleshly pleasure in them for a moment,
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.260]   but it's only for a moment.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:08.260]   Your soul wasn't designed to be satisfied by drunkenness and drugs
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:15.260]   and fornication and adultery and money and power and fame and adulation
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.260]   or any of the rest of the false gods of this world."
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:22.260]   We tell them, "They don't satisfy."
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:29.260]   Which is why you have to go back to them again and again for your next fix.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.260]   Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:36.260]   but whoever drinks of the water that Jesus gives shall never thirst,
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:42.260]   because water from the fountain of the living waters satisfies.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:48.260]   Your soul is restless and in turmoil because you're seeking satisfaction in every place
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.260]   but in the one person you were created to find it in.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:58.260]   It's like filling your gas tank with olive oil and being frustrated that your car won't start.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.260]   Augustine put it well when he said, "You have made us for yourself, O Lord,
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:09.260]   and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.260]   And so, dear unbeliever, Christ calls you,
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:17.260]   "Come unto me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest."
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:21.260]   You will find rest for your souls.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:25.260]   Here is a Savior who has lived a perfectly righteous life,
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:31.260]   who has obeyed the very law of God that you have broken and by which you are condemned.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:36.260]   Here is a Savior who died the very death under the heavy hand of the wrath of God,
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.260]   which you deserve to die.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:44.260]   Here is a Savior who is risen from the dead in victory over sin and death
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:49.260]   that presently hold you in bondage, the sin and the death that have a grip on your soul.
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.260]   Here he is who can free you from these things,
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:56.260]   turn away from your sins, turn away from yourself,
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.260]   and put all your trust in your righteousness before God
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:03.260]   squarely upon the shoulders of Jesus alone.
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:12.260]   And if you do that, you will find all the fullness in him that we have found in him.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:16.260]   That's what you tell the world.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:20.260]   And then I say to you, my brothers and fellow ministers,
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.260]   who have come to him in repentance and faith,
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:27.260]   who have found rest under his easy yoke and light burden,
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:31.260]   dear friends, fly to Christ every day of your life.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.260]   Drink from that fountain.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.260]   Draw from that fullness.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.260]   Live upon the grace of Christ.
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:46.260]   And so fill your heart with satisfaction and joy and love
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:52.260]   that you seek it no more in sin, where it's not to be found,
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   but only in him, where it is full,
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:14:04.260]   where love and satisfaction and joy are full every morning.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:08.260]   The words of a 19th century hymn by a woman named Ora Rowan
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:13.260]   form a fitting conclusion for us this morning.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:19.260]   She writes, "Hast thou heard him, seen him, known him?
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.260]   Is not thine a captured heart?
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.260]   Chief among ten thousand, own him.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:30.260]   Joyful, choose the better part.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:35.260]   Captivated by his beauty, worthy tribute haste to bring.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.260]   Let his peerless worth constrain thee.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:43.260]   Crown him now unrivaled king."
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.260]   His peerless worth constrains us to crown him
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:53.260]   as the unrivaled king and lord of our lives.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.260]   She goes on.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:15:00.260]   "What has stripped the seeming beauty from the idols of the earth?
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:08.260]   Not a sense of right or duty, but the sight of peerless worth."
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.260]   You hear that?
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.260]   It's not the sense of mere rightness or duty
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.260]   that causes us to turn from our idols,
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.260]   that causes the nations, the pagans of the world,
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.260]   to turn from their idols.
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:24.260]   It's not merely the principle that it's wrong for us to worship these idols.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:29.260]   It's the sight of the peerless worth of the excellent word.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:35.260]   It's the sight of the word that excels all others.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.260]   And so she continues.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:43.260]   "'Tis that look that melted Peter.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:47.260]   'Tis that face that Stephen saw.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:55.260]   'Tis that heart that wept with Mary, can alone from idols draw.'"
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:16:00.260]   And then she finishes by calling us to drink from his fullness
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:05.260]   and be compelled by that fullness to faithful allegiance to him.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:13.260]   "Draw and win and fill completely, till the cup o'erflow the brim.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:20.260]   What have we to do with idols who have accompanied with him?"
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:25.260]   Let's pray.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:29.260]   O Lord Jesus,
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:35.260]   O that there were words that we could pour out from hearts as wicked as ours
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:40.260]   to extol your grace upon grace to us.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:46.260]   What have we to do with idols who have accompanied with you?
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:53.260]   We who have seen your peerless worth, we testified to it, we have seen it.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:57.260]   And yet we turn our eyes away from it.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:03.260]   And we allow ourselves to be allured by what is filthy,
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:06.260]   by what does us no profit.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.260]   O wretched men that we are.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.260]   But thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:20.260]   that there is now therefore no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.260]   And that justification seals us up for sanctification
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:30.260]   so that we can actually, practically put these things away in our lives
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:34.260]   and become more like you.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:38.260]   We are not what we ought to be.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:45.260]   But Lord, we trust in the grace of your Son.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.260]   And we pray that you would have pity on us
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.260]   and that you would, in zeal for the glory of your own name,
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:57.260]   pursue our sanctification
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:02.260]   with the same zeal that you regard for your own holiness.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:07.260]   That we might be ministers fit for the Master's use.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.260]   That we might see Christ on the path of obedience
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:15.260]   and fellowship with Him and commune with Him,
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.260]   who is the fountain of life.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:24.260]   So that we might live the pleasantest life that there is with Him.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:28.260]   And come to that great day and have no need to be ashamed.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.260]   No need to shrink back.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:36.260]   But to boast, as Newton said,
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:40.260]   that I've got nothing to give,
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:45.260]   but would I glory in the thought that I will owe Him the most.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:50.260]   That's what each of us feels.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:56.260]   God, would you use your word, by the power of your Spirit,
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:01.260]   to fasten us upon Christ and sanctify us.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:04.260]   Burn away the dross in our hearts.
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.260]   Make us spiritual men,
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:11.260]   so that you would be exalted among the nations.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:16.260]   We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:28.260]   [applause]
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:33.260]   Thank you, Mike, for that excellent opportunity
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:40.260]   for us to see how Christ can be exalted for your passion,
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:45.260]   for your clarity, and for your excellence.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.260]   Well, we have certainly -- where are you guys going?
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.260]   [laughter]
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.260]   Wait, wait, wait, I've got a lot of things to say here.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.260]   Come on, give me a second.
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.260]   Obviously, they're hungry, and it's okay.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.260]   We've just had our souls fed, so now it's time for our stomachs.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.260]   I get that.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.260]   You know, one of the biggest blessings we've had here
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.260]   at Grace Community Church started in the 1970s
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:05.260]   when the Lord placed an In-N-Out burger
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.260]   a half a mile down the street from our campus.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.260]   But now one of the best blessings
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   that Shepherds Conference has received is, as of today,
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.260]   the In-N-Out burger is just really 200 feet that way.
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.260]   And so we're going to go there in just a moment.
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:23.260]   You also need to know, 1969, when John MacArthur got here,
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:27.260]   Burt Michelson was already here, and he was making hot dogs.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:30.260]   And so you can also go to Burt's Famous Dogs
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   next to the north side of the book tent.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.260]   And if that's not enough, stop by the ice cream station
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.260]   and enjoy your ice cream with warm cookies
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.260]   or make an ice cream sandwich.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:44.260]   So look, life is uncertain, so have dessert first
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.260]   and then do everything else.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   But that's all for you.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.260]   Now, on a serious note,
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:54.260]   there are two special lunch seminars at 1 o'clock.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.260]   One, the pastor-theologian serving the church
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.260]   through faithful scholarship
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:02.260]   has moved to the tower building, the 370s room.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:05.260]   So just know that it's in the tower room, 370s,
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:08.260]   and the entrusted and entrusting
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:11.260]   how to raise up future elders in your congregation
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.260]   is still in the Family Center.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:18.260]   Also, many of you have asked about purchasing additional copies
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.260]   of the limited edition Shepherds Conference
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.260]   LSB MacArthur Study Bible.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:25.260]   Well, just after our dismissal,
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:28.260]   we will have a limited number for sale
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:31.260]   in the book tent at 50% off retail.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.260]   So visit the Thomas Nelson table
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.260]   and pick up a copy while it lasts there.
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.260]   And then just one more announcement, very important.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.260]   Please avoid parking on Roscoe Boulevard,
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.260]   otherwise your car will be towed.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.260]   And I was just informed that if your vehicle
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.260]   is parked in a red curb in the north lot,
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.260]   you're about to be towed.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.260]   So let's pray quickly.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.260]   [laughter]
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.260]   Father, bless this time of feasting and fellowship
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.260]   and allow the flavors we taste to remind each man
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.260]   of your great common grace to all men,
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.260]   grace that comes to us by your unrivaled goodness.
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.260]   In Christ we pray, amen.
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.260]   [silence]
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:22.260]   [silence]
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:32.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
