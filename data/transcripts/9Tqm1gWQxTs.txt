[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   - I love artificial intelligence,
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.400]   and I've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.900]   Space Odyssey, 2001, Space Odyssey.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.320]   Let me ask the question about Hal 9000.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.860]   That makes a few decisions there
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.240]   that prioritizes the mission over the astronauts.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.120]   Do you think, from a high philosophical question,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.520]   do you think Hal did the right thing
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.480]   of prioritizing the mission?
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.620]   - I think our artificial intelligence
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.520]   will be smarter in the future.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.040]   For a Mars mission, it's a great question,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.440]   that is the reality of it.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.200]   For a Mars mission, we need fully autonomous systems.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.520]   We will get humans, but they have to be fully autonomous,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.840]   and that's the most important concept,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.640]   because there's not gonna be a mission control on Earth.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.480]   20 minute time lag,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.680]   there's just no way you're gonna control it.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.760]   So fully autonomous,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.500]   so people have to be fully autonomous as well,
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.080]   but all of our systems as well.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.220]   And so that's the big design challenge.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.140]   So that's why we test them out on the moon as well,
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.800]   when we have a, okay, a few second,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.640]   three second time lag, you can test them out.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.180]   We have to really get autonomous exploration down.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.680]   You asked me earlier about Magellan,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920]   and Magellan and his crew, they left, right?
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.400]   They were autonomous.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.560]   They were autonomous, they left,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.880]   and they were on their own to figure out that mission.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700]   Then when they hit land, they have resources,
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.800]   that's in-situ resource utilization,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.840]   and everything else they brought with them.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.080]   So we have to, I think, have that mindset for exploration.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.080]   Again, back to the moon, it's more the testing ground,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.040]   the proving ground with technologies,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.420]   but when we get to Mars, it's so far away
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.440]   that we need fully autonomous systems.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.200]   So I think that's where, again, AI and autonomy come in,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.500]   a really robust autonomy,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.320]   things that we don't have today yet.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.720]   So they're on the drawing boards,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.160]   but we really need to test them out,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   'cause that's what we're up against.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.560]   - So fully autonomous, meaning like self-sufficient,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.160]   there's still a role for the human in that picture.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.600]   Do you think there'll be a time when AI systems,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200]   just beyond doing fully autonomous flight control,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.600]   will also help or even take mission decisions like Hal did?
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.440]   - That's interesting.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.480]   It depends, I mean, they're gonna be designed by humans.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.360]   I think, as you mentioned, humans are always in the loop.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   I mean, we might be on Earth, we might be in orbit on Mars,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.880]   maybe the systems, the landers down on the surface of Mars,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.240]   but I think we're gonna get, we are right now,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.920]   just on Earth-based systems, AI systems
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.320]   that are incredibly capable,
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.520]   and training them with all the data that we have now,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.560]   petabytes of data from Earth.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.080]   What I care about for the autonomy in AI right now,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.840]   how we're applying it in research,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.920]   is to look at Earth and look at climate systems.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.240]   I mean, that's the, it's not for Mars to me today.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   Right now, AI is to eyes on Earth,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.400]   all of our space data, compiling that using supercomputers,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.680]   because we have so much information and knowledge,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.120]   and we need to get that into people's hands.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.040]   We need, first, there's the educational issue
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.280]   with climate and our changing climate.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.440]   Then we need to change human behavior, that's the biggie.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.760]   So this next decade, it's urgent
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.200]   that we take care of our own spaceship,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400]   which is spaceship Earth.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.160]   So that's, to me, where my focus has been for AI systems,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.560]   using whatever's out there, kind of imagining, also,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.200]   what the future situation is.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.600]   What's the satellite imagery of Earth of the future?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.300]   If you can hold that in your hands,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.520]   that's gonna be really powerful.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.960]   Will that help people accelerate positive change for Earth,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   and for us to live in balance with Earth?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.760]   I hope so, and kind of start with the ocean systems.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   So oceans, the land, the air,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.140]   and kind of using all the space data.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.920]   So it's a huge role for artificial intelligence
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.000]   to help us analyze, I call it curating the data,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.240]   using the data.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.800]   It has a lot to do with visualizations as well.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
