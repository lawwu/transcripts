[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   Culture is so strong.
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.340]   It creates this what's right, maybe a miasma that you can't see outside.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.160]   I remember a guy I talked to who was a trader at Enron, really smart guy.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.220]   And he was like, after the, after the bankruptcy, he said, of course, if we're
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.000]   all getting paid based on creating reported earnings, and there's all this
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.900]   cash going out the door in order to do these deals that are creating reported
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.200]   earnings, and that's the culture of the entire firm, of course, it's
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.420]   not going to work economically.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.720]   He said, I never thought about it.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200]   It just didn't, it didn't, it didn't occur to me.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.800]   And I think the more compelling the CEO, the more likely you are to
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.900]   have that kind of mass delusion.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.000]   I mean, there's a reason cults exist, right?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.800]   We are as human beings, remarkably susceptible to, quote, visionary leaders.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.040]   It's just, it's the way the human brain is wired.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.360]   We, we want to believe, and especially if somebody has the ability to put a vision
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.960]   forward, like Jeff Skilling did at Enron, like Elizabeth Holmes did at
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   there are enough like SBF did.
