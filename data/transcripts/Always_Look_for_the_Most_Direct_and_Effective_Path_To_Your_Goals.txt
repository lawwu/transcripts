[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.760]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.780]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.780]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.780]   I am your host.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.860]   Today I'm going to talk to you about taking the easy path to your goals or rather taking
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.360]   the direct path to your goals.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.160]   I'm going to do this in the context though of a show that I have been wanting to do for
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.320]   a good number of months.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.440]   I'm going to introduce it by talking about taxes.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.400]   I wanted to wait a few months until this comment that I read on the internet would disappear
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.120]   so I wouldn't embarrass the person who wrote the comment originally.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.400]   But when I saw this comment, I immediately screenshotted this sucker and I have wanted
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.680]   to do this show since then.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.880]   So here's the comment.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.080]   This was posted online in a personal finance forum.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.080]   The commenter writes this.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.800]   Sorry, it was in a personal finance group on Facebook.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.840]   The commenter writes this.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.520]   Quick service announcement.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.800]   Thanks to the CARES Act that was recently signed into law, over-the-counter medication
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.640]   and feminine supplies are now HSA eligible.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840]   Retroactive to January 1, 2020.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.760]   Keep those receipts and don't forget to log that mileage.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.320]   And then the hashtag, sticking it to Uncle Sam.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.960]   Now, I don't know if this strikes you as funny as it does me, but to me, I sat there and
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.920]   cackled for several minutes when I read this post.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:43.800]   I just sat and cackled because I thought, "What a ridiculous juxtaposition of perspectives."
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.880]   The hashtag is what pushes it over the top.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.280]   Sticking it to Uncle Sam.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.760]   And I thought, "Okay, how much over-the-counter medication and feminine supplies are you going
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.120]   to actually be spending such that it's actually going to make a difference and you're going
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.320]   to stick it to Uncle Sam?"
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.120]   And I want to drive the lesson home here for you because it's important that you think
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.320]   about this stuff.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.360]   So let's just assume, I don't know how much you can pay in over-the-counter medical supplies,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.480]   but let's say you spend $20 per month on over-the-counter medications, Tylenol, Advil, something like
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   that.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.560]   And depending on, I don't know how much you spend on feminine hygiene supplies, but let's
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.400]   say you spend another $20 a month on feminine hygiene supplies.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.840]   So your total in a year is $480 of total deductions that you have.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.400]   Now, let's figure out how much this deduction is worth.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.680]   So what the commenter here is saying, remember that he's saying that thanks to the CARES
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.480]   Act that was recently signed into law, over-the-counter medication and feminine supplies are now HSA
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   eligible.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.360]   So what would it mean to fund a health savings account?
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.520]   Well, you can put pre-tax money into the health savings account.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.920]   And then if you take the money out and you spend it on qualified medical expenses, then
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.080]   you can pay the money without paying any income taxes on the money.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.720]   And then, so let's figure that out.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.000]   Well, it all depends on your tax rate, of course, but if you're HSA eligible, let's
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.080]   just assume you're paying an effective tax rate of let's make it 20%.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.960]   So that means that you're going to save $96 per year on your $480.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.920]   You'll save $96 of tax.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:36.960]   Now with an HSA, one of the nice things about an HSA is that if you have that with an employer
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.640]   where you can do an automatic payroll deduction into the HSA, then you can fund that prior
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.080]   to employment taxes as well.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.200]   So that would be 7.65% in the United States.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.720]   So $480, 7.65% would be $36.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.120]   So you're possibly at 36 plus 96, you're possibly at $132 of savings.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.400]   Now the reason why I didn't want to do this show soon when I saw the screen check, didn't
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.380]   want this to be searchable, I don't want to embarrass anybody, is on the one hand, I have
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.880]   a profound amount of admiration for somebody who is detail-oriented like this and who is
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.520]   willing to understand these details and who's willing to dig into stuff.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   I appreciate that.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.760]   That's a good character quality that someone is saying, "Okay, I'm going to use an HSA
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.400]   and now I'm going to save my receipts for feminine hygiene supplies and over-the-counter
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   medication."
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   Great.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.440]   But on the other hand, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.160]   That was a generous, when I said $40 a month between over-the-counter medication and feminine
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.640]   hygiene supplies.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   That's generous and you have a total savings of potentially a hundred and something dollars.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.400]   It's just not that big a deal.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.960]   And what I fear, because I've done this many times myself, what I fear is that somebody
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:19.600]   in this situation genuinely does use the hashtag, sticking it to Uncle Sam in a non-ironic fashion.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.320]   Now if it were used in an ironic fashion, right, "Ha ha, there's this tiny little savings
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.360]   and I'm sticking it to Uncle Sam," it's funny, right?
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.800]   But I kind of got the sense that it wasn't being used here in an ironic fashion.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.320]   There's no way to know from the context.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.640]   It just seemed like it was a serious thing and I thought, "This is bad.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.800]   This is dangerous."
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.000]   Because if you think you're getting more from your actions than you are, you wind up putting
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.480]   yourself in a tough spot because you're not doing anything that is actually effective.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:00.760]   Now I don't intend this to sound arrogant or bragging in some way, but last week, you
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.720]   know, tax day in the United States was extended out from April 15th to July 15th due to the
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   coronavirus pandemic.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.760]   And so last week I finished doing my taxes, submitted my return, and for 2019 I legally
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.080]   paid $0 of federal income tax, including $0 of employment tax.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.680]   And that was awesome.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.360]   Followed every law and just simply by leaving the United States and going abroad, I legally
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.640]   cut my tax bill to $0.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.480]   Now that's something that certainly there were a lot of expenses associated with my
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   doing it.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.120]   It wasn't an easy process.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.800]   My tax forms were an absolute bear to fill out, utterly overwhelming to work through
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   all of those.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.920]   So it was not easy, but it was extraordinarily effective.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   And it was quite gratifying.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:07:01.120]   It was very, very gratifying for me to send in that return to the IRS with $0 of tax liability.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.160]   And I thought, and I've had this tweet in the back of my hand, I'm like, "That's sticking
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.080]   at Uncle Sam.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   Just leave.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   Don't play his game.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.680]   Don't, you know, that's sticking it to Uncle Sam.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.600]   Actually just stop."
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:22.640]   Now I'm not trying to advocate vigorously that everybody has to do what I have described.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   I'm not.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.000]   I understand that there are many good reasons not to do that.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And I hope that you have enough respect for my own self-awareness to know that if you,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.560]   I'm not trying to, wouldn't tell you what to do.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:41.000]   But what I saw in it was I saw a very clear lesson that a lot of times you can just walk
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.440]   away from all the stuff.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.960]   Now I have studied tax planning for a very long time.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.920]   And this is an epiphany for me.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.080]   I've been interested in taxation for a very long time.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.800]   I've studied the topic extensively.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.440]   I've read book after book after book.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   I mean, just last week I caught up, I spent the last few days catching up on all of my
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.800]   continuing education credits for my certified financial planner designation and a bunch
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.840]   of other, you know, my CLU and CHFC.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.560]   I got behind on my CE and I just, I went out of compliance on all that stuff.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.720]   And I decided to go ahead and bring it back into compliance.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.760]   So I needed to do 61 hours of CE.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.420]   And so I did 61 hours of CE.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.960]   But I'll tell you the courses that I did.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.860]   I did small business tax planning.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:34.000]   So I read a 550 page book on small business tax planning and I took 120 page exam on it.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.160]   I did a course on divorce tax planning and that one was a 315 page book and took an exam
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   on that.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.520]   I did a course on financial planning tax strategies.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   That was a 350 page book and, you know, another course.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.120]   I did a course on asset protection tax strategies.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.060]   You might be noticing something of a theme here, right?
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.540]   That was an almost 400 page book and an exam.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.760]   And so with those four courses, I was able to get my, that plus one other, I was able
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.640]   to get my 61 hours of CE done.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:16.020]   But as I was doing it, I've come to the point where as I go through all this stuff and you
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:22.460]   spend all your time going through these tiny little details, like my friend here who writes
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.240]   that you can now deduct over-the-counter medication and feminine supplies, and you read these
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   crazy rules and I love this stuff.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   I want to make that clear.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.440]   Like I love this stuff.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.160]   One of the things that I was finally able to find in one of these courses was I was
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.060]   finally able to find the IRS regulations of how you can take a company vehicle and basically
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.600]   bulletproof your company vehicle use as being almost 100% without the need to keep mileage
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.800]   logs and all these modifications you can do to your pickup truck and turn it into that.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.040]   I was like, I was thrilled to find that.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.440]   I'm like, yes, I got another tool in my arsenal.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.560]   Here's how I can teach somebody to be more bulletproof.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.600]   The whole time I'm thinking about how utterly stupid this entire system is and how I am
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.680]   wasted dozens of hours.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.180]   Now that I'm outside the United States, doing my US taxes is not simple or easy at all because
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.400]   of my offshore corporations.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.720]   It's not simple and easy at all.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.960]   It's one of the forms that I did, the 5471.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.320]   The IRS estimates I think it's a 32-hour form is their estimate.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.000]   I went through the thing and it's mind-boggling.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.080]   I'm sitting here saying, "This is such a waste of time."
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.480]   I'm calculating how much time do we waste on this every single year?
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.080]   It's an insane system.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.960]   I cannot think of anybody who would actually sit down and design this system and think
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.040]   that it actually made sense.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.800]   Just the rules upon rules upon rules upon rules upon rules.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.120]   It's a crazy system.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:02.520]   Over the years I've just thought, "It's crazy.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.480]   It's a crazy system."
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.720]   And yet the pathway through it is fairly simple.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.160]   It's the simplest pathway if you want to be done with most of that stuff, not all of it
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.020]   if you're a US citizen because of course as a US citizen you have the other insane system
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.140]   where the US government never lets you leave until you officially renounce your citizenship.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.040]   They follow you all over the world, make you report everything that you do.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.640]   It's just another utterly horrific system.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   But what else is new?
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.480]   But the simplest solution in most cases is just simply leave.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.240]   If you leave everything changes.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   I thought over the years and especially over the last couple of weeks as I've done all
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.360]   this tax stuff and I've been planning to do this show on this funny little thing I saw
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.680]   online.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.040]   I just thought, "Isn't that the story of my life?"
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:12:00.080]   Because the reason why that comment strikes me so much, public service announcement, you
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.360]   know, "Thanks to the CARES Act, over-the-counter medication and feminine supplies are now HSA
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   eligible.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.920]   Keep those receipts and don't forget to log that mileage, sticking it to Uncle Sam."
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   The reason why that comment resonates with me so much is because that's me.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.720]   That's the kind of stuff that I would do.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.840]   And that's the kind of stuff that I have wasted years of my life doing.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:32.400]   Doing these piddly little detail-oriented things that appeal to my OCD, weird tiny little
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:40.760]   detail-oriented mind and yet give you just crap for results.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.000]   Absolute crap for results.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.840]   I mean, the time required to properly log your receipts for over-the-counter medication
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.160]   and feminine supplies is stupid.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.680]   Just like the vast majority of the time that you do piling up all your records, just complying
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.520]   with all of the requirements of the IRS to have your records and books in order, it's
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.760]   just, it's asinine.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   It's stupid.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.680]   It's such a waste of time.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.920]   It's stupid.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.960]   And what happens is that energy sucks you down and keeps you from doing something that
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.440]   actually is going to grow something.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.760]   This guy who wrote this comment, I'm sure he's a smart guy, but if he took the time
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:28.680]   that he spends in tracking his receipts for over-the-counter medication and feminine supplies
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.760]   so that he can store those up for his HSA, if he put that into making a little bit of
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:38.840]   money or developing a skill or adding something on, the return on investment would generally
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.200]   I can't imagine be a lot higher.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.760]   Now you can make the detail argument, right?
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.720]   You can say, "Oh, it's not that much, Joshua.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   Come on.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.080]   You check out on two things, keep the separate receipt, plop it in.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.320]   It doesn't have to be that much."
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.520]   And you're right.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   You're right.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.760]   And that's why I said I admire somebody who is careful with the details.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.120]   I don't want to be loose with my language.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.920]   But there's a personality trait that I have, right, and that this guy has that causes you
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.460]   to spend so much time sucked down in the details that you miss the forest for the trees.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.400]   You miss the big path.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.200]   And for me, that's revelatory, right?
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.520]   Instead of complying with all the craziness of the thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.180]   of pages of IRS codes where it's just not possible.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.080]   It's not even possible to understand it, let alone do it.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.360]   And so you know, you feel every time, you know, I sent that document off.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.280]   When I do my taxes, I just assume this is going to be leaked.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.720]   It's going to be on the internet.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.320]   And you know, here I am, I talk about the stuff public, it's going to be on the internet.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.440]   I'm going to face an auditor and everything's going to be published on the internet.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.880]   So let me do it.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.960]   And so I had this like intense pressure when I fill that stuff out, like to get it exactly
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.440]   right, because I know it's going to be ripped to shreds by somebody.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.880]   And yet I feel utterly incompetent doing it.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.880]   And you know, sometimes you wish you were blissfully ignorant.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   It's easier for other people to be blissfully ignorant.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.120]   But in theory, I should know what I'm doing in theory, and I feel utterly incompetent
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.760]   filling those forms out.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.920]   I'm not sure anybody doesn't feel incompetent myself.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.040]   Even the, you know, the full-time tax lawyers.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   It's so complex.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.160]   It's a simple, obvious solution is just leave, walk away.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.360]   And you can do that in most places.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:40.640]   And what I have experienced with doing that, I have experienced this tremendous burst of
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   energy.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:48.400]   Now, I like to make the intellectual argument that there's no 100% tax rate.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.920]   People think about, is there a point in time at which it makes sense for me to do less
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.480]   with regard to taxes?
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.920]   And the answer is no.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.720]   Even in a high tax country like the United States, you know, you can get up, if you're
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.560]   living in California or New York City, you can get up to over half your income, right?
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.280]   50, 55% depending, you know, you're dealing with the investment tax, you're dealing, how's
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.320]   your income structured?
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.920]   You can get up to that 50% number.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.880]   It's not easy, but you can get up to that 50% number and higher.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.760]   And so you say, well, there's no 100% tax rate.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.040]   That's true.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   There's not.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.720]   But what I have found is just knowing that I was out of the system to a high degree by
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.240]   leaving the United States brought me just this incredible freedom and willingness to
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   make more money.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.280]   Now, I don't know if that's unique to me just because I get bent out of shape over stuff.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.520]   A lot of people seem a lot less uptight about taxes than me.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   They just go with it.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.880]   No big deal, you know, pay my fair share and go on.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.800]   I admire that mentality.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.960]   I think it's a healthier mentality probably than my uptightedness, but I still struggle
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   with it.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.480]   And just being free of it has been like this incredible boon to my brain and to my willingness
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.760]   to earn more and do more and make more.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:10.200]   But it's much more effective to go for the big wins first.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.280]   Now, I just want to draw the lesson out with some other examples because over the years
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:21.880]   I've done quite a lot of financial planning for people, I've realized that in some ways
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:30.960]   what I get paid for is simply taking something that's obvious and saying it to somebody.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.160]   Taking something that's obvious and saying it to them.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.040]   I was reminded of this yesterday.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:43.360]   I saw a tweet from a friend of mine on Twitter, Brent @TheFoodTruckCEO, and he wrote this.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.720]   He said, "I always thought I wanted to retire early.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.560]   Turns out I just wanted to get out from my soul-sucking corporate job.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.200]   Financial independence will always be a focus, but retirement is the last thing on my mind.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.020]   Make sure you're aiming at the right target."
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.920]   My answer to him was, "Me too."
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.560]   Because in a lot of ways that was my experience.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.800]   I remember that when I was in jobs that weren't a good fit for me, that was when I got super
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.160]   interested in the early retirement financial independence movement because I saw it as
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.240]   the way out.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:20.040]   And it was only when I got forced to actually sit down and do the analysis and I realized,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   you know what?
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.240]   I don't actually want retirement.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.040]   I just want to get out of that.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.360]   I want to go to something else.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.960]   And so many times I see that as the solution, and I've made that a central focus of radical
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.560]   personal finance because it's meant so much to me.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.200]   If I don't want to – it's not that I need to go through this long-winded pathway
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   of spending years and years and years living like a miser and saving.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.120]   I just need to change my job.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.880]   And if I can change my job from something that's not such a good fit for me to something
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.840]   that's a better fit for me, that solves the majority of the problems.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.640]   You know, Brett left the corporate world and he started a pizza business as a pizza trailer,
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.400]   a food trailer, and he goes around and makes pizza for it.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   He does great at it.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.340]   He's super into it, does a really good job at it.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.160]   And that's been the kind of thing that I've often thought, you know, I would do that.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.560]   I always joke with my wife, we have a long list of businesses.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.720]   If I go broke, I'm going to do this.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.240]   If I go broke, I'm going to do that.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.800]   And when I think about going back to the corporate environment versus running a barbecue truck
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.680]   or running a pizza truck or something like that, I would love the barbecue truck, would
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   love the pizza truck.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   And I think a lot of people would.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.000]   I wouldn't dread the work.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.680]   It doesn't have anything like the leverage of other kinds of businesses in terms of total
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:38.040]   earning power, but it's still, it's very meaningful, really enjoyable work for the right personality
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.480]   type.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:45.360]   And so I point it out to you because you may not need to go through this long-winded process,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.320]   sorry, long process.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.840]   You may not need to live on 20% of your income for 10 years so you can retire.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   You may just need to go get another job.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.320]   You may not need to save millions of dollars so that you can finally afford to buy that
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.440]   house in Florida.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.040]   You might just need to get out of New York City and go anywhere else and get another
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   job.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.160]   You may not need the college degree.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.800]   You may just need the certification over here.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.160]   You may just need to read this book.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.800]   You know, I've been re-reading one of my favorite books.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.160]   It's called The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   It's a great book, wonderful book.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.000]   And Josh, I'm re-reading it.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   He wrote it in English.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.680]   I'm re-reading it in French to work on my French skills.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.240]   And Josh wrote that book.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.440]   And it just, because it's like, what's the point of going and taking an MBA if I just
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.760]   read some books and did what was in them that would make a much bigger difference?
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.720]   And that was his story when he wrote the book.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.600]   He was working at a big job.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   He started reading.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   He started publishing a blog.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.320]   He sent one email to Seth Godin.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.120]   Seth Godin published a link to his blog on Seth's site and the rest was history.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.920]   And he learned and applied and then he became basically financially independent and he's
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.000]   been a full-time dad virtually for the last few years doing very little in the business
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.600]   world because of his success in a very short period of time.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.360]   Again and again and again I see this played out in almost everything.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.520]   And my encouragement to you is that you sit down and take the time to do the analysis
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   of how do I solve this problem in the most efficient way.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:26.960]   This is an area where I'm skilled and unskilled simultaneously because I'm skilled at often
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.760]   seeing the solution, but I'm often unskilled in doing it.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.400]   Most things are really simple.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.860]   Most things are really simple.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:43.160]   And the people who often do the best are often those who are not the smartest, but who just
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.440]   simply do something.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.840]   Almost every business has these elegantly simple solutions.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.640]   I remember when I was in sales, I studied sales.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.080]   And the simplest way to increase your income in sales, know what it is?
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.480]   Let's say you're making $100,000 a year.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.760]   You want to increase your income as a salesperson.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.880]   The simplest and most direct path for you to double your income from $100,000 a year
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:14.520]   to $200,000 a year is to double the time that you spend face to face or talking to prospects
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.900]   and clients.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.960]   The simplest thing that you can possibly do is simply increase the amount of time that
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.180]   you spend talking to people.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.920]   It's actually one of the things where I think, although I haven't heard, some of you are
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   financial advisors.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.320]   I think the coronavirus epidemic is going to turn out to be a huge blessing for you.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.960]   Because what it's forced is it's forced people to stop relying on driving all over the town
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   and doing everything face to face, but rather to get good at doing things online.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.080]   When I started in the business years ago, I would drive all over town, drive here, drive
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   there.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.880]   Then I got better and I got people coming to my office.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.040]   But then I started doing a lot of stuff digitally and it made all the world of difference.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.680]   Because you can go back to back and you can do eight, 10 meetings in a day, hour, just
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.200]   back them up.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.440]   That radically transforms things because it allows you to spend a lot more time face to
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.920]   face with prospects and clients, which has a direct impact on your business.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.360]   Very simple metric, but yet incredibly effective.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.320]   Most businesses have these simple metrics.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.840]   Most lives have these simple things that you can look at and say, "If I just change this
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.320]   one thing, it'll radically transform basically everything."
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.400]   What I find when I do that analysis and then I start actually being willing to do some
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:34.960]   of the answers is, number one, there's a great lack of coherence with some of the things
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.880]   I used to believe.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.800]   A simple example, the latte factor.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.680]   Classic term coined by David Bach.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.600]   Basically if you take the amount of money that you spend on a daily latte, then you
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.640]   invest it, you'll have a lot of money.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.960]   So just eliminate the latte and you'll be rich.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.480]   The reality is, is it true?
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.080]   I think it's unquestionably true.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.720]   I still recommend that people understand the latte factor.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.440]   I think that this is why financial advice needs to be personalized.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:18.520]   If somebody is working, they're making a modest wage, then spending that $5 a day on a daily
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.680]   latte really can deeply harm their results, their financial results in a very real and
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.160]   meaningful way.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.760]   It's a significant expense.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.560]   And if they would stop spending the $5 a day, they'd be better off, significantly better
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.720]   off.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.240]   But from my perspective, when I look at it, I often come down and say, "Is that really
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.580]   worth paying attention to?"
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.820]   Because I spend a lot of time living hyper frugally, avoiding the latte, not buying the
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.200]   glass of wine, taking the cheap thing, et cetera.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   And in some cases it really drains on you.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.320]   Now, if I didn't have the income or I didn't have the ability, I'd still do that stuff
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.920]   because that's how you create a fund.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.800]   If you don't have any money saved, you need to stop buying lattes, stop buying glasses
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.960]   of wine so that you can save enough money to start getting financially independent,
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.920]   start to have something to invest.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.800]   But once you reach a certain point in time, that stuff becomes a net negative because
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.760]   it's easier and simpler for you to focus on doubling your income.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:29.080]   And I think that those opportunities are much more widespread than we often think.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.200]   I'm always torn when people say, "Well, just double your income," because I say, "Well,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.280]   not everybody can do that.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.280]   Don't you know that?"
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.400]   But I think a lot more of us can do that than we often want to admit.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.480]   It's just that nobody's come along and said, "Hey, do that."
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:53.520]   So I think a major super skill of the coming years that you and I can hone is going to
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   be this.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.480]   Look for the most direct paths to your goals.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.020]   Look for the things that are going to make things simpler and easier.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.880]   Look for the ways to do things quickly.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.600]   I've given enough examples so far.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.000]   Look for the ways that you can get somewhere quickly.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.920]   Instead of focusing on how can I retire, focus on how can I not want to retire?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.160]   What can I do there?
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   Instead of focusing on how can I trim my expenses by $10 a month or 10%, look for how can I
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.080]   trim my expenses by 90%.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:37.040]   Instead of looking for how can I cut my tax bill by $52 by saving receipts for feminine
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:46.920]   supplies, look for how can I cut my tax bill by $152,000 by moving from London to Dubai,
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:54.680]   from Toronto to the Cayman Islands, or to Panama City, or from Los Angeles to Dallas.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.520]   How can I make these moves that are going to be simple, yet provide massive, massive
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   savings?
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.400]   It's just an 80/20 analysis.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.720]   What are the 20% of decisions that can give me 80% of the results?
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.400]   Then step two is focus on the major stuff, not the minor stuff.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.120]   Focus on the big picture things.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.400]   If you have to let the over-the-counter medication and feminine supplies receipts drop so that
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.320]   you can get an advanced degree, so that you can increase your earning ability, so that
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.980]   you can start a side hustle that turns into a small business, if you have to let those
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.280]   things drop, let them drop.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   Now, they might not.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.840]   It might be simple for you to go ahead and save the receipts, in which case, fine, do
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   it.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.880]   There's no reason not to, unless the opportunity cost is significant.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:50.320]   But recognize that if focusing on that stuff is keeping you from the big win, move to the
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.360]   big win, dude.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   Focus on the big win.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:03.320]   I think in most situations, you and I would be shocked at how quickly we could make progress
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:14.040]   if we just focused ruthlessly and relentlessly on the high priority, high impact processes.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.920]   I confess I'm not as good at it as I'd like to be.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.000]   It's a big focus of my life going forward.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.680]   Focus and prioritize ruthlessly.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.720]   But I just see day after day after day opportunities for wins.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.160]   You know, just one more example.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.680]   Client of mine, been working with over the last few months, built a medical practice
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.200]   from, had an insight, graduated from medical school, built a medical practice, and I think
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:44.800]   it was about five years, something like that, five or six years, built it into an eight-figure
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   sale.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.400]   An eight-figure sale in about five or six years.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.800]   The eight-figure sale, the profit puts him in a place where he's financially independent
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.880]   five or six years out of medical school.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.280]   And I've thought about his story a lot as far as how he did it, and I've realized how
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.320]   different that path is.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.960]   I think it's a good closing thing to focus on because a lot of my audience is very high
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.000]   income entrepreneurs and professionals.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.640]   But I've thought, you know, if years ago when I was a mainstream financial advisor, if that
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.520]   guy had come to my office and sat down with me and said, "Look, Josh, I'm making, I don't
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.120]   know, a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.320]   I'm making, you know, I'm a physician."
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.720]   And he said, "I want to retire."
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.840]   I would have laid out for him this multi-decade plan, would have said, "Put your money in
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:45.880]   stocks and buy some, use retirement accounts and save money and live frugally and you'll
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.960]   be retired and hey, you can get really, really rich about 30 or 40 years from now."
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.040]   That's what I would have told him.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.280]   And yet, is there anything wrong with that?
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.160]   No, it's pretty sound advice, right?
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.520]   Financial advisors give that advice every day.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.440]   I've given it and it's not wrong.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.640]   But somebody else came along and said, "Listen, if you'll just simply build your practices,
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.280]   start with one, build out to several offices, you can grow this super fast.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.160]   There's plenty of ability to use other people's money.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.640]   You basically use your medical credentials as a way to establish yourself the front end
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.480]   profit and then grow quickly.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.120]   And in five years, you can have a private equity firm come along and make you an eight-figure
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:39.920]   offer, sell out and set yourself up for life in about five years.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.800]   And not set yourself up for life, you know, not buying lattes and whatnot, but just set
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.280]   yourself up for life at the very highest of lifestyles."
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:55.240]   I didn't even think of that back then, to my own shame.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.440]   So it makes me wonder, one of the reasons why do I pursue all these radical strategies,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.040]   it makes me wonder, what am I not thinking of today?
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.400]   What am I ignoring today?
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.840]   Where am I not focusing on today?
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.960]   Can't change the past, but we can go forward.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.360]   So in your life, look for the most direct path to your goal and be wide ranging in your
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   thinking.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:24.800]   Instead of saving feminine hygiene supply receipts and over-the-counter medication and
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.200]   thinking that you're sticking up to Uncle Sam, move, do something drastic.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:37.560]   Instead of worrying about the latte, build a multi-million dollar business if you're
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.120]   interested in that kind of thing.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.000]   Don't feel like you have to change, right, if you're content with what you're doing,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.200]   fine.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.320]   But focus and look for the most direct path to your goals.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.660]   Before you worry about retiring, build a life you don't want to retire from.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.560]   Before you worry about saying, "Well, I want to move to Colorado when I retire," just move
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   to Colorado.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.240]   Get a job there.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   There's jobs everywhere.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.480]   I wish I had an elegant way to wrap up the podcast, but I've said what I want to say.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.760]   I just want to encourage you.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   Focus on the big things.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   I'll be back with you soon.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.780]   I hope I see you soon.
