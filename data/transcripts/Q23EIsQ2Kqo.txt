[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   I am going to read once more the words which are to be found in Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:14.000]   Romans in chapter 8, verses 28, 29, and 30.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.840]   And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.960]   are the called according to his purpose.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:34.160]   For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.840]   he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.640]   Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.880]   justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.240]   Now we've seen that the doctrine which is taught in these three verses is the great
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.560]   doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.800]   It's important that we should realize that that is the doctrine which is taught here,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.640]   and that we do not concentrate only upon subsidiary portions of that great doctrine, or concentrate
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.840]   upon doctrines which are implied by and involved in that great fundamental doctrine.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.400]   The great thing here, and it's given for the comfort of these Romans primarily, but also
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.360]   of all Christians, is this doctrine, that the saints, the called of God, those who love
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:51.720]   God, are going to persist and to be kept persevering right until their final glorification.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   Now having worked out the doctrine as it is shown us by the individual statements and
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.500]   the particulars in this comprehensive statement, we've been considering objections to that
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.840]   doctrine, or perhaps I ought to say difficulties, which many people feel.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.600]   No one should have an objection, and we dealt with that at the beginning, but we've been
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.240]   trying to help those who feel a certain amount of difficulty, and particularly so in the
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.800]   light of certain statements in the Scripture which seem to teach something that is opposed
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.760]   to what is taught so clearly here.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.400]   And we've dealt with a number of such Scriptures.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.360]   We've grouped them under various headings, and have therefore tried to show the principles
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.720]   of interpretation which help us to understand them, and therefore to reconcile even what
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.320]   they've got to say with the teaching that is to be found here.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.360]   Now having done that, our task is still not quite completed, because now surely we are
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.600]   in a position to look at this doctrine once more as a whole, or if you prefer it, I would
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.040]   like to sum up the teaching concerning the final perseverance of the saints, and to produce
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:20.200]   certain further arguments which support this great and, as I'm saying constantly, vital
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.280]   and most encouraging doctrine.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.520]   Now let's look at it like this.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.120]   The argument in these verses, I would suggest, is really quite enough in and of itself, even
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.480]   if we had no other Scriptures at all.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.120]   These verses, these three verses, are sufficient, and more than sufficient, to establish this
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720]   doctrine.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.920]   Let me divide that up and put it like this.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.400]   The fact, as we've already seen many weeks ago, that this is God's purpose, is in and
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.220]   of itself sufficient.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.400]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.080]   the called according to his purpose.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.720]   God is going to make all things work together for their good, he's going to overrule everything
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.440]   for their good, because he has got a certain purpose for them.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.480]   That's what the apostles say.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.600]   So that the very fact that we are in the purpose of God is enough in and of itself.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.680]   When God purposes a thing, he always carries it through.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.640]   That is something which is axiomatic.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.960]   He is the Father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.280]   God is, and anything that God proposes or purposes to do is something that will most
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.200]   certainly be carried out.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.280]   So that we can say with top leading, on that one word purpose, his purpose, that alone
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.200]   is enough to enable us to say, things future nor things that are now, nor all things below
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:14.800]   nor above, can make him his purpose forego, or sever my soul from his love.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.120]   Very well, but I want to show you that all the terms really that the apostle uses carry
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.800]   with them the same inevitable implication.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.280]   Now we dealt at great length with foreknowledge, so I don't return to that this evening.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.320]   But I'm anxious to show this, that whatever view you take of foreknowledge, the other
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.920]   terms make it quite impossible for a child of God finally to be cast away.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.480]   Now let me show you what I mean.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.000]   Take this word predestinate.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.920]   Here we are told that God's purpose for us is this.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:05.100]   He has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his Son.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.600]   These people whom he has foreknown, now for the sake of argument only, I'm saying whatever
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.040]   view you may take of that, even if you merely interpret it as a sort of pre-chance, that
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.980]   God knowing everything, knows everything before him.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.480]   He knows everything that's ever going to take place.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.960]   Even if you take it just as that, without anything further, then you've got to realize
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:37.040]   this, that all whom God has known, foreknown, in that way, he has predestinated to this
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.160]   great purpose and end of being conformed to the image of his Son.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.920]   In other words, God doesn't merely propose to forgive such people.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.400]   Now that's where so many go wrong.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:58.000]   They think of salvation solely in terms of forgiveness, but that isn't it.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.480]   The moment God has foreknowned them, he predestinates them to be conformed to the image of his Son,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.960]   that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.520]   Very well.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:19.440]   So that if God has known you as one of his people, then he has taken this great decision
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.320]   with respect to you.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.880]   He's already predestinated you to that ultimate end, to be glorified like his Son.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:36.240]   Therefore, if it's possible for anyone to fall away, it means that God made a mistake
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.920]   when he predestinated such people to that glory.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.240]   Now I'm arguing on the supposition that you mean by predestination, that you mean by foreknowledge,
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.480]   simply this, that God knew that you were going to decide at a given point to believe in the
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.840]   Lord Jesus Christ, even granting that.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.680]   On the basis of that foreknowledge, he then immediately predestinated you to this ultimate
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.040]   glory.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.200]   So that if you then tell me that you can still fall away and be lost and reprobate, well
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.680]   I ask the question, what was the point in predestinating you to this ultimate glory?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.840]   It was a mistake.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.800]   It was wrong.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.040]   You reconcile that, if you can, with foreknowledge, even on those terms and according to that
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.680]   definition of it.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.720]   It makes the thing quite ridiculous.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.120]   Very well, there's the term predestinate.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.440]   But then take this term called.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.960]   Giving that meaning again, if you like, to foreknowledge for the sake of argument.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.600]   What we are told is this, that God calls these people.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.040]   Whom he did predestinate them, he also called.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.680]   Called unto himself in the way that we have seen and have defined.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.800]   And remember, this call is an effectual one.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.920]   This is the thing that brings people to belief, and that makes believers of them in the Lord
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   Jesus Christ.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.760]   Now, what the apostle is saying is this, that if God has foreknown you, because of that
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:19.680]   foreknowledge, he has called you in this effectual manner to a belief in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.160]   as your personal Savior.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:32.340]   But if you want to say that you can depart from that, and end as a reprobate, finally
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:38.400]   cast out, well then you are left once more in exactly the same position.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.560]   If God knew, as he must know in his foreknowledge, that you're going to end by denying the truth
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.920]   and by being reprobate, why did he ever call you?
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.360]   What is the purpose in giving a kind of temporary call to people who mean those are finally
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   going to be reprobate?
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.740]   The thing, of course, is nothing but just sheer, not only intellectual confusion, but
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.900]   utter confusion from every conceivable standpoint.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.980]   It makes the work of God utterly chaotic.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.460]   Now remember that it is God who does every single one of these things for those who love
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.220]   him, for those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:28.860]   So we are left in this position that God has called these people to belief quite uselessly,
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:35.600]   though he knows they're going to fall back into unbelief and to perdition.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.940]   It leaves us with this contradiction in the mind and the purpose of God and even in his
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940]   foreknowledge.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:50.940]   But then we go on to the next term, which is them whom he called, them he also justified.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.940]   Now here, as we've seen, is another most important term.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.660]   Justification is the act of God.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:07.980]   It is God declaring that we are just and that he regards us as just because he has given
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.340]   to us the righteousness of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:21.780]   Now, nowhere is there any suspicion of a suggestion that this is something which is conditional.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:27.060]   It is a great act, a great declaration by God.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.140]   He justifies, you remember we are told in the fourth chapter, in the fifth verse, the
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   ungodly.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.280]   It doesn't justify us because of our state and condition.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.580]   He does it in spite of that.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.220]   He justifies the ungodly.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:50.380]   He puts us into that position and he makes that statement with respect to us, that we
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.140]   now are in this position of being justified in his sight.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.460]   Well, again, you see the position you're left with if you believe that it's possible for
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:07.220]   a believer finally to fall away, that God has made this declaration concerning a person
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.260]   who is finally going to be reprimanded.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:18.100]   And surely once more there was no purpose in making a declaration concerning the righteousness
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.420]   of this person if God knows that subsequently they're going to fall away.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:30.420]   It just brings this whole element of confusion and of chaos into God's way of doing things,
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.300]   which surely the whole Bible proclaims is something that is never true of God's work.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.220]   It is inconceivable.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:45.020]   God does everything, always, in every realm and department, in a manner which is orderly
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.100]   above everything else.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.520]   And it is done with a perfection that characterizes all the actions of God.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.820]   The whole notion of being temporarily justified is something which is foreign not only to
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:05.420]   the whole of the biblical teaching, but to one's entire understanding of the being and
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.340]   the nature of God.
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.380]   God does not go back on his decisions.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.580]   God does not, in this sense, repent.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   Now you may say to me, "But we are told in the scripture that he does."
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.980]   Well, if you take your context in such cases, you will always find that God is using an
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.740]   anthropomorphism.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.700]   He is speaking as if he were human in order to teach a lesson to the people.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:37.660]   But God does not change and cannot change by his very nature, and his purposes are forever
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.660]   sure.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.740]   But I've got a final argument.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:50.620]   Even if I were to grant for the sake of argument that it was possible for a justified person
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.360]   to fall away, I don't grant it, I can't grant it.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:02.120]   But even if I did, for the sake of argument, my next word clinches the whole matter.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:09.160]   And them whom he hath justified, them he hath also glorified.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.360]   Now here is, of course, the final proof.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.480]   And I would remind you that we saw when we were dealing with this word that the tense
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.820]   that the apostle uses is that Aorist tense.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.360]   It has already happened.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.200]   James Denny has to admit that it's the most daring statement that even the apostle Paul
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.840]   ever made.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.520]   The most daring anticipation, and yet there's nothing daring about it, because it is of
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.600]   God that he is speaking.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   In other words, we are not merely justified.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.960]   We are not merely forgiven, I say, we are not merely justified.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.080]   If God has foreknown us as people who are going to be Christians, well then the statement
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.640]   is that he's already glorified us.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.120]   It's already happened.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.440]   And glorification does not belong to this life and this world.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.500]   Glorification belongs to the next world, to the life that is yet to come.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.280]   So that this cannot be temporary, this is a term that simply cannot be temporary at
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   all.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:20.040]   This is a term that describes that ultimate act whereby God will even deal with our mortal
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.720]   bodies and they will be glorified, and we shall be conformable to the image of his dear
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   son.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.840]   This is something beyond time, beyond the grave, beyond anything that we can do in this
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   world.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:41.120]   And the argument is, you see, that whom God has foreknown, he has already glorified.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.800]   Where do you fit your falling from grace into that?
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.440]   Now is it possible for such a person finally to fall away?
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:59.280]   Now isn't it important to look at these terms and to give due weight to each and every one
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.320]   of them?
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:07.560]   The statement here is that in the mind and the purpose of God, and that means the things
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.240]   really happen, nothing can stop it.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:20.360]   All who are Christian have had these various terms and stages applied to them.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:27.200]   If it were possible for anybody to fall out of any one of these words and terms and statements,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.040]   there is only one conclusion to draw, you see, and that is that God would have made
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.840]   a mistake, or else that his foreknowledge was somehow defective.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   He thought this person was going to hold on and was going to continue as a believer and
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.160]   was going to continue being obedient, and therefore he glorified such a person.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.780]   Well the whole position, as I say, becomes quite ridiculous.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.080]   There is no other word to use.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.920]   You cannot believe what is taught here about foreknowledge on any explanation of it, and
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:07.240]   I still say that it is possible for a true believer ever to fall away.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.440]   Every single term that is used makes the thing completely impossible.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:20.480]   In other words, this statement that we've been looking at is an unbreakable chain.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.880]   It is unbreakable.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.840]   Each link is there firmly fixed to the other, and there is no room left for falling away
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.640]   at any point whatsoever.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:44.080]   And you are left with that impossible question of trying to reconcile God's eternal foreknowledge
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.220]   on any definition of the term with such a failure.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.880]   And you are driven back to one of those two conclusions, either that there is a defect
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:06.280]   in his foreknowledge, or else that somehow or another he has made a mistake, that he
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:12.920]   has started a working people and suddenly it comes to an end.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:19.080]   Now there is the argument, as I say, that emerges simply from this statement in and
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   of itself.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.840]   But wait a minute, we can go further.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:31.000]   There is a complete confirmation of this in all the other things that are said about believers.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.680]   Now let's have a look at some of the things that we are told about believers, about Christian
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   people.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.240]   Not temporary believers, but those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.120]   Not those who've got just an intellectual faith, not the kind of people we've been
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.560]   dealing with the last few weeks in these warning passages and so on.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.640]   I'm talking about now those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:01.240]   Now let's see the things that we are told about them.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.560]   And as we do so, I think we'll see this, that the cardinal error which we all tend
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:17.320]   to make is, is to think of ourselves as Christians in terms of our believing and our holding
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.280]   on, instead of looking at it in the way in which the scripture always presents it to
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.280]   us.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.040]   Now I'm certain that this is the ultimate cause of this whole trouble.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:37.840]   There has been so much emphasis upon decision, our believing, our action, our not doing this,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.000]   our doing that.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.360]   All the emphasis has been placed upon us.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.280]   Whereas as we see in these three verses, without going further, the emphasis in the scripture
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.400]   is always on the other side.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:59.720]   And it leads to this position, that we fail to realize that what we are saved by ultimately
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.800]   is the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.560]   Now I read to you the fifth chapter of this great epistle tonight, in order that I might
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.020]   remind you of some of these things.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.280]   You see, we must never forget that this epistle is a whole.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.960]   Some of you friends may have come in only since we've been doing these three verses,
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.400]   and you may find it difficult.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   Well if you'd been here when we were doing chapter five, you wouldn't find it so difficult.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.280]   This is the kind of climax the apostle works up to.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.520]   All he's arguing here, he's been laying down the foundation of it before.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.080]   And that's why it's so important to take these things leisurely and to see exactly what he's
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.120]   saying, and then he lends you in an inevitable position.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.800]   It's like a great building going up.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:48.040]   Well now then, look at what he says in chapter five in verses nine and ten.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.840]   He says much more than, "Being now justified by his blood," that's to say by the blood
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:04.220]   of the Lord Jesus Christ, "we shall be saved from wrath through him."
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:11.500]   In other words, his argument you see is this, that the point we've arrived at is that we've
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.200]   been declared just.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.520]   We know that we are justified.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.760]   Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God and so on.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.940]   Now he says that's been accomplished for us by the death of Christ, by the blood of Christ.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:32.620]   And his argument is this, that if we are now justified by his blood, well much more than,
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:38.300]   we shall be saved right to the end and to that final glory which he puts in terms of
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.460]   from wrath, which is the final judgment.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.140]   We've got nothing to fear about that.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.500]   We are saved from wrath.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   How?
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.980]   Well, through him.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.460]   Justified by his blood, but ultimately saved through him.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.380]   Now verse ten then expounds that more in detail.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:03.540]   "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son," much more
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:11.900]   being reconciled, "we shall be saved," the authorized version has, "by his life."
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.700]   But we saw at the time that a better translation is, "in his life."
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.340]   Now do you see how it works?
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:26.260]   His death upon the cross for us, even while we were enemies, is the thing that has reconciled
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.260]   us to God.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.500]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.780]   He has done it by the death of his Son upon the cross.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.700]   Now there is the means of reconciliation.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:43.940]   And his argument is that if he's reconciled us by the death of his Son, how much more?
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.100]   Shall we be saved in the life of Christ?
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.060]   The death of Christ has reconciled me.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:56.740]   Well, how much more will his life save me for that final glorification?
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:03.940]   But the thing I'm emphasizing is this, that it is in the life of Christ that this is going
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.940]   to happen to me.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:11.180]   You see, I'm out of the realm of my faith, my holding on.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.500]   I'm in this new realm.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.740]   I'll work that out with you in a moment.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.180]   But now there is the sort of basis of the truth concerning the Christian.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.320]   Then you see, these are the things that follow.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.900]   The Christian is a man who is already dead to sin.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.380]   Now then, here's chapter 6, you see.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.380]   The apostle starts off by asking, "What shall we say then?
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.540]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.100]   He answers, "God forbid.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   How shall we?"
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:50.380]   I'm reading the Authorized, "that are dead to sin live any longer therein?"
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.220]   But the Authorized isn't strong enough here.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.520]   The true translation is this, "God forbid.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:03.200]   How shall we that died to sin live any longer therein?"
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.940]   As Christian people, we have died to sin.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.800]   It's an airy stence again.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.340]   It is something that has happened once and forever in the past.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:19.140]   Christian people are those who have died to sin.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.180]   It happened when he died on the cross.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.380]   We died with him.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.580]   That's the whole argument from verse 2 to verse 6 in this sixth chapter.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:34.060]   "Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.020]   Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like us Christ was raised
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.620]   up from the dead by the glory of the Father.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.700]   Even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.740]   For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.260]   the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.820]   Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him."
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.900]   That's the right translation.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.460]   Our old man is crucified.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.580]   It means the same thing.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.980]   But the really correct translation is, "Our old man was crucified with him."
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.140]   It's happened.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:14.020]   You see, this notion that the Christian is a sort of old man who's holding on by faith
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.620]   is an absolute denial of the scripture.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.380]   That old man is gone.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.420]   He's dead, finished with, buried with Christ.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.620]   He's no longer in existence.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.020]   That's the apostle's argument.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.620]   But let's go on, let's follow him from verse 8 onwards.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.580]   Now he says, "If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.300]   knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.660]   over him and not over us, therefore because of this relationship.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:52.460]   For in that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:26:05.380]   Likewise, reckon ye yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, and but alive unto God
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.020]   through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:18.260]   And then take verse 18, which says it all again, "Being then made free from sin, he
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.700]   became the servants of righteousness."
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.980]   Now those who were here at the time will recall that we made it clear that there's only one
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.420]   conceivable explanation of all that.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.220]   It means that we are dead to the realm and the dominion of sin.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.340]   Doesn't mean that we are sinless, doesn't mean that we can't fall into sin, but it does
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:46.140]   mean that whereas until our conversion we were under the dominion of sin and Satan,
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.820]   we are no longer there.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.100]   Now it's because people don't seem to realize that they talk about this possibility of falling
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.100]   away.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.780]   They will persist in thinking of my decision, my believing, my holding on.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.740]   My dear friend, something tremendous has happened to you.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.620]   You mustn't think of it like that, get rid of that, that's childish thinking.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.420]   This is the truth.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.100]   We have died unto sin.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.360]   We've finished with it.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.260]   We no longer belong to that realm.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.300]   It's the whole argument of this sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.580]   But then I go on in the third place to say that we are also dead to the law.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.600]   Not only to sin, but to the law.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.820]   Look at verse 14 of chapter 6.
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.740]   "For sin shall not have dominion over you."
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.740]   Why?
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:40.580]   "For you are not under the law, but under grace."
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.140]   This vital change has taken place in the Christian.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.620]   He is no longer under the law.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.760]   Every man who's not a Christian is under the law.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.760]   The Christian isn't.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.900]   He's finished with that, he's dead to the law.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   He's now under grace.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:01.100]   Of course, the early verses of chapter 7 are given exclusively to a further exposition
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.100]   of that statement.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.780]   "Know ye not, brethren?"
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.980]   Then in brackets, "I speak to them that know the law, how that the law dominion over a
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.100]   man as long as he liveth."
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.260]   Then an illustration, "For the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.580]   husband as long as he liveth.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.820]   But if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.340]   So then, if while her husband liveth she be married to another man, she shall be called
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.340]   an adulteress.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:32.500]   But if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.260]   she be married to another man."
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.660]   There's the illustration.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.460]   Wherefore, this being applied means this.
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:47.660]   My brethren, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.780]   The death of Christ has separated us from our union with the law.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.620]   It's exactly as if a husband died and the woman's free to marry again.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:02.620]   We are dead to the law by the death of Christ in order that we should be married to another.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.920]   Even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.180]   We are to have children by this second marriage now, not the old children that we used to
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.380]   produce when we were tied to the law and sin.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.740]   Married to Christ, we produce new fruit, new children.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.540]   For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.900]   members to bring forth fruit unto death.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:31.380]   But now, we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held, that we should
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.940]   serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the latter.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:42.140]   Now, could anything be more explicit or more plain or clear than that?
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.900]   You see what it comes to is this.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:52.180]   There is no longer remaining anything that can condemn the Christian.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.620]   It's the law that condemns always.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:03.380]   We read it tonight again in this fifth chapter that where there is no law, sin is not imputed.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.180]   And he'd already said the same thing in the fourth chapter.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.340]   He says because the law worketh in verse 15, the law worketh wrath, for where no law is,
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.340]   there is no transgression.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:18.660]   Well, now then, we have been entirely taken away from the law.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.140]   There is nothing now left that can condemn us.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.260]   It's impossible we should become reprobate.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.100]   There's nothing to condemn us.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.180]   So he says it in the first verse of chapter eight.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:34.580]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.580]   There isn't, there never can be.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.020]   They're no longer under the law.
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.900]   They've been transferred right out of it.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.820]   They're in this realm of grace.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.260]   They're in this entirely new relationship.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.980]   And remember that what we've seen is this, therefore.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.940]   The old man has gone once and forever.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:04.660]   He died with Christ, knowing that our old man was crucified with Christ.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.940]   Romans 6.6, what a vital statement it is.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.500]   Now he can't come back.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   He's been dead, buried.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.420]   Christ is never going to die again.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.420]   Right.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.540]   You and I can never die again because we are in him.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.420]   That old man can never come back.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.180]   And if I'm not an old man, I'm a new man.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.860]   And as a new man, I can never be reprobate.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.060]   The thing is a sheer impossibility.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:32.100]   Now why is it that we will, why we fail to take these great terms and to realize their
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:39.020]   meaning and significance, and are so anxious about our part that we get into these intellectual
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.020]   confusions?
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.860]   The old man has gone and has gone forever.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.220]   We are finished with the law.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.820]   We're finished with sin.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.540]   We are finished with every form of condemnation.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:56.220]   And to make it doubly certain, all this that has happened to us has been the result of
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.260]   God's action, not ours.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:06.100]   You see, it is God who has crucified us with Christ.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.620]   I am crucified with Christ, says Paul to the Galatians.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.940]   It means again, I was crucified with him.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.020]   Well, we didn't do it.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.900]   It was the Father who did it.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.020]   God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.100]   of God in him.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.380]   And he's done all these things to us.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.460]   So we're in this entirely new position in which it's impossible for us to go back to
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.260]   the old realm, and all as a result of the action of God.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.860]   But wait a minute, there's still more.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:42.180]   The next term, the fourth term I would consider with you is the new birth, which is of course
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:48.260]   suggested in Romans 8 too, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.100]   me free from the law of sin and death."
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.420]   Now again, I would indicate this.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:02.380]   I find more and more that people get into trouble simply because they do not realize
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.940]   the truth concerning the new birth and regeneration.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.940]   Of course, if you ask them in a catechism, "Do you believe in the rebirth?"
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.880]   they'd say yes.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.180]   But some or another though, they believe in it intellectually when they get into difficulties
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.700]   and the devil attacks, they seem to forget all about regeneration and the rebirth.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.980]   We will keep on thinking of salvation as if it were only a matter of forgiveness, and
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:34.180]   our deciding for Christ and taking up the Christian life.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.940]   My dear friends, let's begin to think of it the other way around.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.300]   The most glorious thing is this doctrine of the rebirth.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   What's this?
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.380]   Well this is what God does to us through the Spirit.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.980]   We don't give birth to ourselves.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.980]   We are not reborn because we believe.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   We believe because we are reborn.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.460]   And what is the rebirth?
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.380]   The rebirth is God putting a new principle of life into us.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:07.220]   "Ye who hath he quickened," he says in Ephesians 2, "who were dead in trespasses
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.220]   and sins."
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:14.580]   God quickens us, puts new life into us, puts this new principle into us.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.300]   So let's give that its value.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.860]   God I say brings us to a new birth, or to take another term, it's a new creation.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:30.060]   The God who created men at the beginning creates us who are Christians anew.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.420]   If any man being Christ, he's a new creation, a new creature.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.380]   All things are passed away, behold all things have become new.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.380]   Very well.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.940]   God brings to birth a new being, a new man.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.860]   Is that only temporary?
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:51.500]   If it's only temporary, well then I ask with reverence, why does God ever do it at
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.900]   all?
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.260]   If God knows that I'm going to be finally reprobate, why does he ever bring me to a
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   birth at all?
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.340]   The thing is inconceivable.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.260]   It means again I say, either that God has made a mistake about me in giving me this
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:12.380]   new life and this new birth, or else he hasn't got the power to keep me and to hold me.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:19.180]   We are driven to these conclusions, which are monstrously impossible.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.780]   Well you've got it again in this eighth chapter, listen to verses five to ten.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.180]   For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.220]   after the spirit, the things of the spirit.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:34.540]   A Christian, you see, is no longer after the flesh, he's after the spirit.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:40.340]   To be carnally minded is death, to be spiritually minded, which is what a Christian is, is life
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:45.300]   and peace, because the carnal mind is enmity against God, it is not subject to the law
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.500]   of God, neither indeed can be, so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.260]   But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.220]   This great change has taken place.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.140]   The Christian's an entirely new person, no longer in the flesh, but in the spirit.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.220]   If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you, now if any man have not the spirit of Christ,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.220]   he's none of this.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.140]   He's a temporary believer perhaps, he gives people the impression that he's a Christian,
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.980]   but he's never been one.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.820]   The man who has the spirit of God and Christ in him, he is the Christian.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.980]   And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   of righteousness.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.980]   And then the argument follows that if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:32.180]   dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quickly a mortal
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.020]   body.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:40.340]   Because the spirit's in you, the redemption of your body is inherently guaranteed, because
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.540]   he will do so by the spirit that dwelleth in you.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:54.100]   Very well, this whole doctrine of the rebirth, in and of itself it seems to me, should be
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:59.580]   sufficient for all of us to settle this matter once and forever.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:05.260]   You see, if to be Christian just means that for the time being you believe in Christ and
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:10.620]   therefore you are forgiven, but that it's all contingent upon your going on, well, then
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.780]   there would be a possibility of a fall.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.340]   But you see, that isn't the truth.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:23.180]   Once a man is a Christian, that man is already born again.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.780]   He's no longer in the flesh, he's in the spirit.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.580]   He's finished with the law, he's dead to the whole realm and dominion of sin and Satan.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.940]   He's in this entirely new position.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.060]   God has given him this new gift of life.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.620]   And what you're asking one to believe is that all that can suddenly be undone, that God's
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.420]   own creative act can be undone.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.940]   It's a terrible and a monstrous thing to suggest.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.900]   No, the right way to look at these things is this.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.060]   We mustn't put the emphasis upon what we do.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.900]   What we do follows what God has done.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:15.180]   We, he says, in Ephesians 2.10, we are his workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:21.460]   unto good works that he hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.380]   That's what it is.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:29.940]   You see, we don't maintain the position by our good works at any point.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:36.860]   But he has made us, we are his workmanship, and he has created us anew in Christ Jesus
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:44.420]   in order that, with the object and intention that, we should do these good works.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:50.260]   And always, of course, to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.940]   And again, the position that you are left with is this, that if it is possible for such
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:00.660]   people to fall away, well then, God's work has failed.
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.580]   God's workmanship is imperfect.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.900]   The thing is impossible.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:11.180]   And that brings me to my last argument for this night, which is this one.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.900]   I'm trying to put these in an ascending scale.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:21.980]   The last great argument is the all we are told about ourselves in terms of our union
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.980]   with Christ.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:32.380]   Now that's already been introduced to us in chapter 5 in verses 9 and 10.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:38.180]   Much more now than being justified, by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.180]   him.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:45.860]   For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:53.980]   being reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.380]   Now here it is.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:05.380]   This is something that goes beyond even the new birth, even beyond regeneration.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:13.140]   It's the thing, of course, that the apostle works out in detail in chapter 5 from verse
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:17.140]   12 to verse 21.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.860]   I wish you'd all been here when we were doing that.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.940]   I felt it at the time.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.300]   I felt to myself, what a pity, some people will probably come in in chapter 8 and they
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.820]   won't be able to follow it properly because they haven't heard all this.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:35.140]   We spent many weeks on verses 12 to 21 in chapter 5.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.900]   It's basic.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.820]   Chapter 8, you know, is nothing but an extended exposition of this.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.940]   That's what it is.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.300]   Here's the key to it all.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:51.500]   This fifth chapter is the key chapter in many ways, as I said at the time.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.660]   Now there, you see, let me summarize it like this by putting it in this manner.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:01.080]   He says that we all by nature were in Adam.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.340]   We were all united to Adam.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:09.140]   And what Adam did applied to all of us.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:18.140]   Verse 12, "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:25.860]   And so death passed upon all men, for that all sinned, and they sinned in Adam."
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.660]   Adam was our representative.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.140]   And when he sinned, we all sinned with him.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.900]   We've all been involved in the consequences of Adam's action.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.900]   Why?
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.900]   Because we were in Adam.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.100]   But, you see, the whole glory, he says, is this.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.180]   That if you're a Christian, you're no longer in Adam.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.220]   You are in Christ.
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:53.900]   This new man, this beginner of this new humanity.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.860]   We are dead to Adam.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.300]   That's what the old man means.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.580]   The man I was in Adam is dead.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.740]   I'm a new man.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.900]   And my new man is the man that is in Christ.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.100]   We are united to him.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.020]   We are in him, in his life.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.580]   Everything that you are told about him becomes true of us.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.380]   That's the argument worked out, as I showed you just now in reading those verses from
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.840]   chapter 6.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.260]   We are involved in his death.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.620]   We're involved in his burial.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.460]   We're involved in his resurrection.
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.620]   We are planted with him, united with him.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.540]   All that's happened to him has happened to us.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   That's how my old man died.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.620]   That's how I'm risen, and so on.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.700]   Here it is.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.020]   Now then, this is the vital doctrine in this whole matter.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.580]   You see, as a Christian, I'm not merely a forgiven man.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.060]   I am in Christ.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.940]   I am a part of Christ.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.100]   I'm united to him.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.700]   The same apostle puts it like this in the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.580]   6, and verse 17.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:04.020]   He says, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit."
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.980]   He's one spirit with the Lord.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.900]   One Corinthians 6, 17.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.820]   Have a look at that.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:18.780]   But if you want a final argument that simply cannot be refuted at all, it is the tremendous
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.940]   statement in Ephesians 2, 6.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.460]   He's been reminding the Ephesians of what's happened to them.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:34.860]   "While they were dead in trespasses and sins, God quickened them together with Christ.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.060]   But he's also raised us up together," he says, "with Christ."
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:44.180]   And then he goes on to make this amazing statement, Ephesians 2, 6.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:53.620]   "And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.620]   Jesus."
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.940]   Now here's the point.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.780]   He isn't saying there that that's going to happen to us.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:06.140]   What he's telling these Ephesians is that it's already happened to them.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:13.220]   As certainly as they were quickened, they are now seated in the heavenly places in Christ
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.220]   Jesus.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.100]   God's done all this to us.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:25.060]   You see, by doing everything to us in Christ, it means that in Christ at this very moment,
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.500]   you are not only sitting in Westminster Chapel, you are seated in the heavenly places in Christ
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.020]   Jesus.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.660]   And so what you're asking me to believe, if you reject the doctrine of the final perseverance
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:42.660]   of the saints, is this, that it is possible for a man to be seated in the heavenly places
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:50.300]   in Christ Jesus at one point, and yet to come right down from that and to be cast into hell.
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.660]   My friends, God doesn't work like that.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.460]   God doesn't make mistakes.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.860]   I may appoint a man to a post and discover afterwards that I've made a mistake and have
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.220]   to dismiss him.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.140]   But God isn't man.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:12.820]   God knows everything, has foreknowledge.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.860]   And are you asking me to believe that it's possible and conceivable that God should actually
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:27.700]   raise a man into the heavenly places in Christ, and yet for that man finally to be cast away?
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.700]   If we think a thing like that, it means we have no conception of what the heavenly places
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.700]   mean.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:39.260]   We have no idea as to what it means to be in Christ, to be joined to him indissolubly,
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.760]   to become a part of him.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   What is the church?
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.740]   It's the body of Christ, and we're all members in particular.
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.380]   There is this absolute view.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.840]   We are not merely forgiven.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.620]   We are not just believers.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.140]   God's done these things to us.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:46:13.940]   We are not only new life, but we are united to Christ, bound to him by bonds that are
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.940]   indissoluble.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:21.940]   I've taken you through these steps and stages in order that you may see how inevitable is
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:27.700]   the thing the apostle is arguing in these three glorious verses.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:37.980]   Everything we are told about the Christian makes it impossible for him ever to fall away.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.500]   The only people who can fall away are the people who have been temporary believers,
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:48.860]   false professors, people who had just an intellectual temporary faith.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:54.740]   But the man who is given the new life, who is a partaker of the divine nature, and who
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:47:04.740]   is in Christ, such a man by the very definition of the terms, cannot fall away.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:11.220]   And there are yet other arguments which substantiate this still further.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.660]   And God willing, we'll go on to look at them next Friday night.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.380]   Let us pray.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:30.820]   O Lord our God, we come unto thee with a sense of wonder, love, and praise.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:37.380]   O forgive us that we are so slow to believe thy word and to substitute our own thoughts
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.300]   and ideas for it.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:46.420]   O God, by thy Spirit, help all in thy presence at this moment to realize what it means to
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:55.580]   be a Christian, to realize that we are thy workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus,
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:05.980]   united with him, the living head, parts of him, of his flesh and of his bones, one spirit
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:11.300]   with him, seated with him in the heavenly places.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:21.460]   O Lord, give us understanding, and such understanding by thy Spirit that we shall indeed become
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:30.300]   lost in praise, and never show it in our lives and with our lips.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.460]   Bless thy precious truth to us, O God.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.420]   We ask it in the name of thy dear Son.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.340]   We know thou dost desire us to be a rejoicing people, that the world may know that we have
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:53.380]   a joy unspeakable and full of glory as we realize these things.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:49:01.140]   Lord, make us such by enlightening our understanding to these precious truths.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:07.100]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:13.660]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:22.460]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:29.460]   shall see him as he is and be like him, and be made conformable perfectly even in our
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:34.460]   bodies to his glory.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.700]   Amen.
