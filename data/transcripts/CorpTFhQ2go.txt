[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   All right, Jesse, it's late, but better late than never.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   In this final segment, I want to mention the books I read in December 2022.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   As you might recall, December for me is Thriller December.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It is the month in which I like to read adventure or thriller novels.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   That's the genre that I really like.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   There's a lot of holidays in December, so it's a tradition of mine to read more thrillers than normal in December.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So I read three thrillers in December, Jesse, and I will go through them all right now.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   All right, the first one I read, The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   This is a action thriller that takes place in an alternative timeline.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   So it's in the 70s, and it's positing an alternative timeline where we did a few more Apollo programs.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And I don't want to give too many details away other than there's gun battles happening in space with the Soviets.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   What was cool about this book, what attracted me to it is that Chris Hadfield, the author, is an astronaut.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So this actually has realistic, realistic details of how all the 1970s era Apollo space program technology actually worked.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   He actually understands space and what this world is like.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   So I like that idea that it was written by an astronaut.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   A book about astronaut murders is pretty good.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The next one I read was Recursion by Blake Crouch.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I want to flag this book for a second because I read a lot of thrillers.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Recursion is about as platonic of an example I have found of perfection in pacing.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's like a master class in thriller structure and pacing.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Really, this piece of it is brilliantly done.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's datelined chapters, and you're moving back and forth between two timelines, and those timelines kind of catch up.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And the way it moves back and forth, back and forth, and ratchets up is just a precision plot construction.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's a book that's really hard to put down once you pick it up.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I was really impressed by it.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Actually, I was so impressed by it that I was a little bit disappointed when I went back to read a prior book of Blake's, which was good.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But man, with Recursion, he has the pacing just locked in.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's the best thriller pacing I've read, one of the best thriller pacings I've probably ever read.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   When was it written?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   This book would have been, I don't know, the last 10 years or something like that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's like a time, I won't give away everything that happens, but the way it opens is it's playing with time.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So he's a techno-thriller writer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   He's like our age.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   He's not like, I used to say relatively young.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I guess we're not that young anymore.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   But there's this virus sort of happening where people are having memories of different lives suddenly appear.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And it seems to be contagious, like people nearby have the same thing happen.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And there's a detective that's trying to unwind what's going on.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And then it starts to unravel.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And then you get a plot line from back in time and it catches up.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And then it gets crazy at the end.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Anyways, perfection in structure and pacing.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   The last thriller I read in December was The Last Juror by John Grisham.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I just had it from a little free library here in Tacoma Park.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And here's the thing about being a writer like John Grisham.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   If you have that one or two huge successes early on, you can just keep writing books that don't have to be blockbusters.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Like if The Last Juror was written by someone else, you know, like us.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Nice.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But because he wrote The Firm, because he wrote The Pelican Brief and The Client, and he became such a superstar,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   you could just write these books where they don't have to be bangers.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's just interesting.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's just, it's a guy starting up a newspaper in the small Mississippi town that he likes to write about.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And there's a trial and 20 years later, like some of the jurors start dying out, like being killed.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Right.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And then they kind of figure out what's going on.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   That's the book.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But I enjoyed it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I enjoyed it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But if, if, if this was the book you ran instead of The Firm, you wouldn't know the name John Grisham.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So it's a good gig if you can get it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   There's another thriller I didn't quite finish in December.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So I'll get to that in the January.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So I really read four in December, but the fifth one I didn't finish until into January.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So we'll get it with the next list.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   All right.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I read two other books as well.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Non-thrillers.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   One was called Living with Frankenstein by Stephen Schoen.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   This is I'm working on some things with artificial intelligence.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So this is like a small philosophical tract about machine sentience.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And this is like a gentleman scholar has this thesis about, you know, what does it really mean for technology to be conscious?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And he has a much lower bar for that.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And things were already there.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I needed it for something I was doing.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   What I enjoyed more was John Meacham's And There Was Light.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It was John Meacham's new Lincoln biography.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It was very good.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Very good.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So Meacham is taking a he's looking at Lincoln through the lens of in part ethics and in part religion.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So the virtue ethics worldview of Lincoln and then also the impact of religions on Lincoln.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I think the early part of Lincoln's life, I really enjoyed the way this Meacham treated it because what he does good in this book, and I've read a lot of Lincoln books.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   What he does good in this book is set context.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So there's a lot of primary sources that he pulls from to set the context.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So it's one of the better, for example, depictions of Southern culture and, uh, during the pre-war period, because he, he pulls from sermons and newspapers and headlines to try to really understand the reactionary culture that was emerging in the South in defense of slavery.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And like understanding that really helps make sense of some of the big historical things that happen.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   He goes to primary sources to get there.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Uh, another thing I learned from Meacham, which was really interesting was I didn't know this, and I read a lot of Lincoln that, you know, Lincoln's family, when he was a young kid was attending a church at one of these rural churches.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That was, um, it's very antislavery.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So he was, he was exposed to antislavery thinking in part because of this was the early exposure he had to it was in church, which I hadn't heard.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I had heard about the, there's a labor argument, you know, his dad, um, was a working poor working class white and Illinois were worried about the economic ramifications of slave labor coming into their state.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So I had heard that piece of it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So he grew up in an antislavery household, but he was inculcated with a religious antislavery message and Meacham went back and like found, here's the preacher and here's the type of things they talked about.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So I thought that was all good.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Once they get to the war and the presidency, it's like real fast.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   He just covers it and you know, 70 pages.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It just, it moves by really fast, but enjoyed it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   All right, Jesse, those are my five books from December.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Next month we will talk about the five books I read in January.
