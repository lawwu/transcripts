[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.300]   What about when you, when you don't know someone, you know, there's, there's practicing for
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.440]   a conversation, you know, you're going to have, and then there's, I'm going to a cocktail
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.440]   party.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   I'm going to a conference.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.360]   I don't know who I'm going to meet or who they're going to be.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.940]   Is there a way to just build repetition or, or get your reps in for practicing conversational
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.160]   skills without any person that you know, you're talking to that makes sense?
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.040]   I absolutely do practice my question techniques in private.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760]   When there's somebody that I meet and I don't think I'm ever going to meet them again.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   I just throw out a question approach to see how will they respond?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.240]   I try to direct them, tell me what you were doing this weekend instead of, so what were
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   you doing this weekend?
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.600]   I try it and see what happens.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.560]   If I try it on someone in person and it doesn't feel awkward and I don't see a distance in
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.920]   the conversation, I think it's a good technique.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.840]   Keep it in my, in my Google doc full of techniques for having better conversations.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.480]   Tell me what else is in the Google doc, right?
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.840]   You've got starting with, tell me you use pausing and interrupting people saying, because
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760]   let them continue.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.040]   What other tactics work really well in this conversational flow?
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.440]   The one that started the whole thing for me was I, for years felt really bad because I
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.080]   asked Jason free, the founder of base camp, how, how he failed when he failed.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.680]   And he just kind of looked away.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.960]   I still see him right now, as we're talking in my head, looking way and going, well, sometimes
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.800]   we just don't have any setbacks.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.200]   Some things just don't have that.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.520]   And then the more I push, the more he just acted, or I felt that he acted like I was
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.720]   an idiot who always failed and couldn't understand that sometimes people don't just, you know,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.680]   fall on their face when they're just trying to walk to the other end of the room.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.560]   Anyway, that ate it ate away at me that I asked him about his setback and he didn't
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   give me an example and I kept pushing.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.720]   And the more I pushed, the more he resisted.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.920]   So I hired an interview coach and I gave him that specific example.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.040]   I said, look, Jeremy, before we talk about anything else, I have to tell you about this
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   one problem.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.640]   And I told him, and he goes, Oh, my therapist had a situation like that, but tell me, goes
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.360]   my therapist had a technique called join the resistance says my therapist would have these
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.400]   men who would come into her office and she would say, Okay, tell me about the problem
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800]   you and your wife are facing.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.560]   And the husband would go, I don't have any problems, but you're clearly in here because
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.720]   you have a problem.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   There's an issue in the relationship.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.960]   It's not me, it's her, I don't have any problem goes in.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.280]   What are we doing here?
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.280]   I don't know.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.480]   She made me come.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.240]   And the more the therapist pushed, the more the person put up a resistance and then like
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.560]   sidestepped the whole problem.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   So Jeremy's therapist said she decided to join the resistance.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.720]   If she said, tell me about the problem you and your wife are having and the person said,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.560]   I'm not having any problem, you would say, Oh, must be good.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.600]   You know what?
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.560]   All I hear that people have problems must be good for you to just have an easygoing
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.200]   life without any problems.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Congratulations.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.760]   And then the person will go easy.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.040]   All she does is she keeps complaining to me and I don't know when we could spend time
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   together because my work is now taking up a whole lot of time and I've never had to
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.200]   work this many hours, let alone this late in my career.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.880]   Now they were off on a conversation that mattered.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.560]   And so Jeremy, my interview coach said, join the resistance.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.640]   Whenever you put, whenever you ask a guest a question and they resist, stop fighting
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   with them.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   Join the resistance.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.820]   Say something like, well, it must be great to have an easy, easy business.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.820]   Everyone else is struggling.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.840]   It must be great to have an easy time building your company when the rest of us are working
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.000]   really hard.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.120]   When I say that the person will immediately lash out at me and go hard.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640]   I mean, you think this is easy.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   You don't know.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.600]   Last night we were up because the servers were down and then somebody a week ago was
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.280]   complaining to me about the way that we are interacting at work and I, I'm trying to get
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.420]   work done, not talk about what their, what their interpersonal issues are.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.240]   Now we've got a real problem we can talk about.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.120]   So anyway, because the coach said, join the resistance and he gave me that phrase, I wrote
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.580]   it down in a, in a Google doc with that phrase and I said, Oh, I'm going to remember this
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.580]   because it has a name.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.420]   And so I started to, whenever I would have a new technique, I would give it a name and
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.340]   I'd add that technique to a Google doc.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.360]   I saw the list in the book where there's like a flow charts, the wrong word.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.520]   It's like a directory of tactics.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.840]   So there are plenty more for anyone listening who wants more than we'll get to today.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   But how do you think those techniques work when you're, you know, you talk about building
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.980]   yourself up, not making yourself seem needy and asking questions when you're interviewing
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.080]   for a job, or maybe you're doing references with someone's previous manager.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.500]   Can you still use those techniques to get people who are kind of more guarded with information
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   to share?
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.400]   I use it with people all the time.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   I think sometimes people are guarded because they're modest because they're not jerks.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.460]   So one technique that I had, I shared this when I had a, I used to in San Francisco have
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.780]   entrepreneurs come over for scotch at my office and they would just ask me all these questions
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.800]   and someone say, how do you get people to give you their numbers?
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.840]   And I said, well, what I do is I give them a dramatic low ball.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.420]   I said, what do you mean dramatic low ball?
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.260]   I said, I had this woman on, she wouldn't give me her, her revenue number.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.820]   So I said to her, and I knew that it was in, it was at least 10 million.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.900]   I said to her, do you think you'll hit a million soon?
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.060]   She goes a million, we're doing at least 10, 20 times that we're not trying to reach a
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.060]   million.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.420]   So anyway, I said that at scotch night and the guy goes, oh, that's such a good technique.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.520]   If you go dramatic, low ball, people feel insulted enough that they have to come back
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   at you.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.260]   Anyway, we started talking about other things and one where it's scotch night at my office,
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.340]   we're tasting different scotches, talking about what we're into.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.140]   And then at one point we got into running and the guy said, so how much do you run?
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.220]   I said, yeah, I run as much as I can here and there.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.260]   And the guy goes, Andrew, do you think you'll get to run a marathon sometime?
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.460]   He, and I go a marathon sometime.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.260]   I've run more marathons than I can count.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.260]   Literally.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.340]   There was one time in Washington DC, my wife left me at the top of rock Creek park and
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.700]   I just ran all the way down.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.780]   That was over 30 miles and there was no other way for me to get home except to run back
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.780]   to the house.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.300]   So a marathon is nothing for me.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.220]   And then he was smiling and others around the scotch table were smiling too.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.740]   And I couldn't understand why they were laughing at me.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.940]   At first I thought maybe they were laughing at me because that's not that much to run.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.820]   And then I realized he used dramatic low ball on me.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.780]   And so this works everywhere.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.780]   Yes.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.780]   It works in interviews.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.780]   Yes.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.780]   It works in private conversations.
