[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.240]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I've got something really special for you. If you had
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.160]   the opportunity to sit down for an hour with a man who started his business life with very
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.080]   few advantages, grew up in a poor farming town in central Florida, started his career as a plumber's
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.480]   assistant, and did poorly in high school, dropped out of college, but has gone on to become a
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.120]   respected member of the business community and a financially independent multi-millionaire,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.080]   would you jump at that chance? Well today, through the magic and power of podcasting,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.280]   I bring you just such a conversation and it's filled with little gems
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.480]   for you to consider to learn from and apply to your own life.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:19.200]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   Thank you for being with me today. Today I've got a good one for you, an interview with my friend,
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.400]   one of my personal, I hate the word mentor, but just a personal friend. It's a man I used to work
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.000]   for, a man named Warren Prescott, who has exactly that story. I sat down with him and was able to
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.440]   pull a little bit of the story out of him and then now I get to share it with you.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.040]   One of my goals with Radical Personal Finance has been to present a huge diversity of content.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   I've wanted to bring all kinds of topics to the show and I'm satisfied with some of the progress
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880]   that I've made toward that. I've worked hard to keep the guests diverse, to not talk about the
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   same thing over and over again. I've tried to bring all kinds of differing and disagreeing
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.120]   opinions and perspectives and give people an opportunity to share their ideas and perspectives
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   and then give you a chance to judge and to learn. I think we can learn something from just about
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.360]   anybody. Who was it? Emerson, right? Every man I meet is my superior in some way, something like
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.080]   that. I'm really great at remembering the essence of quotes while butchering the syntax. But the
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880]   point is I've tried to do that. I'll tell you that one of my disappointments for myself is I've
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.920]   brought a number of entrepreneurs on, but a lot of these entrepreneurs have had similar stories
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.640]   because they're from similar backgrounds. It is so easy for me to get a young entrepreneur
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.160]   who's built some sort of business in the tech space on the show. That type of person is easy
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.640]   for me to get on the show. I got lists of them everywhere. My email inbox is flooded with
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   propositions from these types of people. It's relatively easy for me to get authors or speakers
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.600]   of people with a podcast and a brand on the show, again, a couple emails every single day
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.760]   with inquiries of this type of person. But you know what? In your town, is that type of
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.400]   person, that avatar I just described, is that the common multimillionaire?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.440]   Or is the common multimillionaire in your town more likely to be somebody who has perhaps a few
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.840]   more years, is not necessarily on Skype all day, every day? Are they likely to be somebody who
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.400]   didn't start a web business and get rich in the last decade? Are they more likely to be somebody
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.120]   who just runs a large, solid business of some type? Well, in my financial planning career,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.200]   we financial planners want to work with the rich people. That's where we make the most money,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   generally. And so I learned who the rich people are, and the rich people are blue-collar
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.360]   business people. Go and study Tom Stanley's work, just blue-collar business people,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.720]   and they likely have brick and mortar stores, things like that. Now, there's nothing wrong
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.320]   with the transforming, changing world that we live in, but you got to recognize there's something to
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.160]   be learned from those who've been there, done it. So my intention from the beginning with Radical
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.880]   Personal Finance was to interview lots of these types of business people, and I've had a few on
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.920]   the show. But you know what? These people are tough to get to sit down for an interview.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.000]   Number one, they're tough because usually I need to do it in person. And also, they're tough just
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.240]   because they're busy or they don't want to talk on a microphone. They don't have anything to gain,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.320]   which here's a little secret for you. If somebody doesn't have something to gain,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.360]   they often don't want to tell anybody about what they're doing. So I share with you lots and lots
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.160]   of opinions and perspectives, and these are just not all from me. There are things I've learned
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.680]   from other people, but there are people who don't want to get on a microphone. For example,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   I know a number of very experienced real estate investors here in West Palm Beach,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.000]   and I've asked them, "Listen, can I get you on the show?" And I know their finances, and I know that
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.120]   they would have a lot of value to add, and they just, "I don't want to go on a show. I don't want
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.880]   to talk about anything." They're practicing, what's that concept? Stealth wealth. They don't
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.480]   have anything to gain from telling people how much money they have, so they don't really do it.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   Now, it's not to say that some people aren't willing. So my guest today, he is willing. He
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.680]   doesn't have anything to gain, doesn't sell anything that any of you can buy. He's just a
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.120]   friend of mine, and I used to work for him when I was a kid. But he has a lot to share, but still,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.520]   to get him to sit down and do the microphone, I had to work really hard for a really long period
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.640]   of time to get him to sit down for an interview. And even in that, you're going to have to listen
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:42.800]   through. He's an awesome guy. He's not a dynamic presenter. He didn't belly up to the microphone
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.840]   the way that I do with a big smile on his face, lots of enthusiasm and emotion in his voice. I had
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   to pull it out of him. But yet, this type of person can teach us so many gems, so much wisdom
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.360]   and knowledge. One of the things that I don't care for, a hallmark of my generation, I don't
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:13.120]   care for the way that we seem to ignore at the minor end and despise at the more harsh end people
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:21.280]   with age. It really frustrates me how in the US American society, we have a tendency to honor and
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.240]   revere and exalt the young and the beautiful. We have a tendency to shun and to avoid and ignore
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.880]   the aged and the ugly. But yet, don't the aged have something to share with us? I encourage,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.240]   if you have a grandmother or grandfather, I encourage myself. It's been too long since I've
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.680]   called my own grandmother. My grandmother is 101 years old, almost 102. And to my own shame,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.080]   it's been too long since I called her. So even as I begin the show, I'm reminding myself, but
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.640]   spend some time with people who have age and experience and learn from their wisdom,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.320]   learn from their experiences. And most definitely, if they have some financial wealth,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.240]   some financial independence and abundance, try to get them to share some with you. Just ask
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.560]   questions. I've had lots of friends of mine who have wanted to get on the show and they say,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:18.480]   "Listen, will you?" I ask them, "Will you come on the show?" And I'm trying not to overstate my
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.800]   case, but due to my experience and where I live, I know a lot of really wealthy people
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   and multiple, multiple people. "Listen, please, will you come on my show and share? I'll hide
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   your name. I'll hide your identity." "No, no, no, I don't want to." But they will sit down with me
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.400]   over lunch and talk to me and share with me. And so that's some of the content that I bring you.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.640]   Bit of a wordy intro here just to recommend to you that you take the time and also to say,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   "I'm working hard on getting this type of person on the show, but it's hard work for me to do it."
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.440]   It's a lot easier to get somebody who can sit down and talk with us over Skype.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.760]   But today's guest is a man named Warren Prescott. He started his, as you'll hear in the beginning
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.800]   of this interview, he started his as in a little rural town called Belgrade, Florida, which is
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   right here where I live in West Palm Beach. But Belgrade is the sticks. Even today, it is the
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.640]   sticks. If you've ever been to South Florida here, it's in Palm Beach County, but it's hard to get a
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   more different urban. It's not even urban. It's hard to get a more different environment. It's a
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.920]   farming town. And my guest today, he started as you'll hear with nothing in a little of a farming
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.560]   town, but he has been extremely successful and has built a really cool business. I worked for him for
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.880]   a total of two or three summers, depending on how I count it, and some time when I was in college,
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.680]   briefly. And so he's always had a special place in my mind, and I really admire and respect him.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.880]   And today I get to bring his story to you. Before I play his story for you, I just want to share one
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.680]   sponsor today. You're going to hear in today's show, Warren talk about the importance of savings.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.800]   And you're going to hear him talk about, as I try to pull out of him the threads of what made you
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.120]   financially successful. You'll hear him talk about, well, I just invested. But the first thing was he
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.680]   had to have savings. And you'll hear through and through from the beginning of his life that he was
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.880]   always a saver. Well, guess what? You got to have a little bit of money to make some money.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.720]   Now, you can start with your human capital and work and earn money, but then the first thing you
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.240]   got to do is save some. You got to pay yourself first. You got to save some. And the only way to
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   do that is to put a plan in place that results in you getting some money out of the spending column
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.640]   and into the savings column. And so sponsor today's show is YNAB. You Need a Budget. YNAB
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:42.160]   is the very best budgeting software that I know of. And it's the budgeting software that I use
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.920]   every day. And here's why it's so great. When you need to save money, you can put on there
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.800]   a savings category on your budget. If you have a goal, and if that goal involves money, as
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.280]   all goals do, a little tentative with that all because maybe there's something that doesn't
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.560]   involve money, but basically every goal involves money in some way, whether it involves money
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.120]   in some way, you need to have on your budget category at least some kind of reminder,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.360]   something. You need to do something towards that goal. For example, I have a budget category on
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.080]   mind for I'd like to buy an RV. And it's not appropriate right now, but at some point it will
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.680]   be. And I just have that on my budget category. And I fund that with a little bit of money here
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.960]   and there. It's not a major focus. It's too much of a consumption item right now while I'm still
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.360]   trying to build the empire with my investment items. But I still put it on there to remind
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.080]   myself, put a little bit of money into that account, put a little money into that account,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.000]   put a little money into that account. I challenge you to do the same thing. If you're not using YNAB,

[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.320]   how it really works. So radicalpersonalfinance.com/YNAB. Warren Prescott, welcome to Radical
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.960]   Personal Finance. Thank you very much, Josh. I've been looking forward to having you on the show
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:39.360]   because there's a bit of an age gap between us. I find it so easy to pin down the internet
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.720]   entrepreneurs, the young guys and gals who are out running around just doing things online,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.520]   but I really don't want to spend all my time interviewing internet entrepreneurs. I want to
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.680]   interview some entrepreneurs like you who've been there, done that for decades, but you guys are
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:01.040]   always so busy I can't pin you down in front of a microphone. Absolutely. So I wanted to get you to
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.880]   share a little bit of your story, specifically with business, because you've been involved in
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.640]   some businesses that fascinate me. So I'd love to know, where did you and your family start?
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.880]   You had a privileged upbringing, right? Started with loads of money, I'd imagine. Where did you
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:23.120]   guys get your start? No, I started out... Let me see here. I would say I started out when I was
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:32.720]   probably 17 years old. I started out working as a plumber's helper, a plumbing company in Belle
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:41.920]   Glade, Florida. I worked there for a couple of years and decided I'd always wanted to be on my
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:50.320]   own. I never really wanted to work for anybody, so I went to college for about a year and didn't
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.960]   care much about college. I wasn't a very good student, so when I come back, I started working
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:09.040]   for the plumbing company. I worked there a couple of years and I ended up taking my plumbing test
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.840]   after a couple of years and got my master plumbing license. I was self-employed for 10 years.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.920]   Working as a plumber? As a plumber, yeah. I did do plumbing and rough ends and things of that nature.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:32.640]   Of course, I'd met my wife. I was probably around 29 by then. I met my wife from West Palm and
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:42.000]   my lovely wife, Lulie. I wanted to change my life and get out of plumbing, so I started...
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.600]   I was from the Glades, knew a lot of people in the sod business, so I started a little sod company.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:58.240]   I actually borrowed $10,000 from a doctor friend of mine and started cutting Bahia sod
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.880]   there in West Palm off Southern Boulevard by Land Country Safari. I made some good money
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.440]   in it, so I said, "Heck, this is a job I want to do." I like the outdoors anyway,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.520]   so I had another buddy that was running a big sod farm and ranch in the Glades and he wanted me to
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   come cut grass there. What I did is I asked my wife at the time she was substitute teaching,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.400]   I asked her if she wanted to get in the sod business and I talked her into going
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   to her mother and borrowing $3,000 to start her company. I trained her and showed her how to do
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:50.880]   it and hired a guy that knew a lot about it. She oversaw that. By then, we had a couple of kids,
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:58.800]   so I'd get up in the morning, take the kids to school. She'd go to the sod farm and do her
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.040]   orders and stuff and then I'd go out into the Glades. I had another guy managing the farm in
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.280]   the Glades that I was cutting on and I started cutting sod out there. We did that for probably
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:22.560]   five years and I ran out of grass at this big farm. So, we started working together and decided
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:30.240]   that she needed to be a stay-at-home mom and I kept going with the sod business. In the meantime,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.320]   I'd invest in real estate. We'd both always saved our money and invest in real estate
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.760]   and I'd buy little tracts and sell them and do odds and ends.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:48.560]   - I want to ask you about the sod business and we'll go into kind of the real estate
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.800]   because you've got an interesting perspective on it, especially now.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.800]   Was it just from working in the plumbing business that you met some people who were in the sod
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:03.040]   business? How did you get the idea of that being your entrepreneurial endeavor?
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.680]   - Well, I knew I wanted to get out of the plumbing business.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.360]   - Why? What was driving you?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.600]   - I was tired of it after 10 years of it. I made great money and everything. I just
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.720]   didn't want to be a plumber all my life, so I switched into sod. I knew of several friends
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.640]   out there that had sod farms that had done very well in sod.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.560]   - Just basically explain the sod business. It all comes down to the margins? You just
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.920]   grow some grass and cut it out?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.960]   - Exactly. It's all volume. You sell it by the semi-load. We sold it to landscapers
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:41.760]   and we just sold semi-loads of grass. I got out and talked to people, met people,
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:49.200]   and sold it to different companies. It worked out well. I got along with everybody. It just
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.520]   happened.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.960]   - What was the foundation with the early part of the venture? Was it you going out and selling
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.960]   it? Was it your knowledge of the intricacies of the type of grass and how it worked? What
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.240]   was the thing that you did really well that led to it being successful?
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:13.040]   - More me selling it. Being able to go out and get the grass there at the right time.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.840]   Delivering it at the right place at the right time and doing what I said I'd do. That was
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:26.240]   the thing. A lot of people would take an order and not get it to the landscaper in time.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.680]   I was always good and prompt about getting it delivered on time. That's what did it.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.440]   Do what you say you're going to do.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.320]   - What was your secret to doing that? Were you a hands-on manager?
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.760]   - Absolutely. 100% hands-on. I'd hired a guy that knew the sod business. I really didn't
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.600]   know the sod business. I hired a gentleman in the glades who'd been in it for 30 years.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:58.960]   He knew it well. I went out there and worked every day. We had long hours. We'd start at
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.720]   six in the morning and work to eight, nine o'clock at night. After a few years, I knew
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.160]   about it as much as you could possibly know in it. That's where I ventured into that.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.080]   I just kept growing and growing. Eventually, I got in the golf course business.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:24.480]   That's where I'm at today. I do a lot of renovation on golf courses and stuff.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.000]   Of course, I bought my ranch. I bought several pieces of property,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   little ranches and bought them and sold them. I kept building up, saving my money until I
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.240]   bought a big one. I got a couple thousand acres now of my personal ranch. I lease probably 10,000
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.560]   acres of ranches now. - For hunting or just for fun or for grass?
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.040]   - For cattle. I'm big in the cattle business too now. I have cattle. I have hunting. I lease some
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:03.120]   of the hunting rights out to people. I'm still heavy in the sod and both in the Glades Inn and
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.040]   Okeechobee. - When you look back at your real estate
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.280]   investment career, what was the first piece of real estate you ever bought?
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:16.560]   - I bought a ... Well, I'd always been in real estate. Even when I was 17, I bought my first
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.800]   house, $11,000. - Really?
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.000]   - I paid for a little house, yeah. - Did you pay for it with cash,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.640]   a mortgage, or how did you buy it? - No, I paid cash for it.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:31.200]   I saved my money in the plumbing and I bought it. Paid 11,000. I kept it probably 10 years.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:40.240]   Sold it for, I think, 28,000. It worked out well. I liked that. It wasn't a big problem.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:47.200]   Renting it, only had one of them. Then later on, right after I got married, I bought a trailer
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   park and a motel. - Cash or did you finance those?
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:20:02.160]   - You know what? I'm pretty sure I paid cash for that because I'd already flipped the real estate
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.520]   and saved a pretty good amount of money. I had the motel, which was kind of a pain. I kept that
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.080]   for a couple years and I flipped that and made a nice little profit. After that, I went on.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:27.600]   Once I got married, I moved over to Wellington and then we bought a home in Lying Country Safari
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:36.480]   in Fox Trail. Then I started buying stuff in Wellington. I bought a 20-acre piece of
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:45.760]   land in Wellington in the horse country back there. This was in probably the early '90s.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:53.920]   Right when Wellington was starting to really crank up. Actually, I went to the bank and I
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:02.480]   was going to finance that. I talked to my banker and had the money set and ready to go. I told my
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:10.960]   wife one night I was going to buy 20 acres and she said I lost my mind. I had another older
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:19.360]   gentleman that worked with me. I asked him, I said, "You want to be a partner in a piece of land?"
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.280]   He said, "Yeah." I said, "How much money do you need?" I said, "None. I already got approved.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.560]   I'll just go ahead and buy it." I talked to a realtor and the realtor had told me if I buy it
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:36.640]   and hold it for a month that he'd be able to flip it. I bought it, paid $200,000 for it. I flipped
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:43.600]   it the next month for $300,000. I made $100,000, gave him $50,000. He didn't put a dime on it.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.240]   What did he do in the deal? Why did you even have him in the deal then?
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.000]   Because my wife didn't want me to do the deal. I wanted to do it. I went ahead and did it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.840]   She respected him a lot. He said he'd be the partner with us. That's how it worked.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:09.120]   We had a little argument over it, trust me. In 30 days, I did what I said I was going to do. I
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.920]   gave him half the profit. From that day on, I could have bought anything I wanted. He'd
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.040]   finance me in anything. We really never did any other deals other than that.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:26.480]   Over the years, do you have a strong conviction about always using your own money,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.040]   always borrowing money? How do you decide between using your own cash versus borrowing money?
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Well, on smaller stuff, I do. $300,000 deals, I do my own money. When I started buying ranches
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.720]   and stuff and getting up in the millions, then I'd get it from the bank and everything.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:56.480]   I did a couple of deals. Flipped it and made a lot of money. Worked out good. I still do it to this
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.760]   day. What's the best deal you've ever done? The one that you came away to say, "Man, I can't
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:10.400]   believe that worked out." I bought a 3,500-acre ranch. Is this here in Florida? Yeah. Okay.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:18.800]   Yeah. Up in the Port of St. Lucie area. Right before it was going to go crazy in the early
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:30.960]   '80s. No, it would have been in 2006 probably. I bought it and I kept it for a year. I flipped
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.640]   it and sold it for four times what I paid for it. That's awesome. Four times what you paid for it
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:47.040]   in one year. Who was the buyer? Was it a special deal? It was a big company out of the Carolinas.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.760]   I had to take on some partners on that. I had three partners and then myself. We all made
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:02.960]   well, just hit it perfect. What's the worst deal you ever made?
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.680]   I don't know. As far as real estate, I've really never lost any money in real estate.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   When the economy took a hit, we had already quit buying stuff. I bought a rock pit one time and
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:30.960]   I just sold it here in the last year or two. I lost money on that. It worked out. Some of you
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:37.120]   win, some of you lose. Did you expect the decline in real estate? Change in economy?
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   I knew it was coming. I got an old saying, "When the taxi driver tells you it's a good deal,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.560]   it's time to try to sell." That's what was going on. I think most people knew we were fixing to go
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:58.720]   into a bad economy in 2008 or whatever. I'd already had a couple of deals going. I couldn't
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.840]   get out of them as far as I'd bought it. We were getting them developed. We weren't developing.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.920]   We were actually getting the PUD on it. Then we were going to sell it to a developer. That's how
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.800]   I got caught with one piece of property. Your wife told me to ask you a question
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.440]   about the quail. Tell me the quail story. I think she's trying to throw you under the bus here.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:28.720]   I was always busy doing something. I raised quail when we first got married in about '84.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:40.960]   When I was a kid, I always raised quail. I always had wildlife. I bought 12,000 chicks and raised
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.680]   them up for a hunting preserve and ended up selling them to a hunting preserve, which was
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:56.400]   Bonnet Hunting Preserve. That was some of the hardest work I ever did. Real estate's always
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   been good to me. You're in Florida. Anybody that buys in Florida and buys a halfway right,
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   if they can hold on to it, they're going to be all right because everybody's going to eventually
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.880]   come to Florida until we're built out. That's the way I look at it now. I do think we're fixing to
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   go into an economy that's going to change year again and the next year or two. It's going to
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:25.440]   take a downward hit. Everybody needs to be prepared for it. What are you doing to prepare for that?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:33.200]   Well, I'm not really purchasing any land right now. I'm selling some pieces that I got. I got
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:43.440]   contracts on a couple of ranches that I have. The ranches are moving real good, but the value's gone
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.600]   up so much now. It's time to get out and do a little fishing, play a little golf.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:59.680]   I'm interested to know, how do you and your wife handle your business practices and your money?
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.800]   Because she is heavily involved in the business even, as you said. Do you guys work together?
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.960]   How do you guys handle that? Well, we're partners. I pretty much do
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.520]   most of the business stuff. We sit down and talk about things that we want to do.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.640]   I do have partners now that we work with because I buy bigger tracts of land now.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:35.520]   I think the biggest tract I ever bought was 7,000 acres. We do buy large tracts of land.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.000]   Right now, nobody's getting interest on their money. It's so cheap. Money's cheap.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:49.360]   Now's the time to borrow as long as you can make the payment on it. That's the thing. You got to
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:56.400]   be able to make the payment and still survive. How do you find a good business partner,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.520]   good investment partner? Well, through the years, I've dealt with a lot of guys.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:10.960]   We've become friends. I've never really had to go look and ask for anybody. I've always done
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:16.640]   good deals and people come to me and want to invest with me all the time. To me, it's kind
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.800]   of dangerous because you don't want to take somebody's money, invest in it, and lose.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:32.720]   It's hard to do. My people that I deal with are sound people. They understand the downwards
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:40.640]   part of what could happen. It will happen, but you just got to be able to hold on to it and
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.080]   wait it out. We don't go in and buy any commercial real estate or anything like that. We buy cheaper
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:57.520]   land. I don't like buying $25,000 acres. I don't do it. When you're analyzing a real estate deal,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.080]   are you a real number cruncher sitting down with a spreadsheet putting together comparable
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.000]   properties? Are you kind of just immersed in it and you get the feel? How do you actually
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.560]   analyze a deal? What are you using to make a decision? Well, I'm from the old school. I try
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:20.080]   to figure out a 5% or 10% return. I really don't look at anything I don't get 10% on.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   I just look at the deals. Now, my partner is a number cruncher. I find a deal. I take it to
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.280]   them. I tell them what I think. I've never been turned down on any deal I've ever done. I deal
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:44.080]   with some very sophisticated people that are sharp as they are in the country. I just know
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:51.520]   good deals when I see them. The thing now is I'm able to go and if I saw something I wanted to buy
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:57.760]   for $5 million a day, I could go tell somebody and put a deposit down on it and go buy. I'd call
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.520]   them up and say, "Hey, let's put the money together and do it." It'd be done. I've worked
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:10.320]   hard to get where I'm at on that. There's probably not a deal that I couldn't do if I wanted to do it
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:18.240]   as long as they agree. I've always made them money. I made them a lot of money in the past.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.280]   They all listen.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:29.920]   How in a normal week? I've always been interested. I worked for you when I was a kid.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.280]   Exactly, in high school.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.640]   You were a good worker. We all enjoyed you.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.880]   Thank you. I learned a lot and got exposed to some neat things when I worked for you.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.480]   In many ways, I always admired the type of business you seem to be in. It was always my
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.000]   dream to drive around in your pickup truck and do nothing all day except talk on the phone.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.840]   That was always what it seemed like to a youthful kid. I was like, "That's my dream of
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:04.720]   the kind of businessman I want to be." I'm interested to know, in today's world, from an
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.520]   experienced perspective, obviously it was different 30 years ago, but today,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.680]   what does your normal week look like? What do you actually do?
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:24.960]   I don't sleep very well. I get up early. Deals come to me all the time. People are always calling
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.640]   me with things. I don't know why, but they do. They call me about stuff all the time.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:41.920]   I get up and I work every day just like everybody else. I love it. I get up. I'm probably the
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:47.440]   happiest guy there is. I enjoy what I do. I enjoy the golf construction better than anything.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.800]   I get to deal with all the superintendents and stuff now. That's kind of my little pet peeve
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   right now. I'm doing several golf courses every summer. It's very rewarding as far as I'm concerned.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.760]   You get up early. Do you read the newspaper? Do you watch the news? What do you do?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.320]   I don't hardly ever read the newspaper anymore. I watch a little bit of news in the morning,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:20.000]   see what's going on. I have a plan of what I'm going to do that day because I've got so many
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.880]   things to do. You call me from time to time. I can't hardly meet up with you. I feel bad about it.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:37.440]   I'm always wheeling and dealing. It's kind of sad, but I do take off from time to time.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.960]   Right now, I'm getting a little older and I'm kind of going to slow down and let my daughter
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:49.280]   and my son-in-law run the company. I'm going to back down and just do my little play things,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.440]   which is real estate. I love real estate. That's what I do best.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:02.400]   So do you schedule a breakfast meeting three days a week with people? At this point in time,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.680]   the deals just come to you? No. I do have meetings all the time.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:18.880]   My life's a chaos, really. I'm not very organized. That's one thing I'd say. I'm not very organized
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.720]   on what I do. If somebody calls me on the phone, I go beat them then if I can, if I can't.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.920]   Just like with you, you call me three or four times. I'm always busy. I'm fixing to have to
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:40.880]   leave here in just a minute and go to interview an architect. How do you keep your business going
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.200]   if you're disorganized? What have you done to keep your business going to account for that?
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:53.760]   I do have people that are organized. You can hire these young people that got good worth ethics.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.320]   They're organized. You got to find somebody like that. You got to be organized now. You got to
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:08.720]   know your costs and everything. That's what I do now. But I used to work off a shoestring years
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:15.920]   ago. I didn't do a financial statement every week and whatever. I still don't do it. At the end of
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:22.160]   the year, I sit down and figure out what I've done. It's a nightmare for the accountant,
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:29.440]   but he understands me and he's been with me for 20 years. It must work. I always pay taxes,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.360]   so something must be right. That's a good thing. Do you set goals?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:46.960]   I did years ago when I was young, but now I'm on the cruise. I'm getting on up there now where I
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.280]   don't want to do all this stuff. I want to play a little golf and go fishing and hunting and do
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:59.760]   the things I've always wanted to do. Of course, I've always done that too. I've always taken time
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:08.640]   off of the family and done that. But now it's getting more aggravating for me to have to
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.320]   get out and do the hustle and bustles of everything. I guess I'm getting a little
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.760]   lazier in my old age. In fact, I know I am. How old are you now?
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.320]   I'll be 62 in June. When you look back, so to say 62, you must have gone to your
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   40th high school anniversary. You probably know some of your friends that you graduated
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.680]   from high school with out in Belle Glade. If you were going to look and see, what would you say
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.360]   would be, can you identify any character traits, personality traits, things you did differently
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.000]   than some of maybe your friends that you graduated from high school with that have led
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.160]   to a major difference in your lifestyle over the years?
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:58.160]   No, I was always motivated to work for myself. I never thought about working for anybody else.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.640]   That's what I'd recommend to anybody, be self-employed. I've just always been that way.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.800]   I never wanted to work for anybody. I've been fortunate enough that I did that. I've only
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.440]   worked for a couple of people in my whole life. I've worked for a lot of people now when I do
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:22.800]   golf courses and stuff. I get up and go when I want to and do what I want to do. It's like being
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:31.280]   retired as far as I'm concerned when it comes to that. I'll tell you, if you would have took a poll
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   of me in my high school days, most of my teachers would have probably told you I'd have been a
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:47.200]   definite failure. I was a terrible student. I was a C student if I studied. I mean, it was that bad.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:54.400]   I went to college. I went to a little small college in Georgia for about six months. I'd
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.040]   taken classes and stuff, but I just didn't like school. I was a terrible student.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:08.160]   I worked hard. My dad died when I was 18, and he taught us the work. As long as you got good
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:14.400]   work ethics, you can do it. But you got to have a goal, too, to say, "Hey, I want to have something
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:21.200]   one day." I'm not a nine-to-five guy with a job at Walmart or what have you. That wasn't never what
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:30.080]   I wanted to do. I just always liked trying to make money, and I saved it. You got to save it.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.280]   That was going to be my next question, was as far as saving money. Obviously, you were a saver.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.200]   From 17 years old, you said you bought an $11,000 house and paid cash for it for money you had
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:48.160]   saved. Two questions. Number one, how did you earn that money before you were 17 to be able to save
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.920]   it? Number two, did your parents teach you to save? What was the factor that caused you to feel
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:01.680]   that savings was important? My father always told us, "You need to save your money and spend it
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:11.520]   wisely," and all that. Actually, in high school, I took probably my junior year, I did what they
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.880]   called DCT, where you went and you took your main classes in school, your English, your math,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:22.560]   your history, and you'd get out a half a day. I had a job. That's where I worked for this plumbing
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:30.320]   company. I worked and I saved my money. Matter of fact, I was working when we did a place in
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:36.080]   Port LaBelle, Florida. I never will forget. It was a golf course community in LaBelle, Florida,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:43.920]   called Port LaBelle. I'd saved up $4,000. I wanted to buy a lot. They had some golf course lots over
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.240]   there. I asked my dad about it. This was before he got sick. He said, "Well, I'll tell you why."
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.520]   Because I had the money and the savings at the bank. He said, "You go to the bank. You need
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.880]   to start your credit. You need to learn how to have credit so you can deal with these banks in
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:09.920]   the future." He sent me to the bank, Bank of Belle Glade, Wayne Michaels. I told him what I wanted
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.680]   to do and everything. He said, "Well, being that you got the $4,000, I guess because I was so young,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.800]   you probably ought to just pay for the lot and not really borrow any money." He was probably
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:28.000]   nervous. Here I was probably 17 years old wanting to buy a lot. Who thinks about doing that at 17?
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:36.080]   I ended up buying the lot. I kept it a couple of years and I did sell it. Then after that,
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:44.880]   I bought the house. That's how it started. - How did you train your kids to handle money?
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:56.000]   - Well, I've spoiled them. They both manage money pretty well. Just through the years of seeing how
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.480]   we were always open with them, they never knew what we had totally, but they knew we went and
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:11.600]   did. We had a place in the Keys and we'd spend the summers down there. I guess it was bred into
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:17.440]   them to save, but they both save right to this day. They're just young, getting started now.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:24.480]   They're in their early 30s. They're starting. We don't try to give them a whole lot. They need to
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:32.400]   earn it themselves. It's worked out so far very well. - You say they need to earn it themselves,
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.200]   but you also said you spoiled them. Did you do something differently now than you did when they
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:44.160]   were younger? Did you do it differently when they were younger? - Well, they didn't get allowance.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.600]   If they needed something, we'd get it for them. They never asked for a whole lot. They always had
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:41:02.960]   pretty much. Just like the average family, I'd say now, for sure. I guess just hearing us talk.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.520]   We were always an open family about things. They had a question, we'd answer it. We had a question
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:14.560]   about them, we'd ask them. It's all open. Always been open. To this day, they got a question,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.800]   they ask. I give them my opinion, whether it's right or wrong. They understand that too.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:28.960]   But overall, I think it's worked out very well. - A few final questions here. You ever invest in
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:36.880]   stocks? - I have, and I've made a little money, and then I've lost a little money. I don't like
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   the stock market. I've got a saying that I'm not sending my money to New York. If I'm going to mess
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:49.280]   it up, I'll mess it up myself. I've stuck to that. I've seen a lot of people make money. I've seen a
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:55.360]   lot of people lose money. But I can invest my money as good as anybody can as far as I'm concerned.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:05.760]   That's why I buy term life insurance. Why am I going to spend it and let them invest my money?
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   I've borrowed money from life insurance companies that buy real estate. Why should I be borrowing my
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.160]   money as long as I can raise my own money and do it or have partners that do it?
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:26.320]   - Do you feel like your approach and your buddy's that you hang out with, go hunting with,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.840]   do you feel like, do they believe similarly to you? They're going to invest their own money,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:37.280]   or do you find that you're unique in that regard? - Well, most of them that, you know,
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:44.000]   I'd say the most guys I run around with are probably self-employed, but most of them don't
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:55.280]   move like I did. I don't know why, but not a lot of people jump out and invest like I did. I was
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.760]   always able to do it because I had a backup in case, you know, if I bought a piece of land I
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.600]   couldn't afford it, I always could afford it. I never bought anything I couldn't afford.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:10.720]   So it never put me in a bind. The worst thing that could ever happen to a couple is not having
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.240]   enough money to make ends meet, pay the bills at the end of the month or the first of the month.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:26.960]   That's where these marriages go sour, as far as I'm concerned. We just managed our money and
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:35.920]   we never really had a money problem because we just saved. - When you look at my generation
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:46.160]   and you kind of think about our future, do you look and say, "Man, these guys are really
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.880]   doing things well," or do you look and say, "Man, they got some problems"? What advice,
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.480]   like, how do you perceive it? What do you see people doing that you think they should, you know,
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.400]   if you could give words of advice, let me rephrase it this way, if you could give words of advice to
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.560]   guys like me, just based upon your experience, people that work for you and your experience
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:12.080]   with the kids, friends and things like that, what do you see that people aren't grasping that
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:18.560]   you believe is important? - Well, the worth of it, you know, people don't want to work. They think,
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.600]   you know, I mean, if you notice, everybody drives a brand new car and got a big old car payment.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:32.400]   I mean, I drove my car for 10 years and never thought anything about it, you know? And people
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:39.120]   are much more intelligent than they were back in my days. To me, it appears that way. I mean,
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.280]   these kids nowadays are brains, you know, they can do anything, but they want to make it too quick
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:52.800]   and they think it's easy and that's why you have a lot of bad things happen with, let me see how I
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.640]   wish to phrase this, you know, people don't want to wait. These young people don't want to wait
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:05.600]   their turn, you know? Wisdom, being older and wiser really matters. And I mean, even though I
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.520]   started out young, you know, I hung around with a lot of older people. I had a veterinarian doctor
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:18.320]   that I dealt with and I did plumbing for him and, you know, I mean, I always worked hard. You got to
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.520]   work hard if you're going to make it. As far as I'm concerned, you can't rely on somebody else to
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.840]   do it for you. And I mean, I got up my, to this day, I can go run any piece of equipment I got.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:36.400]   I mean, I do. I mean, heck, I get on a tractor and mow, that's my therapy, going out every morning
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:43.520]   on a pasture, you know, getting away from the phone and just relaxing, you know? And, you know,
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:52.480]   to me, not everybody's, you know, qualified to go to college. Everybody goes to college now.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:57.440]   There's people that should be in college that need to, you know, be electricians or things like that
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:05.280]   or what have you. I would recommend all these young people, you know, start up something,
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:11.200]   but stay with it, you know? I see them where they get bad credit right off. That's the worst thing
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.320]   you could ever do. If you go to the bank, you borrow money, you better be willing to pay it
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:22.960]   back because the first time you get bad credit, it's a nightmare. They'll ask you. I remember one
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:29.760]   time years ago, I had a Sears. I bought something for my mother after my father passed away and I
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:36.000]   missed the payment at Sears Ropa. That thing haunted me for 20 years. I mean, on your credit
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.760]   report, they put it down there, even though I paid for it and paid it off because I was late that one
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.360]   time when I'd go and borrow money from a bank, you know, for a line of credit for, say, my plumbing
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:53.920]   company or whatever. They'd always ask me about that thing. It was amazing. I couldn't understand.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:02.080]   It was probably a $30 a month payment and, you know, I just missed it one time by probably over
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.680]   looking it because I definitely had the money, but it haunted me. I never will forget that
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.160]   because, I mean, I probably had two or three banks that asked me. Even when you go borrow a car,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.880]   they look up your credit and they'd say, "Well, what happened with this payment here on this one?"
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   You know, you'd have to—I mean, I was wondering if I was ever going to get that off.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:28.160]   Your credit's very important. Your words are very, very important. If you tell somebody you're going
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:34.880]   to do it, you better do it or you'll get a bad name and it travels, you know. To me, it does.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:41.120]   I try to do whatever I tell you I'm going to do. I try to do it, you know. I'm bad about my
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:49.760]   appointments. - Do you think you'll ever retire? - No. I mean, I'm talking about now slowing down,
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:59.200]   but no. I love the art of the deal, man. I live for it every day. I get up and got up this morning,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.400]   I was just as happy as a lark knowing that I'm going to go out there and wheel and deal somewhere
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:12.560]   and do something. I mean, it's like a big game, really. As long as you don't jump off in quicksand
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:22.080]   getting something you can't handle. But no, overall, I love it. I wouldn't change anything
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:29.120]   about what I do. I'll tell you that now. I don't spend time with my buddies and go play golf like
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:35.440]   I want to. I can go play golf at all the courses in the county and I love golf. I'm just so busy
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.320]   right now. That's what I kind of miss right now because all my buddies are playing, they call me
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:47.760]   all the time. I can't go because I'm doing something. - You're working. - Yeah, I'm working.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.640]   That's it. I love it. - Warren, thanks for coming on. I really appreciate it. - Thanks a lot. I
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:59.840]   appreciate it. - Three major lessons I want you to learn from the story that Warren shared with us.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:07.040]   Number one, savings comes... Let me rephrase that. That's going to be number two. Number one,
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:13.520]   hard work is mandatory. Warren isn't kidding. You haven't known him, haven't watched him,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.440]   hard work is mandatory. Now, I've seen him coming along after the fact. I came along after he had
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:26.240]   done pretty well and he certainly likes his toys, but hard work is the foundation. If you don't have
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:32.800]   that work ethic, it's going to be very difficult to build wealth. Number two, savings and capital.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:40.720]   You've got to have savings and capital. So if you don't have any money, go to work and get some.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:48.400]   It's mandatory. You've got to have savings and capital. Now, notice the trend that I have pointed
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:55.600]   out, that he maintained control of that savings. He has had the ability to invest it into various
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:04.320]   operations that he's had control of. The IRA wasn't the magic ticket. It was the savings and
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:10.640]   control of it. And then finally, point number three, notice that he invested in terms of an
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.000]   appropriate scale. I need to do this show. The title of it is written... I mean, I can give you
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.080]   the... Here's the 10-second version. You have to always apply the lens of scale to your investment
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.880]   activities. Very popular, very important show that I did. I forget the exact title, but in the past,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.960]   search the archives, it was lens of scale, applying the lens of scale to what you do,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.560]   but you've got to apply it to the investments. There's a stage at which buying and flipping a
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:42.240]   $4,000 lot is really useful. And that $4,000 lot can lead you into buying and selling an $11,000
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:50.080]   house. But then there's a stage at which you do $3,500 acre deals. And once you reach a certain
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:56.560]   stage of wealth, buying and flipping an $11,000 lot, it doesn't do much for you. You got to find
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:02.800]   those bigger deals. So the key is to learn and practice the principles when you're small,
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.920]   so that you're ready for that next stage. But if you don't have any money, I mean,
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.360]   hey, if you can put these deals together, fine. But if you can go out and find a $3,500 acre ranch
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.680]   and you don't have any money and your flat broke, you can put together some partnership deals and
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.600]   you can make that work, go for it. You call me and tell me you did it and I'll interview on the show
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.680]   and we'll share that with others. All right? I'll believe it when I get the email and the call and
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.360]   I see the check that you did, that you put together. But until that time, here's my
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:40.000]   recommendation. Start small. Start where you are with what you got. Teach your kids to buy an old
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.480]   bicycle and flip it up. That's going to be fix it up and then flip it. Buy an old car for a couple
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.040]   of thousand bucks, paint it, flip it, clean it up and flip it. Keep your eye open on the side of the
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:57.840]   road for, I don't know, I bought a trailer one time, this big old 20s, huge trailer. I could
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.000]   barely pull it at the time. It was so big, but I bought it cheap and I fixed it up and cleaned it.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.960]   I think I doubled it. I think I bought it for like $1,500 and I sold it for three grand,
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.920]   something like that. So it worked out. Keep an eye out for those little deals. When you see a little
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:19.200]   piece of real estate, a little $4,000 a lot, go ahead. Buy the house, flip the house. Look for
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.760]   something that's appropriate to you. Keep your eye out for those business deals that are around you.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:30.960]   Some of you guys, I mean, sod, kind of a strange business, right? But Warren saw the business. He
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.800]   saw the opportunity and got involved and he's a huge sod farmer here in Florida.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   So look for those opportunities around you. You can do this with kayaks or sod or fishing boats
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.720]   or tractors or skyscrapers. It doesn't matter. It's all the same. It's all the same as far as
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.080]   the fundamentals. Yeah, it's a little bit different. You got to go in line with the market,
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   find there's a demand. But ask you a question. With what Warren described, if you pulled him
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:02.800]   out of South Florida and put him somewhere else in the country or in the world, do you think he'd do
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:10.720]   about the same thing he's done? I'll let you answer that question. Thank you all for listening
