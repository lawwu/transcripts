[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460]   We end the week talking about covenants. Yes, covenants. We need to. In the
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.760]   words of one recent book on the topic, "The covenants are not the central
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.020]   theme of Scripture. Instead, the covenants form the backbone of the Bible's
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.880]   metanarrative, and thus it is essential to put the covenants together correctly
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.640]   in order to discern accurately the whole counsel of God." Those are the words of
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.020]   Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellam. So covenants are a sort of skeletal
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.620]   structure, and we must put them together rightly. And to explain covenants and how
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.500]   they work, I called Dr. Don Carson on occasional Fridays to call him up as
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760]   part of our relationship with our friends at the Gospel Coalition. Carson
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.000]   is the co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition, and he's the editor of
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.560]   the NIV Zondervan Study Bible, which is the study Bible version of what we're
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.060]   doing in these occasional Friday podcasts. So what is a covenant, and how
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.960]   do they hold our Bibles together? Here's Dr. Carson to explain. Christians know, of
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.480]   course, that the Bible is made up of two Testaments. They may wonder from time to
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.680]   time where the word "Testament" comes from. It comes from two passages in the New
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.680]   Testament, one in Hebrews and one in Galatians, where actually the word is
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.200]   properly rendered "covenant." It would be easier, it would be more accurate to speak
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.360]   of the Bible as having two covenants, the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. Of
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.840]   course, we've inherited the term "Testament," so we'll continue to speak of
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   the Bible having two Testaments, but the notion of covenant shapes an
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.120]   awful lot of how the Bible is put together, rather than "Testament." Again, we
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.880]   should begin in Genesis 1, 2, and 3 in the Garden of Eden. The word "covenant"
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.440]   isn't used there. But one of the striking things that we've already seen part of
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.520]   about Genesis 1, 2, and 3 is that those chapters lay a kind of seedbed of
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.960]   notions that are developed in much richer detail farther on in the Bible.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.240]   The Bible doesn't talk of God as King in those chapters, but he's clearly reigning.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.320]   The Bible doesn't talk about the Church in those chapters, but there's the
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.560]   beginning of his own elect covenant people. The Bible doesn't really talk
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.400]   about blood sacrifice in those chapters, but nevertheless, the covering that God
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080]   provides for Adam and Eve depends on the death of an animal. The Bible doesn't talk
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   about the Trinity, yet you have these strange expressions like "Let us make men
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.880]   in our image." And in the same way, the Bible certainly doesn't speak of
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.680]   covenant there, yet there is in some sense what some theologians have called
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.480]   a covenant of words. Probably the best defense of the notion that covenant is
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   introduced in these chapters is the book by Michael Horton called Covenant and
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.520]   Eschatology. In any case, there is an agreement made by a sovereign, in this
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.760]   case God, with human beings where there is worship and adoration on one side, and
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.080]   blessing and protection and privilege granted by God on the other side, on
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.960]   condition of certain obedience, with threat of certain judgment if there is
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.320]   disobedience. That's the setup for the horrible drama of chapter 3, where
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.200]   human beings choose defiance and disobedience and die, die in multiple
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.680]   ways. I suppose, however, the first covenant that people fasten a lot of
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.200]   attention on is the Abrahamic covenant. But before we get there, there is the
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.800]   the Noahic covenant, or sometimes it's pronounced the "Noahic" covenant, the
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.840]   covenant with Noah. After God destroys the world with water, with only eight
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.480]   human beings left alive to repopulate the earth again, he promises in grace not
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.320]   to destroy the world again by water. The next destruction of the world will be by
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.760]   fire at the end of the age. That's a theology that is picked up in 2 Peter.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.720]   But in this case, God makes a covenant that is sealed by a public sign, namely
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.520]   the rainbow. The rainbow takes on that covenantal significance. The Abrahamic
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.480]   covenant is much more complicated. It's sometimes called a covenant of promise.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:40.360]   It turns on several chapters. First of all, Genesis chapter 12, "The Lord said to
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.720]   the Lord had said to Abram, 'Go from your country, your people, and your father's
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.200]   household to the land. I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.160]   will bless you. I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.680]   bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse. And all peoples
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.560]   on earth will be blessed through you.'" Now the word "covenant" isn't used there, but
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.560]   there there is a flat-out blessing from God with promise not only to Abraham, but
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.840]   through Abraham to all the peoples on earth who will be blessed through him.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:24.520]   That's chapter 12. Chapter 15 has a dramatic scene. There, God establishes
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.640]   his covenant with Abram. We read, "After this the word of the Lord came to Abram
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   in a vision. 'Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.'" Then
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.080]   there's a lot of talk about God's promise that he will provide a son and
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.280]   an heir and an inheritance. And we're told, verse 6, "Abram believed the Lord, and he
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.600]   credited it to him as righteousness." Then by the end of the chapter there
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.640]   is this dramatic scene that the first part of the chapter introduces. In this
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.120]   scene, in a vision, as the sun is setting, Abram falls into a deep sleep and a thick
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   and dreadful darkness comes over him. And the Lord promises some things that will
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.400]   take place in the future. And when the sun has fully set and darkness has
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.080]   fallen, there is a smoking fire pot with a blazing torch that appears and passes
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.040]   between animals that have been cut up. And this symbolism derives from
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.960]   curses in the day. Sometimes a sovereign state, a regional superpower, would enter
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.880]   into a covenant with a vassal state. In fact, it would be an imposed covenant, but
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.960]   it would be cast after a sort of historical preamble. It would be cast
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.320]   into the mode of mutual promise. The regional sovereign promises protection
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.640]   and security and blessing and prosperity, and the vassal state promises obedience,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.040]   paying taxes on time, not rebelling, and that sort of thing. And then there's a
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.920]   mutual curse. "Let this be done to me and more also if I should break this covenant."
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.520]   What it means, in fact, is that the curse falls on the lower member, on the
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.880]   vassal state. In other words, if the vassal state rebels and tries to make a
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.120]   political tie with some other regional power, there will be terrible judgment
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.620]   that follows. And in the symbolism of the cut animals, the two parties then are
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.280]   supposed to walk between the cut up animals, and implicitly they're saying,
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.600]   "Let this be done to me. Let my body be cut up and trashed if I were to
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   break this covenant." But in this vision slumber of Abram, only the fire pot that
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.920]   represents God goes between the two animals, as if God himself takes on the
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:57.360]   entire curse all by himself. That's chapter 15. In chapter 17, the covenant is
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.840]   sealed by the sign of circumcision. And then in chapter 2 of Genesis, in the
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:11.080]   the testing of Abraham, the almost sacrifice of Abram's son, after God stops
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.200]   Abram from killing the boy, "Do not lay a hand on the boy," the voice from heaven
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.800]   says. The angel of the Lord speaks, "Do not lay a hand on the boy. I know that you
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:28.680]   fear God." And Abraham eventually calls that place, "The Lord will provide." And to
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.560]   this day it is said, "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided." And then
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.920]   the angel of the Lord calls Abraham from heaven a second time, and God through him
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.120]   swears, "Because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.360]   I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.920]   the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.360]   the cities of their enemies, and through your offspring all nations on earth will
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.560]   be blessed because you have obeyed me." That's the same blessing and promise
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:08.640]   that goes all the way back to chapters 12, 15, and 17. Now, it's possible to
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.600]   configure these chapters a little differently. For example, there's an
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.240]   excellent Australian scholar called Paul Williamson, whose book, "Sealed with an
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.960]   Oath, Covenant and God's Unfolding," thinks of two covenants here rather than just
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.040]   one, but the detail is not nearly as important as seeing how this Abrahamic
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.040]   covenant, or these Abrahamic covenants if you prefer, are fulfilled in the New
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.600]   Testament. This promise that through Abram's seed all the nations of the
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.280]   earth will be blessed is picked up in spectacular display, especially in
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.440]   Galatians chapter 3. And the fulfillment is found in the ultimate seed, Jesus
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.200]   Christ himself, who brings blessing to all the peoples of the earth as promised.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:59.480]   So that's the Abrahamic covenant. Then a covenant is made with the people of God
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.280]   as a nation in Exodus, and this is the one that is sometimes referred to in the
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:11.160]   New Testament as the Old Covenant. It's the covenant that predominates in day-to-day
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:17.920]   existence amongst the Israelites for much of their national existence. After
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.000]   God pulls the people out of the land of slavery, that's the presupposition of the
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.440]   covenant. God saves the people first and then enters into a covenant with them.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.160]   We're told, Exodus chapter 19, on the first day of the third month after the
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.640]   Israelites left Egypt, on that very day they came to the desert of Sinai. And
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:45.280]   there Moses goes up to the Mount of God. God calls him and says, "This is
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob, and what you are to tell the
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.680]   people of Israel. You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.440]   carried you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself. Now if you obey me fully
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.440]   and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.600]   possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.640]   priests and a holy nation. These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.760]   And the same order of things is found in the next chapter, the Ten Commandments,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.160]   the high point of this covenantal structure. But the presupposition is,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.960]   again, that it's imposed by God, who has brought people out of the land of Egypt.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.680]   God spoke all these words. Exodus 20, "I am the Lord your God,
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.120]   who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. Then you begin, you shall
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.040]   have no other gods before me," and so forth. Chapters 21, 22, 23 are the so-called
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.800]   Holiness Code. And then you get to chapter 24, and the covenant is confirmed.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:58.160]   So much of the Old Testament is bound up with the importance of the Sinai
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.080]   Covenant, as it's sometimes called, or the Old Covenant, or the Mosaic Covenant,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.200]   because Moses was the mediator. And what is very clear about that covenant is
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.600]   that it is profoundly conditioned by obedience. "You will be my people if you
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.880]   obey me." And in the book of Deuteronomy, where the book is structured as a series
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.320]   of addresses by Moses to the people before he dies, and they are on the edge
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.960]   of entering into the Promised Land, the structure, the language of the book is a
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.520]   kind of renewal of the covenant. It's the establishing once more of the
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.560]   Mosaic Covenant. It's the book of the covenant in many, many respects.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.960]   And that's all before you even get out of the Pentateuch. Then a further
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.720]   covenant is established with David and the inauguration of the Davidic dynasty.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.960]   We'll come back to that in a later session, but that's really important as
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.680]   well, with promises that are given to David about great David's greater
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.760]   son. God will ensure that there is a David-ide, someone from the line of David
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.960]   who is sitting on the throne, and ultimately he will be called the
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.320]   wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.920]   That's from Isaiah chapter 9, of course, words we sing every Christmas in
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.480]   the glorious music of Handel's Messiah. But the base promise of that is
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.720]   found in 2 Samuel chapter 7. Then we'll skip over that to the promise of the new
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.120]   covenant, and that shows up in several Old Testament passages, not least
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:39.680]   Jeremiah 31, also in Ezekiel chapter 36, and elsewhere. So that already God is
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.600]   promising, centuries before Christ, that the old covenant, that is the covenant
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.560]   with Moses, won't last forever. Indeed, the writer of the Hebrews spells the
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.760]   argument out in Hebrews chapter 8 very powerfully. After quoting Jeremiah 31, "I
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.600]   will make a new covenant in those days." It will not be like the old covenant.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.640]   It will be a new covenant, and then he spells out the particulars by
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.640]   which it will be characterized as new. Then the writer to the Hebrews says, in
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.080]   Hebrews chapter 8 verse 13, "By calling the old one old, he has essentially made
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:22.480]   it obsolete and passing away." He's promising a new covenant. And that's six
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.640]   centuries before the coming of Christ, when already there is promise of a new
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.680]   covenant, which raises, of course, all kinds of questions about how the old one
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.640]   will relate to the new one. What things will continue, what things won't continue.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:42.840]   For example, according to Jesus in Mark's Gospel, Jesus made certain foods clean.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   That's in contradistinction to the stipulations of the old covenant. We'll
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.560]   come back to those points later in this series as well. But there are points of
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.160]   continuity between the old covenant and the new covenant, and there are points of
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.640]   discontinuity. So now with this multiplicity of covenants, you begin to
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.040]   see how they point forward to the new covenant with Jesus in different ways.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:10.080]   The Abrahamic covenant points forward to the new covenant by promising a seed
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:16.360]   that would bring blessing to the whole earth, and by making of Abraham a
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.960]   prototypical figure of faith, he becomes the father of those who share his saving
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.520]   faith. That argument is worked out, for example, in Romans chapter 4. And the old
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.960]   covenant establishes all kinds of structures of right and wrong and
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.240]   blessing and curse and the importance of obedience, but it does not have intrinsic
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.040]   power to transform. That's not the way the old covenant is structured, the
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.120]   Mosaic covenant is structured. But on the other hand, it establishes many
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.800]   precedents and structures. For example, it's under the terms of the old covenant
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.440]   that the Ark of the Covenant, as it's called, becomes really important, on
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.960]   which the blood of bull and goat is sprinkled. And this is the place of the
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.480]   tabernacle, the meeting place between God and human beings. It's the
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.080]   organizing of the people of God into a nation-state, a covenant people, a kingdom
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.360]   of priests. And all of these things become structures that point forward
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.880]   to and anticipate the covenant people of God when Jesus says, "I will build my
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   assembly, I will build my church." He comes as the messianic covenant maker. Now,
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.400]   there are some people who look at the promises of the new covenant in Jeremiah
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.640]   31 and parallels, and say that what is promised is merely the renewal of the
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.160]   covenant. And I would say that that they're partly right. That is, there are
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.500]   some elements of the covenant that are being renewed, but nevertheless the
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.720]   language of Jeremiah 31 is very explicit. It will not be like the old covenant in
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.200]   certain particulars that we don't really have time to detail. And that's the
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.400]   language that Hebrews 8 picks up very explicitly. It's the promise of a
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   new covenant that makes the old one obsolete and passing away. If the
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   promise were merely of a renewed covenant, then it would be an improper
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.360]   inference to draw that the old one is becoming obsolete and passing away. And
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.920]   then, of course, when you come to the passion narrative, at the Last Supper
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.880]   Jesus takes the cup and says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood." And
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.800]   Hebrews works this out in detail to make it clear that Jesus is the mediator of a
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.480]   new covenant, and he's entering into a better tabernacle, and his sacrifice is
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.880]   complete and once for all and doesn't have to be repeated year after year. And
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.520]   as the mediator of this new covenant, he is able to save to the uttermost all
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.200]   those who come to God by him, precisely because his sacrifice was once for all
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.640]   and does not need to be repeated, and his blood is utterly sufficient in this
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.960]   respect. Now, there are many other things that could be said along these lines.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.120]   John's Gospel doesn't use the word "covenant," for example, but it is replete
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.480]   with covenant themes. There is the promise of land connected in the Old
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:19.800]   Testament covenant with Abraham, and Christians have disagreed on exactly how
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:27.640]   those covenantal promises are fulfilled. But one of the recent books in the New
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.840]   Studies in Biblical Theology series, the book by Oren Martin, Bound for the
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.120]   Promised Land, argues pretty strongly that the ultimate fulfillment is in new
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.880]   heaven and a new earth. It's more than just the land of Israel, not less. And
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:50.760]   likewise, there are some differences amongst Christians as to exactly the way
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:57.640]   the new covenant fulfills the old, but those debates need not detain us here.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:05.680]   What is important for our purposes is that this drama of unfolding covenants,
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.120]   and I haven't listed all of them, this drama of unfolding covenants finally
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.880]   brings us to the renewal of the covenant in the Lord's Table, and the
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:21.360]   covenantal seal of baptism, which is held by both Baptists and Paedobaptists.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.320]   They interpret it a little differently, but nevertheless, there is the
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:32.000]   covenantal seal of baptism that marks out the people of God. And so we are
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.240]   to see ourselves now as people of the new covenant, in continuity with the
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:45.360]   covenant of grace pronounced to Abraham, in fulfillment of the covenant of law
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.520]   that's worked out with Moses and that Sinai, with typological fulfillments and
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.720]   explicit fulfillments, now at the end of the age, in the fullness of time,
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.200]   until we finally land in the new heaven and the new earth, the home of
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.800]   righteousness, the end of all the covenantal promises. Amen, that is so good.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.280]   From his home office, that was Dr. Don Carson, the co-founder and president of
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.480]   the Gospel Coalition. And for more on these covenants, the covenant with Noah
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.200]   and the covenant with Abraham, and then the Mosaic covenant, the Davidic covenant,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.080]   and the new covenant, see Paul Williamson's very good essay at the end
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.640]   of the NIV Zondervan Study Bible, which was edited by Dr. Carson himself.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.440]   Speaking of theology, on Monday we return with Pastor John, and a listener wants to
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.120]   ask this, "Is an unlimited atonement more glorious than a limited atonement?" And if
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.840]   that question seems foreign, we'll explain it a bit on Monday and Pastor
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.400]   John will answer it. Thanks for listening to this special episode of the Ask Pastor
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   John podcast with Dr. Don Carson. I'm your host Tony Rehnke, we'll see you on Monday.
