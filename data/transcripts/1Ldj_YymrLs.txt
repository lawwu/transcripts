[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.460]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.500]   We are recording this episode
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.960]   in the midst of a pandemic shutdown
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.180]   of our cities and our states,
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.100]   recording right now from home.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.740]   And neither of us have gathered
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.460]   with our local churches for weeks now,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.500]   and this episode is scheduled to launch
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000]   sometime in early May.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.140]   So it's a question about church dress codes,
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.440]   and neither of us know, by the time this episode launches,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.900]   if we will still be quarantined
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.280]   or if we'll be meeting in person on Sundays
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.380]   with our churches.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.140]   In any case, churches in this country
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.040]   will eventually reunite.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.760]   We trust the Lord in that.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.260]   And to prep for that meeting,
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.100]   we have a question from John,
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.980]   a listener in South Carolina, who writes this.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.020]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.220]   When we join in corporate worship
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.260]   and gather in God's house,
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.940]   should we dress in our best clothes?
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.180]   I tend to say yes.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.880]   The world seems to dominate our choices
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.740]   in too many ways in our worship,
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.320]   in our music, building styles, flippancy, et cetera.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.260]   Under the old covenant,
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.460]   Moses was clear that priests should wear holy garments
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.740]   that were elaborate.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.180]   That's Exodus 28, verse four.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.380]   In entering the presence of God through Christ,
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.700]   it seems to me the modern church
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.580]   has settled for casual Fridays,
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.000]   a dress code from the corporate world.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.020]   Do you know of any scriptures in the New Testament
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.160]   that address appropriate attire for a church?
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.700]   Pastor John, what would you say to John?
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.500]   Yes, but maybe not in the way you think.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.180]   (both laughing)
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.500]   But let me set it up.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.620]   Whether you dress to kill on Sunday morning,
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.660]   or dress to kill those who dress to kill,
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.100]   or whether you close your eyes earnestly
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100]   while singing the doxology,
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100]   or casually sip your latte while singing "Holy, Holy, Holy,"
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.520]   or whether you sit with respectful posture
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940]   or slouch with indifference,
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.220]   or whether you keep your hands to yourself
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.160]   or rub the back of your boyfriend's neck
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.820]   while the pastor pours out his heart,
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.660]   or whether you disdain a shabby visitor
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.220]   or rejoice that they are welcome,
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.220]   all these things and many more are shaped and guided
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.240]   by your vision of what God is like in this service
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.540]   and what is at stake here,
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.780]   what you believe should be happening here.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.220]   So let me lift up some biblical descriptions
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.980]   of God and his ways,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.540]   which I think if they came to us with appropriate weight
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.560]   and wonder and joy and awe,
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.180]   we would discern more clearly how to dress
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.180]   and act in worship services, corporate worship.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.940]   In other words, I think tinkering externally
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.460]   with how we dress does not come close
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.320]   to the heart of the matter that plagues the church today.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.380]   The problems are far deeper than that.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.980]   Certain kinds of behaviors and clothing
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.980]   are simply symptomatic of views of God and worship
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.660]   and ourselves that are at best lopsided
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.220]   or worse, unbiblical.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.300]   So here they are.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.260]   Number one, let our demeanor and dress reflect
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.060]   the transcendence and imminence of God,
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.260]   the majesty and the intimacy of God.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.260]   Isaiah 57, 15, "Thus says the one who is high and lifted up,
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.700]   "who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.700]   "I dwell in a high and holy place,
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.820]   "and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit."
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.820]   So I would ask, has the swing, say in the last 40 years,
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.020]   from formality in church to casualness in church
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.020]   captured a mature balance
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.860]   between transcendence and imminence?
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.540]   I think the answer to that is no, by the way.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.380]   (Rhett laughs)
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.820]   And I mean, that's not fair,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.380]   because I don't mean to paint with a big brush.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.540]   Many churches, I would say, no.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.740]   And I would just ask everyone who's listening
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.220]   to consider for themselves and their church,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.880]   especially pastors, what about my church?
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.740]   Don't point your finger at others.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.900]   Number two, let our demeanor and dress
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.900]   reflect the severity and kindness of God.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.260]   Romans 11, 22, "Behold the kindness
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.620]   "and the severity of God."
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.820]   Severity toward those who have fallen,
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.060]   but God's kindness to you,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.900]   provided you continue in his kindness,
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.980]   otherwise you too will be cut off.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.020]   Now, God is not to be trifled with.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.740]   He is not mocked.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740]   He is more severe and more kind than we can imagine.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.180]   And there is a demeanor that flows
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.580]   from a sober experience of the mingling
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.460]   of these two realities,
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.060]   especially as we come into worship face-to-face,
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.080]   corporately, with this God.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.540]   Number three, let our demeanor and dress
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.120]   be shaped by the glad gratefulness
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.140]   and serious reverence that come
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.180]   from the firmness of the kingdom
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.820]   and the fire of God's holiness.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.340]   Hebrews 12, 28, "Let us be grateful
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.380]   "for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken,
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.600]   "and let us offer to God acceptable worship
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.820]   "with reverence and awe,
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.820]   "for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.360]   Acceptable worship will have a strong taste
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.040]   of reverence and awe.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.440]   This is missing in many churches,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.760]   and it affects not only the kind of clothing we wear,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.960]   but the kind of souls we become.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.240]   Number four, let our demeanor and dress
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.260]   reflect the biblical call to self-humbling
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.300]   rather than self-exaltation.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.580]   Luke 18, 14, "Everyone who exalts himself
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.140]   "will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.580]   "will be exalted."
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.620]   Now that's, of course, to be true of all Christians
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.660]   all the time, everywhere, but I'm arguing
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.540]   especially in corporate worship.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.540]   Let every man and every woman think
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.380]   as he or she dresses Sunday morning.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.920]   Something like this.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.400]   I want to be totally non-distracting
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.480]   in my presence in worship today.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.680]   I will not, I will not, as a man or a woman,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.560]   try to stand out, not by style, not by expense,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.320]   not by cleverness, not by offensiveness,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.080]   not by sexiness, by what I reveal
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.240]   or how tight my clothing is,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.760]   or how elegant or trendy my hair is,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.840]   or how perfectly coordinated my colors are,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   or how free from taboos I am, or how solemn I am.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.160]   My aim will be to dress and act in a way
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   that simply does not attract or distract
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.720]   from what should be happening here.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.920]   That's my interpretation of humble yourself.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   Get out of the way, dress to be undistracting.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.360]   Number five, let our demeanor and dress
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   reflect the joyful readiness to embrace all comers
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.240]   who may not be able to dress the way we would like to
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.680]   or like them to.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.720]   James chapter two hits this pretty head on.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.480]   My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.880]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.820]   For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.520]   comes into your assembly and a poor man
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.320]   with shabby clothing also comes in
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.240]   and you pay attention to the one who wears fine clothing
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.760]   and say, you sit here in a good place
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.520]   while you say to the poor man, you stand over there
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.720]   or sit at my feet, have you not made distinctions
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.760]   among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   Now, the alternative to this judging partiality
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.120]   is not something as superficial
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.420]   as everybody dressing in shabby clothes.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.960]   That's ridiculous.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.160]   This is a matter of the heart.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.440]   It may be that the richest woman in the church
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.820]   dressed in very nice clothing,
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.820]   the richest woman in the church will be the quickest
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.300]   to embrace the poor person in shabby clothes
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.560]   who walks in on Sunday morning.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.040]   Her heart may be totally right
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.820]   while the cool dressed down click
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.480]   don't pay any attention at all.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.780]   It's not a matter of the clothing at that point.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.860]   It's a matter of the heart.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.320]   And finally, number six, let our demeanor and dress
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.120]   reflect the biblical truth that many things in life,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.080]   including worship life, are decided not by what is commanded
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.900]   or forbidden biblically,
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.960]   but what is fitting and proper biblically.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.120]   When the father in the parable of the prodigal son
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.680]   tried to entreat his elder son to join the feast,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.640]   he didn't say, get in here, it's my command
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.040]   for goodness sakes, I'm your dad.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   He said, son, this is verse 32 of Luke 15,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.280]   "It is fitting to celebrate and be glad
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.600]   for this your brother was dead and is alive.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.800]   He was lost and is found."
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   If the only criterion you are using right now
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.460]   in deciding how you act and dress in corporate worship
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.200]   is, well, I believe God is gracious
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.560]   and accept us just as we are.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.880]   You have a hold of something wonderful, you do,
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   and it's lopsided and needs supplementing with more truth.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.640]   Let me illustrate, and I'll close with this illustration.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.240]   If you're married to the most wonderful woman,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.480]   the most patient, most kind, most forgiving,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.600]   most gracious woman in the world,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   who loves you as you are, accepts you as you are,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.720]   and you show up on your 25th wedding anniversary celebration
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.440]   at a nice restaurant where she has gone ahead of you
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.960]   'cause you've been at work,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.840]   and she has made some nice plans for you,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.080]   and you show up at this restaurant in T-shirt
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.380]   and tennis shorts 'cause you just come straight
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.240]   from the tennis court, she will accept you,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.600]   she will love you, that's the kind of woman she is,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.040]   and you will have not done well
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.200]   because that was unfitting.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   So I end where I began.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   All these things and many more are shaped and guided
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.540]   by your vision, our vision, of what God is like,
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.480]   and what you believe should be happening in this service.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.840]   What is fitting before this God?
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.320]   - Amen, yeah, it's a question of fittingness.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.800]   Thank you, John, for the question.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.920]   Thank you, Pastor John, for the response,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   and thank you for listening.

[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.240]   Well, is the Calvinist-Arminian debate overblown?
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.640]   Does it really matter?
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   Will it make any difference in our lives anyways?
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.360]   That is the question, up next time on Monday.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.200]   I'm Tony Reinhke, we'll see you then.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
