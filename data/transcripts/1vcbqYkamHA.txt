[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   Our first question comes from Lena, who says, "What would you recommend to those
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.260]   who don't have a mentor? You mentioned a couple of times the necessity to have a
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.120]   mentor, especially in an academic career, but I'm very unfortunate in this regard.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.680]   My PhD supervisor is far from being a star in his field and has very poor
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.440]   supervising skills." Well, Lena, usually what I advise is that if you don't have
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.120]   a good mentor, get a good peer group. I mean, actually, this is quite common. This
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.240]   was, for example, relatively standard in the theory group at MIT where I was
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.400]   doing my doctoral training. It was very peer group focused, so you would
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.080]   assemble a collection of collaborators of fellow graduate students and postdocs,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.580]   and you would work with them to come up with ideas and create new research
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.880]   directions. Now, I think this was common, in particular in the theory group, because
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.920]   A, the type of work we did was such that you didn't need, for example, a really
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.160]   well-funded physical laboratory. You weren't tied to a grant in the way you
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   might be if you worked in a biology lab where it says, "Look, we hired you to do
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.200]   these assays, and we need you to do these assays." It was a lot more flexible when
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.720]   you're doing mathematics, but also these professors in that department were very
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.040]   famous, and they had famous people things to do. These were really big-name
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.800]   scholars. There was multiple Turing Award winners. There was multiple Genius Grant
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.680]   Award winners. They often had large research groups, and so there was just a
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.560]   real culture of come up with an almost entrepreneurial startup-like collection
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   of peers to work with. And in fact, a lot of my work was done that way. I did a lot
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.240]   of good work with my advisor as well, but I did a lot of work with these peers,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.680]   many of whom I still collaborate with today. So Lena, this is a known model, and
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.440]   it's what I'm going to suggest to you. Find other researchers who are doctoral
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.680]   students or postdocs that you like, that are interesting, that are working on
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.120]   interesting things, and start working on interesting things with them. I think you
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.360]   can learn quite a lot that way. I know you mentioned your question that I
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.960]   advise always getting a mentor in academia. That's not actually something I
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.560]   advise. I think it's fine, but I don't think it's a necessary condition for
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.760]   success. So look for the people around you you can control. Make them as good as
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.800]   possible.
