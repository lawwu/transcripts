[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   "Are you an asshole or not?"
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.120]   It's in the eye of the beholder.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.200]   If you're bad in your mind, that's the biggest problem.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.280]   If you're not allowed, it goes against your,
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   I call this your personal bill of rights.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.440]   You might not have a right to say,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.200]   "No, I'm not available for that."
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.120]   You might not have a right to not respond to all the emails.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   And as long as you don't have that right,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.080]   'cause you haven't claimed it,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.000]   you're gonna feel guilty, you're gonna feel stressed.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.040]   So in my personal bill of rights,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.640]   I have a right to not respond to all emails.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.080]   I'll reply to a lot of some of the emails of my clients.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.160]   I'll try to get back to a lot of them,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.560]   but not everybody, not all the time.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280]   So someone out there sometimes might think
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.840]   that is E's guy, he's an asshole
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.800]   'cause he didn't do X for me.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.320]   And you know what?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.200]   That's okay.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000]   So really finding that permission to not do the things
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.560]   that you truly don't wanna do.
