[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.880]   found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians in the first chapter and the
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.200]   thirteenth verse. The thirteenth verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.320]   the Colossians, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.640]   translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son." Now that obviously refers to
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.840]   something that has gone before and what has gone before of course is verse 12 in
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.080]   which we read this, "Giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.960]   partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light." Then come these words
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.120]   that we are looking at tonight, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.080]   and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son." In other words we return
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.680]   to a consideration and an examination of this wonderful statement of the gospel
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.840]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that is given us in this paragraph, in this
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.040]   section of this first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Colossians running from
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   this twelfth verse to the twenty-second verse. Now we begin our consideration of
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.520]   this last Sunday night because as I then indicated in the twelfth verse the
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.160]   Apostle gives us a kind of summary or epitome of the whole of the gospel. He
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.320]   tells us what are its main characteristics and here they are. He said
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.480]   that the characteristic of a Christian is that he gives thanks unto the Father
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.960]   and then he proceeds to tell us why he gives thanks to the Father. A Christian, he
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   says, by definition is a man who's filled with praise and of thanksgiving unto God.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.480]   Why? Well, one reason was because it is God who alone gives us the gift of
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   salvation. Salvation is entirely of God. Giving thanks unto the Father who hath
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.800]   made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.680]   Everything in Christianity is the free gift of God's grace. There would never
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.480]   have been any Christianity were it not for God. It is all of God. That's why we
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.320]   thank him. But then the second reason we saw for thanking him was this. Because of
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.000]   what he's done to us in order to enable us and to make us fit to receive this
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   salvation, who hath made us meet, hath made us qualified to be partakers of the
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.200]   inheritance of the saints in life. If he didn't do that, none of us would ever
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.520]   partake of this great salvation. And thirdly, we saw that we must thank God
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   because of the glorious character of the salvation itself. Inheritors with the
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   saints in life. The glorious kingdom of God. That is what salvation does. It
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   prepares us and makes us fit and meet. It qualifies us to be partakers and
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.760]   participants in this inheritance of the saints in life, which is the kingdom of
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   God. Now then, immediately we say that a question arises. Why then doesn't
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.920]   everybody thank God? Paul is writing to these Colossian Christians and he says,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.080]   "I thank God for you, because I know that you are giving thanks to God." He says, "You
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.560]   are strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, and to
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.400]   all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness, giving thanks unto the
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.000]   Father." He says, "I know that's true. And all Christians, as I say, give thanks to
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.280]   God the Father for those reasons." Well, very well, here's the question. Why doesn't
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.160]   the whole world do this? Why isn't everybody in the world tonight thanking
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.080]   God? Why is it that anybody should not thank God? Or let me put the question in
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.840]   a different way. Why is there all this confusion about the nature of the
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.120]   Christian gospel? As I've said, at the moment you know what it is, well you
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.680]   thank God for it. It's inevitable. Everybody in the Bible
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.400]   thanks God for it. "Praise be unto God, thanks be unto God," they say. The moment
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.020]   you see what it is, you thank God for it. So I'm arguing that if people don't thank
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.880]   God, it is very likely to be due to the fact that they've misunderstood what
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   Christianity is. And I'm trying to show on these Sunday evenings what a terrible
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.000]   confusion there is with regard to that subject also. That people don't know what
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.400]   Christianity really is and what it offers. Or let me put it in a third form.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.480]   Why is it people don't thank God? Or why is it that they don't see what God has
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.120]   done in and through his dear Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ? We are
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.760]   approaching the season of Advent, Christmas. God sending his own Son into
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.800]   this world. Why isn't the whole world thanking God for it? There's only one
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.600]   answer. They don't see why he needed to come. They don't see why he had to come.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.920]   They don't see what he did after he had come. Still, you see, it's the same answer.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.360]   Or let me put it finally in this form. Why is it that the whole world tonight
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   is not living in this realm of light and of righteousness and of truth, inheritors
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.600]   with the saints in light? Not in darkness, but in light. The realm of truth, the
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.040]   realm of honesty, the realm of justice, the realm of righteousness. Why is the
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.320]   world as it is tonight, troubled and confused, doing hidden and dark things,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.540]   resorting to subterfuges? Why isn't everything open and plain and in the
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:35.720]   light of God? Why not? Now these are the questions, I say, that inevitably arise.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   And there's only one answer to the question. Men and women are not thanking
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.840]   God tonight for his great salvation, which we've considered in verse 12,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.760]   because obviously they don't realize, they haven't realized what is necessary
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:00.840]   before we can be made fit and qualified to enter into that inheritance, to enter
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.160]   into this kingdom of God and of light, and to live the right life of
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.680]   righteousness and of holiness. That's the first answer that is suggested to us by
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.000]   our text this evening. Mankind doesn't thank God and praise the Father. Why?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.960]   Well, because they don't realize what he's done and what he's made possible.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.240]   That's because they don't realize what he had to do and why he had to do it. In
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.440]   other words, it all comes, I say, to this failure to realize what God has to do to
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.200]   us. He has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.640]   light. What does he have to do to us before we are meet and fit to be
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.720]   partakers of that inheritance? Now there, I say, is the whole cause of the trouble.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.800]   Or, to put it in one phrase, it's this. The whole trouble is due to man's ignorance
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.560]   of his real state and condition by nature. Now this, to me, is one of the most
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.920]   important things we can grasp at the present time. This not only accounts for
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:10.640]   the failure to understand the gospel and its character, this rarely accounts for
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.600]   the whole state of this world at this very moment. The main trouble with men at
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.720]   this very moment is that he is not clear about himself, his own state and
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.240]   condition. And that is why there is no hope for him until he sees that. Now this
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.980]   is the first principle of the Bible. The first thing we need to be told is the
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:39.420]   truth about ourselves as we are. And I say the whole trouble and tragedy in the
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.500]   world at this very moment is that man, in all his cleverness, doesn't know the
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:52.360]   real truth about himself, about his actual real state and condition. It is
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.720]   that which is put before us so clearly by the Bible, and in particular by this
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.120]   verse that we are examining at this moment. "Who hath translated us, delivered
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.000]   us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   dear Son." That's what happens to a Christian. A Christian is a man who has
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.560]   been delivered out of or from the power of darkness, and has been translated into
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.600]   the kingdom of God's dear Son. Now then, let's examine this. Our verse tells us
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.440]   what is wrong with men as he is by nature. It tells us what is necessary
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:38.640]   before he can be put right. Now, how badly I say is this message needed? What is
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.200]   wrong, I say, with the world tonight? What's the matter with men? What's wrong
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.680]   with men? Surely that's the first question everybody should be asking. As
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.240]   we look out upon our world tonight and see it, in its trouble, its confusion,
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.880]   messing up these horrible, terrible armaments, and all the terrible
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.400]   possibilities. Now, the first question surely we should all ask is this, not a
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.040]   political question. We must go deeper than that. Not a social question, not an
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.800]   economic question, not a military question. The question we all should be
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.360]   asking is this, what is it that is wrong with men that makes him do such folly?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   What's the matter with men? Now, these are the questions, this is the first great
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.240]   question we've got to face. There are many answers being given. There are some
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.120]   people still, sometimes I think there are quite a lot of them, who answer the
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.080]   question by saying there's nothing wrong with men. It's just a matter of bad luck.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.560]   It's just an odd phase through which we are passing. For some say it's fate. It's
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   all in our stars. The elements, as it were, are against us. There's nothing wrong with
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.320]   men. They say, "Man, he's a good fellow. He's essentially good. He's more sinned
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.600]   against than sinning." There are many who still hold that view. That man himself is
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.120]   rarely all right, but somehow or another there is a sort of malign fate. And
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.280]   that's their only way of explaining it. But we shall see in a moment how
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:18.800]   inadequate it is. Another common and very popular view is the so-called evolutionary
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.240]   view. And according to this evolutionary view, what is happening at the present
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.420]   time is just a sort of time lag in this process. We are advancing, they say, but we
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.840]   haven't arrived yet. Don't be impatient. We haven't arrived at perfection yet. We
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.080]   are making tremendous strides, they say. History proves that. Look back at
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.440]   primitive men. Look at him living in his caves and scribbling on the walls. Look
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.520]   at him and how he's advanced and developed, and look at modern men. That's
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.600]   the argument, you see, that man's advancing. Of course, it's rather
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.760]   inconvenient for that argument that at the present time man is in such terrible
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.800]   trouble. Seems to be in worse trouble than he was a hundred years ago, and is
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.400]   still scribbling on the walls, and doing things which are even more ridiculous.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.240]   But there it is. Some would explain it purely in terms of the time lag in the
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:18.280]   evolutionary process. Then another theory, and this again is quite a common one, and
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.520]   has been very common especially for the last 30 years, that all the trouble in
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:31.160]   the world really is due to just a handful of bad people. That the world's
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.320]   all right, that man is all right, and that everything was going all right until
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.800]   these people began to arise. Mussolini, Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, and so on. These
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   individuals, just a handful of evil men spoiling the whole world. We're all
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.280]   right, there's nothing wrong with us, this is the argument. The ordinary man is a
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.320]   decent, he's a good fellow. It's just these monsters that arise that cause all our
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.120]   troubles, and all our troubles tonight are just due to a handful of people. If
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.920]   only these people behaved themselves, the whole world would be perfect. Isn't that a
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.240]   common view? Are there not many present tonight who probably subscribe to that
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.920]   view? Now let's look at that for just a second, because it's such a fallacious
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.960]   view. Strangely enough, while preparing this very message, I came across the most
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:24.560]   interesting review of a book that has recently been published on Goering. One of
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.480]   these bad, evil men, to whom everything is being attributed. Two men have written a
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.800]   book, Manville and Frankel, have written a book on Goering. And having written their
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.400]   book, they try to analyze him, and they think that at last they found the
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   explanation. They couldn't understand the man and his behavior, but they said at
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.720]   last they found it. They discovered that he was a morphine addict, and that seems
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.080]   to them to be a satisfactory explanation. But not to the reviewer. Listen to the
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:58.280]   reviewer. He says, "Surely this is wrong," he says, "and it is not puzzling at all as to
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:04.320]   why this man was the monster that he was, unless one seeks refuge in the idea that
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:13.200]   only monsters are capable of monstrous behavior. The truth we are reluctant to
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.880]   face is that there is no depravity and no cruelty that is beyond the ingenuity
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.200]   of quite ordinary people, who are otherwise amiable and even conventional."
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:34.600]   And how right and how true he is. "These men are not monsters. We're all capable of
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.160]   that," he says. "You can't explain the world," he says, "in terms of these men and their
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.560]   conduct and their behavior. The astounding thing," he says, "is this. These men in a
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.720]   sense are just ordinary men. Any one of us has got it in him to be what these men
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.640]   actually were." Strangely enough, another book has been published at the same time,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:15:01.440]   giving a pictorial review and history of the Nazi regime in Germany. And the
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.160]   reviewer makes the same comment about this. A whole series of pictures of
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.480]   different men are given there. And he says, "The amazing thing is, as you look at
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.840]   this gallery of pictures, you really are looking at quite ordinary people. In the
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.520]   book there is a photograph of Hitler as a babe. Who would ever have prophesied he
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.200]   would have become the man that he became? He looks like any other babe. And so with
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   all the rest of them, you can't explain the state of the world in terms of a few
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.520]   monsters. No, no. When you're honest and admit it, you'll find that we've all got
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.840]   it in us. The truth we are reluctant to face is that there is no depravity and
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.440]   no cruelty that is beyond the ingenuity of quite ordinary people, who are
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.560]   otherwise amiable and even conventional. These men happen to have the power, and
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.800]   they exercised it. There are people who are not given the power, but who as far
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.040]   as they've got the power, are exercising it in their families, in their homes, in
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.960]   their trade union, in their political parties, and in the circles in which they
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   turn at this very moment. Undoubtedly the reviewer is right. That's not the
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:11.480]   explanation. Well then let me mention just one other. And this is the view of
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.800]   course of your psychologist. The psychologists are supposed to understand
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:22.920]   and to explain everything. Freud, Jung, and so on. Well, let me say this for them. They
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.680]   at any rate have realized that there is a problem. They've done very good work
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.200]   along that line. They've shattered the foolish optimism of the late Victorians
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.800]   and the Edwardians. Listen to Jung. This is how he puts it. "We need more
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.320]   understanding of human nature, because the only real danger that exists is man
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:51.280]   himself. He is the great danger, and we are pitifully unaware of it. We know
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:58.680]   nothing of men, far too little. His psyche should be studied, because we are the
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:06.360]   origin of all coming evil." Now there's Jung. Here's a man who doesn't believe in God, you
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.880]   see. Here's one of the leaders of this atheistical movement that would explain
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.280]   everything in terms of the psyche, the working of men's own soul, as it were. But
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:23.320]   there he says, he admits it. "We know nothing of men, far too little." Now my
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.400]   friends, if there's anybody here who's not a Christian and you think you know
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.680]   all about it, there's one of your own authorities. He says, "We know nothing
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.360]   about men, far too little." And yet he says, "We must." Why? Well, he says, "Because men
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.240]   is such a terrible danger, he is the great danger, and we are pitifully
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.360]   unaware of it. His psyche should be studied, because we are the origin of all
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:51.440]   coming evil." And I'm putting one further bit of evidence before you. I apologize
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.760]   for doing this in a way, but my dear friends, there are men and women, you see,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.680]   who say there's nothing in Christianity, it's got nothing to give. I'm trying to
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.640]   show you that it's the only thing that has something to give, and that all these
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.800]   other theories that have caused men and women to turn away from God and from
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.840]   Christ are absolutely and completely bankrupt. There's Jung admitting it. But
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.560]   listen to this. Here is a review in the current number of the British Medical
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:27.260]   Journal. "The psychosis of mankind." A man has written a book, the late Dr. Charles
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:36.560]   Berg, and you know what title he put to it? "Madkind." Not "mankind," but "madkind."
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.200]   M-A-D-K-I-N-D. He's coined a new word. Here's the title of his book, "Madkind,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:50.080]   the Origin and Development of the Mind." What is he saying? Well, listen, here's the
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:57.800]   reviewer. Here's the title, the neologism, "Madkind" expresses the notion that we, that
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:06.160]   is, mankind, are all a little mad, victims of a protracted and still uncured
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.680]   psychosis. It cannot be otherwise, as superstitious taboo colors our social
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.960]   life and our personal conduct to such a degree that human thought is founded
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:25.000]   upon delusions. Here's a serious writer. What about the cure? What are we going to
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.080]   do about it? Well, he says, "Practical treatment to alleviate the deplorable
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.760]   human lot should be commenced in babyhood and continued throughout
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.700]   childhood. Yet psychoanalysis of infants and children is not advised." What does he
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.260]   advise them? Here it is, "Those responsible for the very young should have
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.740]   psychoanalytical treatment. Without it, they will assuredly contaminate the
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:57.780]   growing mind with their own disease." Very well. Need I say any more? There, you see,
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:03.460]   is mankind without Christ and without the gospel. Here are able, educated men
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.620]   who say their great brains prohibit their believing in God and in Christ and
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.860]   in the Christian salvation. They understand the problem, and there's their
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:21.060]   answer, "Madkind." And the only hope is that all of you who are parents begin on your
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.700]   psychoanalytical treatment as soon as you can, before you corrupt your children
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.060]   any further. And it's a hopeless business, obviously. Indeed, all these men, you see,
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.100]   are in despair. They don't know. They don't understand. At long last, they're
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.880]   having to admit that they don't know the nature of men. "We know nothing of men," says
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.780]   Jung. "Far too little." Of course they don't. That's their old trouble, and that's the
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.500]   trouble with the world this evening. It's all utterly hopeless. It leaves us with
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.200]   nothing but despair. Now, then, the only true view of men and his world tonight
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.460]   is the view that is found here. And here it is in this 13th verse of the first
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.180]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Colossians. What is it? One, proposition one.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:12.620]   "Men by nature is in the power and grip of the power of darkness, who has
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:18.180]   delivered us from the power of darkness," which means that we need to be delivered.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.900]   A Christian is a man who has been delivered. All who are not Christian have
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.660]   not been delivered. "Men by nature is in the power and the grip of the power of
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:33.060]   darkness." Now, then, what's he mean? Well, this is not something in the psyche. This
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:39.220]   isn't faith. This isn't anything that can be explained along those lines. Man is not
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:46.100]   free. Why is man as he is, and why does he behave as he is? Why is his world as it
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.820]   is tonight? There's only one answer. It is under the power of darkness. If you
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.500]   prefer it, it's under the power of the devil. It is under the power of the God
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.380]   of this world. It is under the power of the prince of the power of the air, the
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.980]   spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. It is in the grip and
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.700]   the power of principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:15.540]   spiritual wickedness in high or in heavenly places. Those are all scriptural
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:22.140]   quotations, saying what is said in our text tonight in a different way. What's
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.580]   it mean? If mankind, if the whole world, is under the domination and in the power
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.500]   of the grip of this power of darkness, how did it ever get there? What does it
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.940]   mean? Well, now, I've already read you the answer to the question by reading the
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:43.740]   third chapter of the book of Genesis at the beginning. There is the whole
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:51.260]   explanation, and it is the only adequate explanation. It's not merely your
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:57.300]   Hitlers, your Goerings, it's all of us, every one of us. It's not something that
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:05.460]   can be psychoanalyzed out of us, it's too deep. It isn't merely us. It is this power
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.820]   that dominates over us, governs us and controls us. What is it? Well, there's your
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:19.260]   explanation, as far as we are given it by the Bible itself. God makes his perfect
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.300]   creation, creates men and puts him in it, makes a help meet for men, the woman, and
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.700]   there they are in paradise and living a perfect life of communion with God and
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:36.300]   enjoyment. The devil comes in, who is more subtle than anybody else, and he tempts,
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.860]   and he puts this doubt into the mind, he says, as God said. Are you fool enough to
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.860]   listen to God? God knows perfectly well that the moment you eat that particular
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.020]   fruit you'll become as God, you'll be enlightened, you'll understand as much as
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.380]   he does, so he's keeping you down. He tempted them, and they listened to him,
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.620]   and they fell. And, of course, the result of that was they put themselves under
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.780]   his power. Well, who is this devil, you say? The answer of the Bible is that he is a
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:10.060]   fallen angel. God created the angels before he created the world and men. These
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.060]   are angelic spiritual beings. God made them and again made them perfect, but we
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.460]   are told that one of them raised himself up in rebellion against God, jealous of
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.260]   God, not content with being blessed by God and serving God. He wanted to be a
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:29.180]   God. He is the first rebel. He lifted himself against God, and he thereby fell,
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.820]   and he was punished and cast down, and all who followed him. Now then, he has
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:42.460]   hated God ever since. He is God's great antagonist. The devil hates God with all
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.340]   the intensity of his nature, so that when God created the world and created men,
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.380]   the devil immediately said, "Here's my opportunity. I'm going to smash up his
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.980]   creation. I'm going to ruin it. What better way was there, as it were, of
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.060]   dragging God down than to ruin his handiwork and spoil his creation?" So he
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.340]   entered into the paradise of God, and he persuaded men to listen. Men rebelled. He
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:11.660]   fell, and thereby he puts himself under the power of the authority of the devil.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.460]   Now, God said that to them there and then. He said, "There shall be enmity between
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.660]   thy seed and the seed of the woman," and it's gone on ever since. Ever since that
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.900]   moment, the story of mankind has been trouble and confusion and pain and
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.100]   darkness and war and all that you and I know tonight. It's been ever since then.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:34.520]   It began then. It's gone on ever since. There's our radical explanation. Power of
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:40.220]   darkness. Now, I want you to see that this is something not only that is taught in
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.060]   the Old Testament and in the book of Genesis, it's taught everywhere. Listen to
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.220]   the Lord Jesus Christ himself teaching this. You find it in the 11th chapter of
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:55.260]   Luke's Gospel. This is how our Lord puts it, "When a strong man armed keepeth his
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.700]   palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him and
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:06.140]   overcome him, he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted and divided his
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.340]   spoils." That's it. That's the position of mankind, says the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:19.060]   All mankind, he says, is like the creatures of a strong man armed. A great
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.420]   chieftain, a great king, a great emperor, a great nobleman, and he's got a great
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.180]   palace with walls around it. And there he keeps his citizens within it. A strong man
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:36.980]   armed keepeth his goods in peace. Same thing, power of darkness. The apostle Paul,
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.620]   this same apostle, in writing to the Corinthians in the fourth chapter and the
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.940]   fourth gospel, asks a question, "Why don't people believe the gospel?" His answer is,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:50.220]   "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:56.060]   world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not. Lest the light of the
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.860]   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:06.460]   2 Corinthians 3, 2 Corinthians 4, 3 and 4. Same thing. Indeed, it is everywhere.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.420]   "Yea, where he quickens," says the apostle Paul, "to the Ephesians, who were dead in
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.700]   trespasses and sins, wherein in time past he walked according to the course of
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.540]   this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:28.020]   worketh in the children of disobedience." Same thing. The apostle John has exactly
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.060]   the same teaching. He's comforting these early Christians who are having a very
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:38.340]   difficult and a very hard time, and this is how he puts it. "Ye are of God, little
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.420]   children, and have overcome them." These are the Antichrists that are fighting
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.380]   against them. "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them." Why?
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.480]   Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. There is a
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.940]   "he" in the world and dominating its life. In the next chapter, the fifth chapter of
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.780]   this first epistle, he puts it still more plainly. Listen. "We know that we are of
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:09.060]   God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness," or "lieth in the wicked one."
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:14.500]   In other words, he says the whole world is in the embrace of the devil. The whole
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:20.860]   world is lying in the bosom of this wicked, evil one. The whole world. There it
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:27.700]   is. He is the God of this world. Now then, here is a very serious matter. This is
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.140]   why the world is as it is. Notice what we are told. We need to be delivered from
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:40.100]   the power of darkness. It's a power. Very interesting to notice the difference here.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:46.340]   He says, "who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.820]   into the kingdom of his dear Son." He doesn't say that there is a kingdom of
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.700]   darkness, it's the power of darkness. Why? What's the difference? Oh, the difference
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:02.620]   is this. It's not a kingdom. The devil is a usurper. He has no right at all. He's a
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:07.500]   rebel. He's one who's taken authority unto himself. He never was given this
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.460]   authority. He was never meant to rule over men and to tyrannize over him. Man
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.220]   was meant to be governed by God. The devil has taken it upon himself. He's a
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:22.380]   usurper. He's a rebel. He hasn't a kingdom. He's a power only. A stolen power. What
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.340]   else? I'm simply expounding the word to you. All that is contained in this word
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:38.740]   "power." It not only is not a kingdom, but it's not orderly either. It is unruly. It
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:44.620]   is a confused power and a troubled power. That's what makes Isaiah say that the
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:49.180]   wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.380]   and dirt. That's it. That's a perfect picture of the power of darkness, the
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.140]   power of the devil, like the sea in constant movement and motion, cannot rest.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.420]   It's a disorderly kingdom. It's a kingdom of confusion. It's a kingdom of trouble.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:09.980]   How unlike God's kingdom. God, we are told, is not the author of confusion but
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:15.780]   of peace. And how do we read about the creation of the world in Genesis 1? The
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.340]   Spirit brewed out over the abyss, over the confusion, over the chaos. And God said,
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.780]   "Let there be light," and there was light. And then God begins to produce order. He
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.500]   begins to create first day, second day, third day, and so on. And he brings order.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.700]   He brings paradise. He brings perfection. He looked at it all and saw it was good.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:37.820]   Out of the chaos, order and perfection. But not so with the power of darkness.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:44.500]   Disorder. Confusion. Not only that. It's a capricious power. I'm simply still
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.900]   drawing out the meaning of the word power. You can check me. Read Bishop
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.620]   Lightfoot on this. He'll tell you all this. Capricious power. Contradictory power.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.020]   That's always characteristic, isn't it, of somebody who's a usurper. You see, he's
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.020]   got no law. He's got no system. All he's interested in is the exercise of power.
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.780]   And all tyrants are capricious. You never know what they'll think next. You never
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.140]   know what they'll do next. They're changing constantly. They've got no rule.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.540]   They've got no understanding. They've got no light. They have no system. All they're
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.140]   interested in is their whim, their desire. There'll be this one day, that the next
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:22.980]   day. This is so typical of the power of darkness. Sometimes, as the Apostle Paul
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.340]   to the Corinthians in the second epistle, the devil turns himself into an angel of
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.700]   light. He'll turn himself into anything to get his own way. The devil can quote
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:37.820]   scripture. Misquote it. He can interpret scripture. Misinterpret it. He comes as a
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.980]   would-be friend. Then he hits you the next moment. Isn't that the treatment
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.860]   that sin gives you? It seems so wonderful when it first comes and entices you. The
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.420]   next moment you're crying and weeping and breaking your heart and in pain and
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.140]   sorrow. It's the same one who does it all. The capriciousness, the
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.580]   contradictoriness of this usurped power, this tyranny of the devil. That's the
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:04.420]   next thing. The tyranny involved in the slavery. That is why the Bible so often
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:09.660]   compares the slavery of the children of Israel in the captivity of Egypt to sin
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.500]   and what sin does to us. It's such a perfect illustration. There were those
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.940]   children of Israel making bricks, you see. Then the tyrant says, "Give them less
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:23.180]   straw and make them produce more bricks." That's it. Slash them if they don't and
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.660]   keep them there. A tyranny and a slavery. This is all true of sin. The power of
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:37.940]   darkness. Oh, how powerful it is. Our Lord used that image of the strong man armed
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.260]   very deliberately. He wanted to bring out this impression of force and of power.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.420]   And it's such a terrible power that every man that's ever lived is but as
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:52.280]   putty in his hands. We are all weak and we are all helpless. The fact of the
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.300]   matter is that we, all of us by nature, are nothing but slaves and slaves of
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:03.740]   this power of darkness. "Which is so powerful, God be thanked," says Paul to
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:13.500]   the Romans, "that you who were the slaves of sin." And aren't we all the slaves of
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.700]   sin? Isn't the world being governed and ruled tonight in every respect as Paul
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:25.140]   tells those Ephesians? By the course of this world, by the thing to do, by what
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.020]   everybody's doing, by what we read in the newspaper and see on the television and
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:34.300]   hear on the radio, everybody's, the course of this world, mankind is in unutterable
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   slavery. Oh, the power of this darkness. Why do we keep on doing things that we
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.540]   know are wrong? Why do we do things that we know that hurt us? Why do we know
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:51.020]   things though we know something of their consequences? Why do we do them? What is it?
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:56.220]   Evil that I would, not that I do. Why? And the good that I would, I do not. Why? Oh,
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.660]   it's this power that's gripping us and holding us and manipulates us. It's a
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:07.780]   terrible power. Yes, but notice it's the power of darkness. And that is how the
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.380]   Bible always describes this element, this evil. It always refers to it as darkness.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.060]   Why? Well, it's the opposite of God. God said, "Let there be light." The devil says, "Let me
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:23.140]   bring darkness into this kingdom of light." God says, "Oh," the devil says, "I'll bring in
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:29.420]   confusion." Oh, the power of the God of this world, this power of darkness. It's a
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:36.060]   dark power. What do you mean, sir? Someone will let me show you what I mean. It
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:44.220]   darkens the mind. In other words, it keeps us in the dark. It creates mists. It
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:49.420]   creates confusion. It creates muddle. It produces fogs, intellectual and other
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.820]   fogs. I've already given you some examples of them this evening. That's the
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.900]   sort of fog and mist that it creates in the realm of the mind, but more seriously.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.460]   Why is the world as it is tonight? Well, it's because it's ignorant of God. It's in
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.900]   the dark about God. And it's the devil that keeps it in the dark about God. He
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.580]   still comes and says, "Do you still believe in God?" That's what he said to Eve, you see,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.340]   at the beginning. He said, "Don't be such fools. Don't listen. He's only keeping you
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.540]   down. Get rid of that. Religion's against you. It's the thing that keeps you down.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:25.140]   Set yourself free. Be a man. Assert yourself." And on the other end, it's got to
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.460]   admit he doesn't understand men, and that men is the greatest danger himself,
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.420]   and that we're all monsters. You see, it's a mess and a jumble of contradictions.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.500]   Man is perfect at one moment, doesn't need God. Then the next moment, well, we
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.860]   don't know what he is. And there you have these terrible descriptions of him, that
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.260]   he's psychotic, that he's ill, he's diseased, he can't think. His mind is all
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.300]   twisted and perverted and gone astray. It's utter confusion. Yes, but the real
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:55.620]   confusion is the ignorance with regard to God. It's because he doesn't know and
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.900]   recognize God, the world is as it is tonight. And it is because men doesn't
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:06.100]   know God, he doesn't know himself. Thinks he's wonderful, finds he's a fool, doesn't
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.460]   know the truth about himself. Jung has admitted it. Oh, but still more important,
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:17.060]   he is ignorant that he's just a pilgrim and a stranger here. He is ignorant about
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:22.220]   death. I know his dabbling with spiritism and various other things, the occult, and
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.020]   all these extra sensory phenomena and all the rest of it. You see, he knows
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.580]   within himself there is something else. And he's trying to find out something
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.820]   about it, but he doesn't know. What he doesn't know is this, that it is
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:39.700]   appointed unto all men once to die, and after death the judgment. We are very
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.260]   interested in death, but we rarely speak about judgment. There's a great deal
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.420]   about death in the newspapers, and these authorities, philosophers, and psychologists
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.100]   are doing their best to save us, they say, from death. All right, why don't they tell
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.900]   us something about the judgment? Have you ever heard one of them writing a letter
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.420]   about judgment? Of course you haven't. They're ignorant, they're in the dark
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.940]   about it. They're in the kingdom under the power of darkness, they're blinded.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.940]   They don't know that when they and every one of us dies, we stand before Almighty
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:15.860]   God in the judgment. They don't know, likewise, that our eternal destiny is
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:23.140]   determined by what we do in this life and in this world. They don't know that
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:28.460]   all who've lived a godless, selfish, foolish life will go to everlasting
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.180]   misery and perdition. They don't know that. If they did, they'd begin to pay
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.620]   attention. The devil keeps them in the dark, they say, "Fancy believing that." "Do you
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.100]   believe that?" he says, "You can't be such a fool." The very thing he said to Eve, he's
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.180]   still saying it, and men and women are still listening. He keeps us in the dark
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.020]   about the real truth concerning God. He says, "You will never be turned out of
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.380]   this garden. Don't believe that, it's not true." But out they went, and they can't
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.100]   get back. The flaming sword and the cherubim are there, prohibiting a return,
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.980]   and mankind still doesn't know that, and thinks that by civilization or
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:02.700]   psychoanalysis it can cure itself. Oh, the monstrous darkness of it all. But finally
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:09.660]   he keeps them ignorant of the gospel. "Though God's Son has come into this world to
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:15.900]   save us and set us free, the devil keeps us in the dark. If our gospel be hid, it
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.220]   is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.180]   of them that believe, not lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ."
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.100]   My dear friend, have you realized this? If you are not a Christian, there's only one
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:33.020]   reason for it. The devil won't let you believe. He's blinding you, confusing you,
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:37.500]   with his supposed cleverness, which is nothing but hollowness the moment you
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.180]   really analyze it, as I've shown you. That's why men are not Christians. Not
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.500]   because they've got great minds, but because the God of this world hath
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.740]   blinded the minds of them that believe not. And of course he acts not only on
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:53.420]   the mind, but on the affections. He keeps us in the dark, I say, mentally. He does
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.460]   it equally in the realm of affections. What do we like? Lusts, passions, desires,
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.860]   evil, things that we shouldn't have, the illicit, the prohibited. These are the
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:08.460]   things we like, and we go after them. That's the darkness. What does it lead to?
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:14.660]   Well, I needn't keep you, we all know. Disorder, confusion in morals, in politics,
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:21.820]   in everything. Greed and desire in control, ambition, envy, resulting in
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:29.640]   unhappiness, fear, distrust, suffering, innocent suffering, mankind never
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.840]   satisfied, looking for something it never finds, fear of death, fear of the future,
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:41.240]   fear of anything. There never has been a generation that is so fearful, living on
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.600]   its tranquilizers and its drugs and its soporifics. Why? Oh, the fear resulting
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.400]   from the confusion in the dark. We are in the dark and groping, wondering what's
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:57.200]   happened, flash of lightning, possible bomb, war. Where are we? We don't know. You see,
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:05.800]   it is the power of darkness, and it is dark in every respect. Dark in the mind,
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:13.260]   dark in the heart, dark in the will, dark in its consequences, dark in everything.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:18.380]   And the world is miserable and unhappy and desperate and doesn't know what
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.960]   to do nor where to turn. There it is, that's the explanation. But let me hurry.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.680]   My second proposition is that God in Christ alone can deliver us from such a
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:36.120]   position, and he does deliver all who believe. Listen, this is the only way to
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:41.040]   be delivered. There's our state and condition, every one of us. Nobody can
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.720]   deny it. How can we be delivered, I ask? There's only one way. It is the way that
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:54.600]   is indicated here. Nobody else can. The patriarchs couldn't, Abraham couldn't,
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:00.440]   Noah couldn't, none of them could. The best kings that ever were given to
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:06.080]   Israel, they couldn't, the prophets couldn't, the Sarmis couldn't. All of them
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.800]   tried and all of them failed. Why? Well, because the devil was too powerful, the
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.840]   power of darkness was too great. There is none righteous, no, not one, not a single
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.160]   one has ever succeeded in conquering the devil. He beats all. Is there no hope?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   There is. We sang it in our first hymn. "Oh loving wisdom of our God, when all was
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:38.200]   sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight and to the conflict came." That's the Lord
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:44.880]   Jesus Christ. A second Adam? Another man? The first man fell and all his progeny
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.120]   have fallen ever since. We need another man, but another man isn't enough because
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.160]   if the devil conquered the first perfect man, he'll conquer any other perfect man.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:00.760]   So God sends what? His own son. God-man. Man linked to the Godhead. A second Adam
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.920]   to the fight and to the conflict came. The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:10.840]   came into this world. What for? Listen to John. "He that committeth sin is of the
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.480]   devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.080]   God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil, that he might
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.640]   undo the works of the devil." In other words, that he might conquer the devil.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:33.760]   And that is why, as you read your Gospels about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.920]   you find that the devil tried to kill him at the very beginning. He tried to
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.000]   kill him when he was but a babe. He put it into the heart of that cruel King Herod.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.280]   He tried to get rid of him. Why? Well, the devil knew that his conqueror had
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.000]   arrived. He roused the antagonism of the Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.120]   law. Why? Ah, he recognized that this was one who said, "I am the Son of God." But you
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.080]   see, he conquered him, this second Adam. Here's the only one who can conquer the
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:05.120]   power of darkness. He conquered him in his own life. Forty days and forty nights
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.600]   in the wilderness, tempted of the devil, but he routs him. He feeds him by quoting
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.000]   Scripture, and the devil has to leave him alone. He comes back, he conquers him
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.320]   again. Not only that, look at the record of his casting out devils. They bring to
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.640]   him some poor person possessed with a devil, dumb, blind, or something else, and
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   he in a moment sets them free. Think of the boy at the foot of the Mount of
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   Transfiguration. Nobody could help him. Look at the men of Gadara. They'd done
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.120]   everything. They'd bound him with fetters and chains. Still he was no better.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.480]   Violent, desperate. In a moment Christ can heal him. He can cast out devils. He's the
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:46.800]   master of the devils. He conquered the devil in his own personal life and
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:52.640]   experience. He conquered him again, I say, in this control and mastery over these
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.280]   evil powers. Here he is casting out devils, and they said he casteth out devils
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.240]   through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. But he, knowing their thoughts, said
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.680]   unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and the
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.240]   house divided against the house falleth. If Satan also be divided
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.840]   against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because ye say that I cast out
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.640]   devils through Beelzebub. And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.480]   your sons cast them out? But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.000]   doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. When a strong man armed keepeth his
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.720]   palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:40.800]   and overcome him, he taketh from him his armor wherein he trusted, and divideth
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.760]   his spoils. That's how he puts it. That's exactly what he did. So that he's able to
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.040]   say at the end of his life, The prince of this world cometh and findeth nothing in
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:59.120]   me. But wait a moment, says somebody, didn't he die upon a cross? Didn't the
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:04.640]   devil get him after all? Didn't the devil succeed in his machinations and in his
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.480]   working amongst the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.080]   Lord? Didn't he encompass his death? Don't I see him dying in weakness upon a cross?
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.680]   What's the use of talking about healing the sick and the lame and the blind and
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.240]   the deaf and even raising the dead when he can't save his own life? That's what
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.720]   the people said at the foot of the cross. "Ah," they said, "thou that savest
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.880]   fathers, come down, save thyself. You're being defeated by the enemy by your
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:34.880]   foe." Wait a minute, my friend. Just before his death, this is what our Lord said.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:43.120]   "Now is the judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:51.440]   out. And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me." That's his view of his death.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.480]   It's all right, he says, don't misunderstand it. It looks as if I'm
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.720]   going to be killed. It looks as if my life's being taken from me. Don't
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.440]   misunderstand it, he said, that isn't the explanation. Now is the judgment of this
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.880]   world. It isn't my judgment. It's the world that's being judged. And the prince of this
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.160]   world is about to be cast out. They said, "If you are going out." No, no, he says, it's
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.520]   the prince of this world, the devil, that's going to be cast out. So the
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.120]   Apostle Paul, looking back upon the cross, he puts it like this, "And having
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:26.280]   spoiled principalities and powers, he made an open show of them, triumphing over
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.120]   them in his cross, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.440]   against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:41.320]   cross. And having spoiled principalities, he's defeated them, he's robbed them of their
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.360]   armor, the strongman arm is being defeated by the cross and by his death.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:54.040]   Can I prove it? I can. The resurrection. "It is the devil that has the control of
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.240]   the power of death," says the second chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.420]   "and our Lord has risen from the dead. He has conquered death and the grave. He's
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.840]   conquered the devil, therefore, who had this power." So that the Christian, in the
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.360]   light of the resurrection, can turn with Paul and say, "Oh, death, where is thy sting?
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.800]   Oh, grave, where is thy victory? You are defeated. Thanks be unto God that giveth
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.960]   us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." The devil is already a defeated
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:32.100]   foe. The Son of God has defeated him in every respect, personally, generally, in
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:37.140]   all his manifestations and his power. And listen, he's already defeated and
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.820]   enchained, but a day is coming when he's going to be finally destroyed.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:46.020]   Revelations 20, 10, "And the devil that deceived the nations was cast into the
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.680]   lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet already are,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:57.660]   and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever." Final destruction.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:04.100]   Very well, here is the one and the only one that has ever been able to conquer
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:10.020]   the power of the darkness and its very prince. He's done it, a second Adam, to the
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:14.820]   fight and to the conflict came. Therefore, my friends, here's my message to you.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:21.300]   Believe in him, what will happen to you. You will be delivered from the power of
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:29.300]   darkness. "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, he sets us free." He's
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.380]   conquered the one who's holding us in captivity. He's the deliverer. And the
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:39.540]   word "delivers us" means with a strong arm, as a mighty conqueror. I'm not saying
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:43.940]   that the learned Greek authorities say that. It's like Israel being brought out
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:48.380]   of Egypt, though Pharaoh was strong and had his host and his chariots and his
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.540]   armaments, and the children of Israel had nothing. They were taken out with a
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:57.380]   strong arm, and Pharaoh and his hosts are destroyed in the Red Sea. That is what
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:04.340]   happens in Christ. We are brought and delivered out of the power of darkness.
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:09.260]   We are taken out of Egypt, but thank God we are not left in the wilderness. "And
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:17.100]   hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son." He doesn't leave us in the
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.140]   wilderness. He takes us out of the power of the enemy and puts us into the
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.420]   kingdom of his dear Son. You read in the paper of these foreign powers, these
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:30.020]   tyrants, taking whole nations and moving them to another land, taking them out of
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.740]   their homeland, putting them in another. That's the sort of thing that we're
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.860]   reading about here. We are taken out of the grip, the tyranny, the territory of
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:42.360]   the devil, and are translated, put again into a new kingdom, into the kingdom of God's
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   dear Son.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   What does that do?
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:49.480]   Well, that's the way we are given liberty from the power of darkness.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   It means we are given light, it means we are given knowledge, we are given the whole armour
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:03.340]   of God, we are given order, we are given law, we are given truth, we are given righteousness,
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:09.020]   we are given understanding about ourselves, about God, about time, death, eternity, all
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   is here before us.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.100]   Light, truth, knowledge, understanding.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.900]   What am I talking of?
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.060]   We are given something infinitely bigger.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.220]   We are joined to the Son of God.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.500]   We are put in Christ.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.100]   We are the body, He is the head.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.500]   We belong to Him, and all His strength and power becomes ours.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.400]   We are quickened with Him, we are raised with Him, we are seated in the heavenly places
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.340]   in Him, and all His might and power comes flooding through us.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:43.540]   "Of His fullness have we received," says John, "and grace upon grace."
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:49.620]   Be strong in the Lord, says Paul to the Ephesians, be strong in the Lord and in the power of
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.620]   His might.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.660]   Not only that, we have His sympathy, His help.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.340]   He was tempted in all points like us, we are yet without sin.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.260]   We have not an high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.100]   tempted in all points like us, we are.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.900]   He knows all about us.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.580]   In every pain that rends the heart, the man of sorrows bears a part.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.060]   Your deliverer and mine has been in this world.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:19.260]   He has met it all at its worst, at its devilest, at its most hellish aspect.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.020]   He has triumphed and conquered, and He is with us.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:27.460]   We are in Him and He is in us, and His strength and His power, His sympathy and His understanding
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.180]   are available for us.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.740]   What is the result of this?
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:36.300]   Oh, this is the most glorious thing that John says in his first epistle.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:43.300]   Listen, "We know that whosoever is born of God does not go on sinning, but he that is
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:53.900]   begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.340]   He can't touch Him.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.580]   When you are translated out of the power of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:06.100]   Son, you are put into a realm where the devil can never get you back into his power again.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.700]   You may be fool enough and mad enough to listen to him occasionally, but you will never be
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   back in his power.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.180]   You are in the power of Christ.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.460]   You are the slave of Christ.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.940]   You are in the kingdom of Christ.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.660]   You are in the whole power and rule and reign of Christ.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.460]   And the evil one cannot touch you.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.760]   He will never get you back into his embrace again.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.940]   You may fall, but you will never remain down.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.620]   You will be raised by Christ.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.300]   Your backslidings will be healed.
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.460]   You are in the power of the Son of God, and he will never let you go.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.460]   So that we can say with the great apostle Paul that neither death nor life nor angels
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:42.900]   nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.380]   any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.020]   Jesus our Lord.
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.620]   And do you know the result of all this?
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:56.860]   Well, here it is, when the devil comes and tries to get you down as he tempted the Lord
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.980]   himself in the wilderness, this is what you can say.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.940]   Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.940]   From you.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:11.780]   He got everybody down, Abram, patriarchs, prophets, kings, but if you in Christ resist
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.140]   him he will flee from you.
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.260]   Or listen to the way Peter puts the same thing.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.260]   Here he is.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:24.460]   Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil roams about seeking whom he may
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:32.060]   devour, whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.980]   in your brethren that are in the world.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.900]   Here it is, you see.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.820]   Because we are in the kingdom of God's dear Son, because the strength of Christ is in
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:46.540]   us, when the devil comes we can resist him, steadfast in the faith, strong in the Lord
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:52.140]   and in the power of his might, and he'll have to leave us as he left the Son of God.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:57.820]   It is the only way where anybody can ever be delivered from the power of darkness.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:04.020]   We need to be delivered and to be translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son, so that
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:09.220]   in our hour of desperate need and trial we turn to him and we say, "I need thee every
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.220]   hour."
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:16.940]   Stay thou nearby, temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.780]   I fear no foe with thee attend to bless.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:26.300]   Fears have no ill, no tears, and tears no bitterness.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.180]   Where is death's sting?
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.820]   Where, O grave, thy victory?
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:39.740]   I triumph still if thou abide with me.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:45.620]   My dear friends, that's why the world is as it is tonight, this terrible power, the power
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.980]   of darkness.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.380]   And you'll never set yourself free.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.860]   Start being psychoanalyzed and you'll never be right.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.540]   Nor your children.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.540]   The thing is hopeless.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:01.900]   There is only one power, it is the power of the Son of God, the new man, the second Adam,
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.660]   the last man, the Son of God.
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:11.820]   Come in the flesh, he has the power and he can deliver you and put you into his own kingdom.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.620]   And he not only saves, but he keeps.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:23.940]   We are not only saved by the power of God, we are kept by the power of God until we safely
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:31.860]   arrive at that inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, which
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:39.220]   is reserved and kept by God for his people and his children in the safety of heaven and
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.540]   the everlasting glory.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.820]   My dear friend, can't you see it?
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:49.860]   If you are not thanking God at this moment, it's because you never realized your bondage,
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.620]   you've never realized that it is God alone who can set you free in the Son of his love
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.820]   whom he sent to deliver you and to liberate you and to emancipate you.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.100]   Are you thanking God?
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.140]   Do you know that you've been set free?
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.140]   Have you been delivered from the power of darkness?
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.260]   If not, you're not a Christian.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.580]   I don't care how good you are.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:17.460]   You're a failure, you're a slave, you're a serf-spit.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.180]   Try as you will, you'll never find liberty.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:29.300]   But abandon yourself to him, he'll set you free, he'll make you strong, he'll keep you.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:33.820]   Ask him to enlighten you in darkness.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.340]   Ask him to wake your spirit.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:43.740]   Holy Spirit, truth divine, dawn upon this soul of mine.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:50.220]   Word of God and inward light, wake my spirit.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:53.180]   Clear my sight.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.700]   Ask him for the enlightenment that he alone can give.
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.700]   You'll find it in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:05.700]   Trust to him, he'll deliver you, he'll set you free, and he'll keep you free until you
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:14.980]   finally find yourself in that eternal glory who hath delivered us from the power of darkness
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:21.020]   and translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.460]   Blessed be the name of God.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
