[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   - Hey, Joshua.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.280]   My question was about...it was kind of hoping to have you elaborate on a previous
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.200]   Q&A show that you did.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.120]   I don't know.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.920]   It was a few months ago now.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.560]   And it was basically you were talking about the state of the United States and I
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.440]   think it was called the Growing Debt Bomb.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.760]   And then maybe you tied it into a Q&A later.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.680]   But anyway, I've been thinking about some of your suggestions as far as preparing for,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.720]   you know, a financial crisis and talking over with my wife.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.480]   And she actually thought of this question and it was about how you or what type of
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.400]   solution you would use for medical insurance.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160]   We have two kids, another one on the way.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.320]   And so that's a big deal for me.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.960]   Not that I'm necessarily considering moving or, you know, doing, you know,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   three months in, you know, one country and three months in another.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.480]   You know, whatever situation you find yourself in today, it's probably not going
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.680]   to be for me anytime soon.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   But one of the issues that we thought about was, you know, we have great medical
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.640]   coverage here in the U.S.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.000]   And, you know, being able to find a good doctor in another country,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.280]   first, how you would even go about...
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.440]   You know, I don't know anything about the health share ministries.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.560]   And I know you use one.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.440]   And so I thought maybe you could elaborate on that and the solution that you came up
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.760]   with for yourself and your family.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.840]   - Sure.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.400]   Do you and/or any of your family members have any significant ongoing health
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   conditions, any major chronic diseases or acute illnesses that you're facing?
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.880]   - No, we don't.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.040]   We actually happen to be pregnant right now.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.760]   - Congratulations.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.160]   - But no, thank you.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.040]   Nothing that we're concerned about right now.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.800]   I have some back issues that I've had for a while, but I don't intend to have surgery.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.040]   I hope that I never have to.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   But it's in the back of my mind that someday that could be the case.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.640]   But no, to answer your question, there's no cancer, you know, heart issues,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.280]   anything like that.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.160]   We're healthy for the most part.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   - So the reason I want to begin with that question is because most of the time,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.840]   people who ask a question related to health insurance, especially on a show like mine,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.920]   are simply very thoughtful, careful people who like to be prepared for all situations.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.480]   And I like that, right?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   That's a great character trait to have.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.760]   It's a great quality to have.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.840]   But what I have observed over the years is, I don't know why, but there just seems to be
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.560]   this almost obsession with being protected from any kind of medical issue that could
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.160]   happen, and I have observed that sometimes it keeps people from doing things that could
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.360]   otherwise be done.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.080]   For example, I have a friend of mine who, in his case, he does have significant medical
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.400]   issues, but he has worked for 15 years at a job that he doesn't like, that he isn't well
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.360]   suited for, and he works there exclusively for the medical insurance because it's a good
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.600]   government job.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.080]   Meanwhile, he's miserable and he's going to die because he has no quality of life.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.600]   And I'm convinced, not being a medical professional, I'm convinced that if he would just simply
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.000]   quit his job and pursue an alternative path, that he could improve his health so much that
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.760]   he wouldn't need his extremely expensive ongoing health care stuff that he has.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.800]   Now, he isn't interested, and so he doesn't do it, and I think all of us should be free
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.520]   to make our own choices.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.020]   But I've just observed so many people make life decisions that really don't make much
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.200]   sense all around this idea of having medical coverage.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.600]   And I've especially observed this among healthy people, healthy young people who have an idea
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.120]   for something they want to do, for that job they'd like to change, or a business they'd
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.800]   like to start, and they can't figure out, "How do I afford the health insurance?"
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.720]   And I have to concede, although I will never be advocating for governmental solutions,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.480]   I have to concede that one of the arguments that really I think is compelling in favor
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.120]   of the government-provided health care options is simply that it can free people up from
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.400]   worrying about chasing their, from worrying about trying to do something so that they
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.080]   can maintain health coverage.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.800]   So statistically, if you are young and healthy, and statistically if you're in good shape
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.280]   and you don't have any ongoing major health issues, you're probably not going to need
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   anything significant.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.200]   I mean, it's probably not, you're probably not going to have major health expenses.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.080]   Now that would be different if you were 75 years old and you had a whole bunch of risk
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.440]   factors, but most young families don't have a lot of health expenses.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.520]   So that's a little wordy, but I want to put things into perspective that chances are you're
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   probably going to be fine even if you didn't have any kind of health coverage.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.240]   And even if you didn't have any health insurance, you didn't have a plan, you didn't have anything
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.920]   in place, you're probably going to be fine.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.760]   Legally speaking, in today's world, in the United States, you're still going to be especially
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   fine because now that there's no pre-existing condition clauses for any official health
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.840]   insurance policies, as long as you can make it to an open enrollment period, no matter
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760]   what happens with your health, you can always sign up.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.000]   And if you have a fullness of understanding of the law, of everything that I talk about
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.600]   in this show, then going without health insurance is not that big of a risk.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.760]   Now, being a cautious person, being the kind of person who always wants to pay my bills,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.040]   being that kind of person and wanting to give that good kind of advice, I'm not advising
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.000]   to just say, "Throw caution to the wind and dump the health insurance."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.040]   Who cares?
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.760]   But I am trying to get people to think about it because for whatever reason, I've heard
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.080]   so many people that live in fear of losing health insurance and it doesn't seem that
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.560]   big of a deal to me.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.280]   At least if somebody doesn't have an ongoing condition or some other major risk factor
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   in place.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:04.200]   Now, secondly, I would point out in what you're alluding to of a discussion around the subject
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:12.840]   of having an economic crisis, I'm not advising people to leave the United States and go elsewhere
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.920]   unless they want to.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.840]   I can tell you how to do it if you want to do it.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.920]   It's what I've done, it's what I think is a good idea for many people, but that's not
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.000]   my major focus.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.960]   My major focus in what I've talked about in the past is to be prepared to survive an economic
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.920]   crisis and there could be many reasons why somebody would face an economic crisis.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.360]   One reason could be a health condition.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.600]   Many people face personal economic crises because they get sick, they get hurt and they
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   can't work.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.960]   So, I want you to be prepared for that and one way to be prepared for that is to have
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.840]   good health insurance, which is why in the course that I have called How to Survive and
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.440]   Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis, we talk a lot about that and it's not all
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   about leaving.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.160]   It's not all about running away and going somewhere else.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.440]   So maintaining good coverage is important, but it's also important to have backup plans
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.560]   in case you can't maintain good coverage.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   The most likely economic crisis that many people are going to face is simply the loss
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.680]   of a job.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.760]   Economic goes up where you live, you lose your job, your industry goes into a slump,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.840]   your region goes into a slump, etc. and you've got to pick up and move somewhere else.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.000]   And so, if you face something like that, you're going to be facing it no matter whether you
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.200]   go to the next state over, the next town over or the next country over.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.960]   So these are normal common problems and there are solutions to them along the way.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.200]   I would not recommend somebody that you just leave a disaster zone, you leave where you
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.760]   are just for fun.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.640]   So if you actually are facing a crisis, it's going to be apparent.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.360]   And one of the crises that many people are going to be facing is the loss of healthcare
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.840]   payment systems, healthcare coverage.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.960]   That is a basic component of what I talked about in the shows that I did on the debt
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.240]   bomb, basically.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.040]   The fact that no one wants to talk about the debt crisis.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.960]   Especially for older people.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.360]   There are three big entitlement programs that the United States government runs.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.120]   They are Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.240]   Social Security is currently the one that is making the news.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.640]   Various articles in the past months about the future insolvency of Social Security.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.160]   But Social Security is the most solvent of those three big entitlement programs and Social
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.880]   Security is the most easily solved.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.840]   Meaning that what they will do, in my opinion, this is not a guarantee, this is just my guess
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.480]   on what they will do, is they will institute a number of different changes to try to bring
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.320]   Social Security back towards actuarial solvency.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.760]   They will raise the retirement age, they'll do means testing if you have over a certain
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.320]   amount of money you can't get it, they'll change the benefit structures.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.560]   So that's fairly easily solved.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.280]   What's not easily solved is Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.160]   Medicaid is kind of a different animal, let's just focus on Medicare.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:06.640]   The basic problem of Medicare is that retirees are given massive health benefits that are
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   not paid for by the retiree and there aren't enough current tax revenues to provide the
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   health benefits.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.000]   So you have people living extremely long lives but yet paying massive amounts of medical
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.240]   expenses throughout those long lives.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.560]   And that can't continue, it can't be sustained.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.240]   And so even people who have a government paid system like Medicare, they're going to, in
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.480]   my opinion, face the problem of decreasing coverage.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.040]   What that looks like I don't know.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.160]   Maybe it looks like more stringent scrutiny of bills, maybe it looks like fewer things
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.340]   covered, maybe it looks like just decrepit government run hospitals is the only place
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.600]   you can get care and nobody goes to them because they don't function.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.920]   I don't know what it looks like.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.240]   But the crisis could be caused by lack of health care.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.280]   Now that's a little far afield from your question.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.680]   So I'd bring it back and say today, the cool thing is in today's world there are enough
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:11.000]   tools that nobody's life decisions should be frozen because of lack of access to health
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.200]   care coverage.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   I just, I can't comprehend why anybody should have their life choices frozen due to lack
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.600]   of health care coverage.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   There are so many different ways that we can exploit the system that we can figure out
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.640]   a plan for you and me as individuals to do well.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.480]   Even if you were chronically sick, we could work on a plan to allow you to do almost anything
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.680]   you need to do even if you're chronically sick by exploiting some of the things that
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.400]   we could figure out in your context.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.340]   But for just an average person, there are really neat options available.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.760]   So first, since some of the liberalization that has happened in the last year or two,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:58.480]   once again you can purchase high deductible health plans that have very high deductibles.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.160]   This is really important.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.940]   And this is, they're marketing these.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.240]   So to back up for a little bit, prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the health
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.200]   insurance industry could offer different types of medical insurance plans.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.540]   You could purchase Cadillac policies and you could purchase stripped out lien policies.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.360]   For people who are healthy, what I always like people to do was just to get a high deductible
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.240]   health plan that had a very high deductible but had a large coverage limit but that would
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.520]   be very cheap.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.040]   So a few hundred dollars a month, you would get something that had an unlimited or a million
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.440]   dollar cap on the total benefits that the policy could get.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:41.120]   But then you had a 10,000 or sometimes hopefully you could get a 20 or 30,000 or higher deductible
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.460]   up front.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.200]   That covers you from the really catastrophic risk of a catastrophic health condition.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.440]   A person who is healthy and who is financially prudent should be able to, in an emergency,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.960]   pay out of pocket 10 or 15 or 20,000 dollars for health expenses in an emergency.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.980]   What they can't pay out of pocket for usually is a million dollars of health expenses.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.440]   So those were available.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.320]   Then when the Affordable Care Act passed, it completely disrupted the individual health
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.600]   insurance marketplace with all of the mandates that had to be paid for, all of the care,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   etc.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.880]   Those policies basically got removed from the marketplace.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.880]   It was when those policies disappeared that I actually got out of the health insurance
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   business.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.360]   I previously had a health insurance license.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.800]   I would sell some individual health insurance and I just got out of the business because
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.640]   nobody was happy, the premiums were skyrocketing, etc.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.520]   So you couldn't really get those.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:42.400]   Now I have not stayed super in touch with the marketplace, but a few months ago I started
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   pricing again.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.540]   I started talking to health insurance brokers to see if in the wake of some of the liberalizations
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.840]   that happened when the Republicans took control of the Congress and President Trump was elected,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.320]   I started checking to see.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.160]   And yes, again, you're starting to see those kinds of policies available.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.600]   So I priced one out to see what they were and it wasn't unreasonable.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.880]   It wasn't as good as it was before, but you can today get a policy from some of the big
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.040]   major insurers that gives you basically that catastrophic coverage.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.800]   And I think that's something that a lot of people could find useful.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.880]   Now what it'll be labeled as, I think they call it a short-term health plan.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.080]   It was previously kind of a stopgap plan and they did that to come around some of the rules
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.640]   of the ACA and they're still marketing it, I think, as a short-term health plan.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.360]   But with policies like that, most people can afford to keep health insurance in place.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.240]   Now you alluded to the fact that I don't use health insurance myself.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.480]   I use a healthcare sharing ministry and I really, really love the concept of the healthcare
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   sharing ministries.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.520]   I really would like to promote them more in the future because I believe that they provide
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:53.480]   a very useful alternative for people to look at.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:00.080]   I like them from an ideological perspective because first, they rightly align the incentives
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.360]   of the consumer with the medical industry.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   So I don't have health insurance.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.680]   I always say I don't have health insurance.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.600]   I tell a doctor or someone, I don't have health insurance.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.880]   If I have health needs, I simply pay cash for them and then I take those expenses and
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.200]   then some of those expenses may qualify for reimbursement under the terms of my healthcare
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.960]   sharing ministry program.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.080]   I also really want to support them because they give people the right of choice.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   You get to choose the types of procedures that you're involved in.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.120]   You get to choose the type of people you do business with and that's extremely valuable.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:42.600]   It's a totally different experience working with a healthcare sharing ministry than any
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   insurance company.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.520]   My wife and I just had a baby.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.840]   This was our second baby that we've had using a healthcare sharing ministry and I actually
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.520]   literally at this moment have sitting on my desk a big stack of cards from all the people
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:04.960]   who sent us money for all of the medical expenses.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.120]   I've got this handful of cards here and I wasn't planning this.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.800]   I was just sorting through paperwork here but this is the kind of notes that we got.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.680]   We got Paul and Karen wrote us a note with a card with their check.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.720]   Praise God for new life.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.920]   We pray for you that you're doing well and that God's precious gift to you will be such
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.400]   a blessing and they go on.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.200]   There are other cards here.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.240]   Greg and Janet wrote us a note with congratulations saying they were praying for us with the arrival
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.400]   of our baby.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.880]   One of our fellow healthcare people wrote us a whole long page long letter with all
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.080]   kinds of resources that they'd found helpful and parenting tips and some books and things
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.720]   that they'd really liked and they wanted to share some of those ideas with us.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.840]   I find that refreshing.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.160]   It's so different than our first child I had on a health insurance policy and it was just
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.000]   dealing with the billing department all the time.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.040]   It was brutal.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   It's really, really wonderful.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.440]   Now to expenses.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.840]   One of the nice things about Samaritan Ministries that I use and I assume the other healthcare
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.000]   sharing ministries is you can do some things.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   They have a little more leeway sometimes than the health insurance companies seem to do.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.800]   For example, we did birth tourism.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.320]   We didn't have the baby in the United States.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.200]   With birth tourism there are various reasons why you can do birth tourism but one of the
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.720]   things you can do with birth tourism is you can save massive amounts of money.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.520]   If I didn't have health insurance paying for bills in the United States, I don't know why
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.200]   I would have a baby in the United States.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.220]   The medical system in the United States is so broken especially around childcare.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.720]   It's insanely expensive.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.840]   You can go to Mexico and you can have a baby for a hospital birth or even if you had a
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:47.040]   cesarean in Mexico your total fee is under $3,000 versus $15,000 to $30,000 in the United
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   States.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:54.640]   Well, under Samaritan Ministries all of my expenses are covered no matter where in the
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   world I happen to give birth.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.960]   They don't care.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.760]   There's some details there in terms of they don't cover – you have to work out the cost
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.920]   comparisons and things like that but there's a lot more leeway with things like that.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.240]   So I can use Samaritan Ministries, I can submit my bills for reimbursement no matter where
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.240]   they are.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.880]   And then I would finally point to just one more factor.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.200]   Don't forget that when traveling you have access to totally different medical systems.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.640]   The US medical system is broken.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.320]   It's absolutely broken.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.680]   Now we can argue as to why we think it's broken but I think most of us would agree that it's
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680]   largely broken.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.260]   I guess that the people who wouldn't say it's broken would say, "Well, you can get decent.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.120]   You can get really world-class medical care."
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.480]   And I think that's true.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.840]   You can get really world-class medical care.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.480]   But in terms of the feasibility of that, the costs are so astronomical and it seems like
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.900]   every time a new thing develops, a new opportunity where expenses can be saved, it seems like
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.200]   another bureaucrat comes in with more regulation that messes up that part of the market as
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   well.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.560]   But the rest of the world is not like that.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.560]   There's a massive booming medical tourism business in Mexico.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.520]   There's a massive medical tourism business in Central America, in Asia.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.680]   You can get world-class medical care.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.520]   You can save so much money by going abroad to have procedures done.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.900]   Now that doesn't work really well if you were just in a car accident and you got to be stitched
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.520]   together by a surgeon.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.400]   But it does work really well for any kind of elective procedure or any procedure where
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.180]   you have advance notice.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.160]   So just because you leave the United States doesn't mean that you can't get good medical
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:35.360]   care and in fact I'm more and more a proponent and an aficionado of people leaving the United
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.560]   States to get their medical care.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.480]   And if you're paying out of pocket for it or you're using some kind of useful interesting
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.880]   arrangement that provides for medical tourism, you can get it cheaper, better, abroad than
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   in the US.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.560]   So it's just not a concern.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.840]   There are doctors everywhere in the world and I think most of us who've traveled reasonably
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.600]   extensively would say there are some places where we really don't want to get sick, where
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.080]   things are just primitive.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.400]   Nobody denies that.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.320]   But in many cases there are many times I think many of us would say if we're going to get
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.520]   sick we'd rather get sick outside the United States than inside the United States because
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.560]   for every place that's primitive and really really rough there are equally a number and
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.560]   perhaps more places that you can get world-class care and not have your finances ruined by
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   it.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.680]   You got some response to that Ryan?
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   Follow-up questions?
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   I kind of gave you a little monologue there.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:40.480]   So that's great and I actually do have a follow-up question if you have time to take it.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.560]   It's related to the Defon that you've talked about before.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.400]   I think we can pretty much all agree that something more than likely it's going to be
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.640]   the tax man coming after you and I don't necessarily think it's going to be coming after your paycheck
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:03.720]   but rather your overall wealth and so I think that retirement plans, pensions, everything,
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.560]   anything that could be considered your wealth is probably going to be taxed in order to
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.720]   pay for all of these liabilities that we can't afford.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:18.280]   And so my question is about avoiding some of that taxation not necessarily on your income
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:24.760]   because on one of your previous podcasts, you talked about doing tourism or perpetual
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.800]   tourism or whatever in countries that won't tax your income or tax your business or whatever
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:37.200]   but what about taxing your assets or what about if you want to do perpetual tourism
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.000]   and you just want to live on say a combination of your retirement accounts, your savings
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.840]   account and a pension that you formerly had in the United States and then what countries
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.480]   would be on the Joshua Proof list to consider for doing something like that?
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:04.120]   Well so I think let me just clarify a couple of things because part of the problem that
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.800]   I have is I taught through this stuff systematically in my course but I didn't do it on the show.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.360]   I kind of just alluded to ideas.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   So first, perpetual tourism, the way that I define perpetual tourism is a strategy of
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:21.320]   moving from country to country and not becoming a resident and specifically not becoming a
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.080]   tax resident of any one particular country.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.120]   That's the concept of perpetual tourism.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.700]   Now for some people that seems really exciting.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.640]   For other people that's not really exciting.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.900]   You know the phase of life that I'm in for example and that you're in Ryan it sounds
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:41.000]   like when you've got two young children and you've got a third on the way, I would guess
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.680]   that your wife is probably not too thrilled about the idea of hey let's pick up and get
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.120]   on an airplane every three months and move from country to country.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.200]   Most of the time in our stage of life that's not usually a very conducive idea.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   Now there are people that go do it.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.880]   They go to spend a year with their kids traveling but just in terms of planning on that as a
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.000]   long term plan it's usually not very exciting.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.280]   That's different than a lot of times single people they want to go out and live that kind
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.420]   of strategy and I've interviewed people on the show who've done it and you can do it.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:17.540]   How I alluded to that in the context of economic crisis was probably simply to say that if
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:25.020]   your home country is going through a massive global worldwide, sorry not global, countrywide
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.020]   economic crisis.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.660]   Like let's say that you were, Venezuela is a bad example because it's just so dire there
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:37.340]   but let's, I don't know a better one right now so let's just go with that.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.460]   You're from Venezuela and a year and a half ago, two years ago before the government ran
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:48.140]   out of passports, passport paper and stopped issuing passports you got your passports together
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.860]   and you left the country.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.100]   Well as a Venezuelan maybe you don't have easy access for a residency permit in another
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:01.460]   country but if you just spent your time traveling among a group of countries that give you access
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:09.180]   as a Venezuelan with a Venezuelan passport then you could just simply keep moving from
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:14.060]   time to time and stay outside of Venezuela thus avoiding the starvation and the violence
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:19.000]   and all of that while simultaneously being able to stay within the law of other countries
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.540]   until you could ultimately get a residency permit in another country.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.700]   So I don't know all the Venezuela passport restrictions but if you put together a little
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:33.660]   tour of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and you know that's enough and you just spent
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.660]   three months in each of those four countries then you would not violate any visa agreements
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.100]   and you would be able to live.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.140]   So US Americans could have this as a good backup plan.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.540]   So hey if there's a problem in the United States of America I can get out and I can
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:54.420]   go to Canada, I can go to England, I can go to New Zealand, I'm focusing on English speaking
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.340]   countries here and I can just kind of bounce between those using just simply tourist visas.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.060]   So that's what I alluded to with perpetual tourism.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.460]   Now from a tax perspective let's come to taxes.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.860]   One of the advantages that US Americans do have with a US passport is you don't have
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:18.480]   to become a tax resident of a certain country in order to qualify, in order to activate
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   the foreign earned income exclusion as we talked about for US taxes.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   Other countries do.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.180]   So if you're Canadian and you want to leave the Canadian tax system you have to go and
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.260]   become a resident of another place.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.900]   You can't just bounce around the globe but US Americans don't have to do that.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.080]   Americans are going to simply be out of the country and as long as you're out of the country
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.740]   more than 330 days per year you can qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion and
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.500]   you can avoid the US income taxation on about your first hundred thousand dollars of foreign
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.940]   earned income for the US tax code.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.140]   So you can go and set up in another place.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.180]   Now that doesn't solve the wealth problem because you're still going to pay capital
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:59.940]   gains taxes, you'll still pay dividend taxes, etc. and if there are changes in the US tax
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:05.360]   code then you would be subject to those and you cannot avoid those as a US citizen.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.580]   You cannot avoid those simply by changing your residency.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:14.020]   Even if you moved from Florida to the Bahamas which has no income taxes, which has no wealth
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:19.380]   taxes, which has no inheritance taxes, even if you did that as long as you retain your
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:25.700]   US citizenship you will still be subject to US income taxes, US wealth taxes if new ones
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:31.780]   are instituted, inheritance taxes such as the estate taxes, etc. as a US citizen.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:39.140]   So your only pathway to avoid wealth taxes is, well let me say, your only legal pathway
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:44.540]   you could always do tax evasion and play the game of they're not knowledgeable about my
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.300]   assets that's a risky game but probably doable to some extent.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:53.140]   But the only legal way to do it is going to be to renounce US citizenship.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:59.620]   So what I would say is this, I don't think that the fear of going and I don't think that
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:08.100]   the fear right now of moving abroad and the fear that in the future the United States
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.180]   will impose wealth taxes and start taking more tax money from your IRA and from your
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.900]   Roth IRA, I don't think that the fear of that should be sufficient for you to say well that's
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.860]   it I'm done being a US citizen.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:24.260]   But I do think the potential of it should have you working on a plan to make sure that
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:29.580]   if you ever did want to renounce US citizenship you have that as an option.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.220]   And I would say that this is the only practical solution that I see for avoiding the taxes
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.260]   and for helping your children.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.580]   Because at this point in time what do people say?
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.540]   Nobody thinks that you and I are going to pay the bills of the United States, unless
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.700]   we're young.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.100]   But most 50 year olds say well it's obvious to us that the United States government is
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.620]   deeply in debt, it's obvious to us that we're never going to pay this debt back.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.420]   But we're putting it onto our children and our children's children.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:00.540]   Well my solution Ryan, if you want your children and your children's children to have a choice
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.460]   you've got to set them up so that they can move themselves out of from under the US tax
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.780]   system in the future if taxes become onerous into another tax system.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.360]   And there are, if you study the tax systems to your question of jurisdictions, depending
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.580]   on the makeup of your wealth there are many jurisdictions that you could choose that would
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.580]   be favorable to you.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.320]   Let me give you a couple of examples.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:28.460]   In the three part series that I talked about I alluded to choosing different jurisdictions
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.060]   based upon income.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.800]   If somebody earns, I don't know, a modest amount of money I think they would be well
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.260]   served, just a little bit of money, I think that they would be well served by staying
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:43.300]   in the United States because everything is cheaper in the United States generally than
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.100]   most places around the world.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.380]   And so somebody earning $40,000 or $50,000 is going to probably be better off in my opinion
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.940]   in the United States than moving to another country.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.660]   Unless they have an affinity for that and they can live cheap in the other country.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.900]   But most people, you can get things so much cheaper in the United States that quality
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.940]   of life is probably going to be higher.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:06.980]   So but there's no reason not to move to a no state income tax jurisdiction if you can.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.540]   Now then I talked about going international.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:14.580]   I said if you're earning, I don't know, a few hundred thousand dollars of taxable income
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:19.400]   then going outside the United States is a really good solution to save you on taxes.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.700]   Then I went one step further with the Puerto Rico taxes and I said going to Puerto Rico
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.000]   is not good if you make $100,000 a year but if you make a million dollars a year then
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.540]   Puerto Rico could serve you really well.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.640]   Now I didn't go on with the series and assume that it's for non-US citizens but if you go
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.740]   on one more step and you start to look around the world then you can find other jurisdictions.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:44.360]   There are jurisdictions that tax income but don't tax capital gains or don't tax dividends.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:50.900]   So if your income is primarily capital gains income and not earned income you can do very
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.660]   well as a resident there.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.160]   Think Singapore here for example.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.320]   Or if your income is largely earned income but not capital gains income then you need
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.420]   to go to a destination that doesn't tax earned income.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.580]   My action step for you Ryan is simply this.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.300]   I don't think you should worry about it.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.820]   I think what you should do and you and your wife should talk about is let's say that our
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.360]   children, our two young children and soon to be born third, if our children are in a
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.500]   situation where their taxes are doubling and tripling and they're connected to it with
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.300]   a country that has a military empire that can follow them to the ends of the earth then
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.980]   how do we set them up so that they can move abroad, so that they can move to another citizenship
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:37.020]   and so that they can renounce their US citizenship and eliminate the tax net.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.620]   Now that's not to say that taxes can't change right now.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.060]   You owe exit taxes.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.500]   If you haven't, there are a few different triggers but the big one is if you have a
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.160]   net worth of more than two million dollars the US government will impose exit taxes on
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.620]   you when you renounce citizenship.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:56.220]   But at the very least Ryan, go have a baby in Canada or go have a baby in Mexico and
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.020]   make sure that you're on the track.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.820]   Your baby has a second citizenship from birth.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.980]   Put your other family on track for a second citizenship.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.180]   Have you ever thought about this or researched this area of line of thinking Ryan?
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.980]   Ryan Neuhofel I mean it's entertaining to me to think about
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.340]   but honestly I couldn't see my wife signing up for having a baby in another country.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.740]   I mean just with our parents alone they'd probably, who knows.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.780]   So it's fun to think about.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.780]   It's a great thought experiment but I can't see it happening.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.780]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.900]   Well, I think a lot of people are in that situation and I don't do it if she doesn't
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   want to.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.500]   But let me just give you just a couple of thoughts on it.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.520]   So first of all, it is possible.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:50.500]   People go and have babies all the time in other places and depending on the type of
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:59.100]   birth experience that you and your wife like to have, that can put you in different jurisdictions.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:04.180]   If you, for example, like to have a hospital birth, hospitals all pretty much look the
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.460]   same no matter what country you're in.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.940]   It doesn't look, you know, a hospital in Florida looks about the same as a hospital in Toronto.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.420]   It's a hospital.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.820]   But the only difference is if you have your baby in Toronto, then that baby is a Canadian
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.620]   citizen by birth.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.820]   That doesn't do anything for you immigration-wise to Canada for you but it does mean that your
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:28.780]   child can have a Canadian passport or Mexico if you have your baby in Mexico.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.460]   Mexican hospitals, you might need to speak a little Spanish.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.900]   That's different than the Canadian hospital but if you have your baby in a Mexican hospital,
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   then your baby will automatically qualify to be a Mexican citizen by birth and you can
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.700]   think and register him as a dual citizen.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.820]   And the advantage of a Mexican, if you have a Mexican baby is if you're the parent of
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:53.300]   a Mexican baby, then you can apply for Mexican residency and be issued a resident permit
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:59.580]   for you and your wife and your other children as well without any other tests necessary
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.180]   simply due to their reunification of family theory.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.980]   And there are other countries around the world that you can look at as well.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.600]   Now I will be the first to concede it's not easy.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.940]   So if you're in a town where everyone is there, you know, it's not easy.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:19.220]   But it is doable and it's something that I think I want to encourage more and more people
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.020]   to pursue it and to research it and to think about it because I think it's really, it's
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:28.180]   the only practical solution that I can see is to help your children develop secondary
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:34.060]   citizenships so that if in the future they need to leave a confiscatory tax regime, then
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.060]   they have already in place a second citizenship so they can renounce their primary citizenship.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.820]   And it's not anything against the US or any other country, it's just a reality.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.660]   In the United States, most US Americans don't think much about it, but much of the rest
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.620]   of the world does because they've seen the value of it.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.660]   But it's really the only solution that I see.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.540]   The most famous big money example of it was Eduardo Saverin, one of the early employees
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   at Facebook.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:05.860]   He was Brazilian, dual citizen by birth, born in Brazil, became a US citizen and then was
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:11.900]   able to renounce his citizenship from the United States and in his case I think he became
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.740]   a Singaporean citizen.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.100]   Now he had to pay a lot of exit taxes on the way out.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.820]   He was taxed very heavily by the United States, but he still saved, I don't know if it was
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.340]   tens of millions or hundreds of millions, but he still saved a massive amount of money
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.340]   by renouncing his US citizenship prior to the IPO of Facebook.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.900]   And so I think of it like that for children.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.740]   If they have the choice, they may never need it, but they're not hurt by having it.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.500]   But you don't have to just do birth tourism, you can buy second citizenships, you can go
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.220]   and establish residency abroad and work on a residency program and I think it's just
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.700]   well worth having in the back of your mind because in my opinion the only answer to your
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.740]   question of how do I avoid a wealth tax, if you live in a country that taxes you on your
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:58.300]   worldwide income and your worldwide wealth like the United States does, the only solution
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.180]   is to simply leave and get yourself out from under their taxing authority.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:09.660]   >>TED: Okay, I mean that makes sense.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.860]   >>STEVE: You don't sound super excited.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.140]   I don't think you're going to successfully convince your wife, but that's okay, you don't
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   have to.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.140]   But I'm sure there are other listeners who will be interested.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.300]   >>TED: Yeah, so it's not something that I'm thinking of imminently.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:32.660]   I mean you mentioned in your podcast you see the debt bomb exploding in your lifetime.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.180]   Well, I kind of feel the same way.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:41.020]   I don't feel like, I mean I think we can do QE four, five, six and seven before truly
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.980]   no one's going to extend us any more credit and the debt bomb's going to explode and who
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.260]   knows how many years that could be.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:51.740]   I just want to be thinking about these options as maybe I'll be in retirement by the time
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.980]   that happens.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:37:00.740]   I just want to be somewhat prepared, at least have some of the stuff before it comes due.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.300]   >>STEVE: Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:08.100]   And so I don't see, and I think the fact that you are thinking about the solutions is probably
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.900]   about all you need to do at this point in time.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:16.540]   And I think there are some basic things, as I talk about in the course that I made, there
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.680]   are some basic steps that can be taken and should be taken.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.620]   But just simply thinking about it is more than most people.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.380]   Most people are not thinking about it.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.980]   They're not considering it.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:30.940]   So I'm not worried about anything in the near term.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.460]   Certainly I think we always face the potential for short-term economic problems.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:43.740]   But I think more likely is just kind of a slow malaise and a long, slow period of not
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:48.380]   much fun and excitement happening.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.660]   But I don't see any kind of short-term scenario.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.940]   So I would just say, as your wealth grows, just keep an eye on it.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:00.400]   If you have $100,000 of net worth, there's no point in doing much other than focusing
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.940]   on building your net worth.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.860]   When you have a net worth of a million dollars, just start to look at it.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.100]   I think by the time you get to a net worth of a million dollars, a good portion of your
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.020]   assets should be internationalized.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.620]   But that's not as hard and fast rule.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.140]   As you start to get to a couple of million dollars, I think you should be looking carefully
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.140]   at it.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.020]   Even at a couple of million dollars, I wouldn't do anything.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.980]   But if you start to get much more than that, you should be paying attention.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.560]   And in my mind, the only thing that we can do at this point is just watch the news, watch
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.140]   the tone in the country, and see what people start to do.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:39.700]   Now I don't have much optimism that things will change, because as best I can see, it
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:46.260]   seems like in the United States we have developed a citizenry of people, or a voter base at
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.180]   least, of people who believe that what belongs to other people belongs to them if they can
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.580]   just vote for it.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:59.740]   Now at the moment, it seems like it's just more talk than it is action.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.380]   You know, it's watch the 2020 presidential elections, watch the next few election cycles
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.900]   and see what happens.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.140]   But I do think that if you live in a citizenry of people who are greedy and jealous and think
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.460]   that it's all your fault just because you're rich and all they have to do is get together
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.700]   with a few million other neighbors and take from you, then that should be illustrative.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:24.780]   Now if we see somehow some kind of principled resurgence of a live and let live and, you
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.500]   know, I'm not going to steal from my neighbor some kind of conservative political revival,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.460]   I don't see any way that can happen.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.900]   But if that happens, then I would be less worried.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.420]   But in your own personal decisions, there may come a time when you have a job option
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.580]   and you're looking at taking a job in Jacksonville, but you're also thinking about taking a job
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.020]   in Zurich.
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.180]   And you look at it and say, you know what, I'm going to pursue the job in Zurich.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.500]   There's no reason to stay.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:54.660]   Go to Zurich and start setting up a life there and just start the process little by little.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.600]   My hope is that just by exposing people to the ideas and the concept that they'll start
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:05.180]   to look and then if the cost for you becomes significant, that's when you start acting.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:11.220]   I don't think it makes sense to take big decisions if you're not actually paying a personal price.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:17.100]   If you don't have a big tax bill or they're not coming after your wealth, then why go
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.360]   through all the expense of leaving?
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:24.060]   But if you do start to develop significant assets, then keep in the back of your mind,
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.540]   how would I get out if the climate becomes worse?
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.540]   Your guess is as good as mine.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.380]   I think we just watch and see what happens.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.860]   >> Ryan: Great.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.860]   Thanks.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:34.860]   That's very helpful.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.300]   >> Chris: Any other questions, Ryan?
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   Any other comments or questions?
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.660]   Did I clarify the stuff on the medical tourism thing?
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.660]   >> Ryan: Yeah.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.660]   I think that makes sense.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:48.500]   >> Chris: Here would be my only comment.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.740]   My only comment is you're talking maybe with your wife and for anyone else that's in the
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.740]   situation.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.980]   I have a lot of good things to say about the United States of America and I think we should
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.780]   be cautious about thinking that it's just better other places.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.580]   It's easy to think that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence until you actually
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.740]   go to the other side of the fence and check out the grass.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.580]   I would just say on some metrics, there's another place somewhere in the world that's
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.660]   usually better on almost any one thing.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:23.380]   But if your wife is, let's say that you could probably as you talk with your wife, try to
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.020]   figure out what the things are that would be important for her.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.420]   I would just say the first thing is that most Americans can do is most Americans should
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.500]   go and just simply travel a little bit more.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   I don't know.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.340]   Have you traveled a lot internationally, Ryan?
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.900]   Not internationally, no.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.900]   Okay.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.900]   So what I would recommend...
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   I've been to Canada.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.900]   That's it.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   So that doesn't...
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.540]   It counts a little bit, I guess, but not much.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.660]   So here'd be my recommendation.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.100]   Don't go to Mexico.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.520]   I like Mexico, but don't go to Mexico.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.260]   Don't go to South America.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:05.660]   Schedule a family vacation to Asia and take a little tour of Singapore and Hong Kong and
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.740]   Kuala Lumpur.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.740]   Schedule a...
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.140]   Go to Dubai.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.740]   Schedule a family vacation to Dubai.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.020]   Go to China.
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:21.100]   Go to Shanghai and start to see what's happening in the rest of the world.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.580]   The first time I went to Hong Kong, I had never been to...
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.380]   As I can remember, I'd not really been to a big city outside the United States.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.300]   And I always thought that the United States was great.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.860]   I thought that New York was great.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:39.940]   And then I had been to England, I'd been to London, but it didn't do anything for me.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.340]   But I remember the first time I went to Hong Kong.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.980]   And I got on the Hong Kong Metro.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.500]   I can't remember what they call it, the subway system.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.340]   And I was just stunned at how incredible the subway system was.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:59.180]   And I walked around downtown Hong Kong on the island, and I could not believe what I
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.300]   was seeing.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.620]   And it made New York look like the armpit of the earth.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.120]   It just was terrible.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.060]   Everything was bigger, everything was nicer, everything was fancier, everything was cleaner,
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.380]   everything was faster, everything worked better.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.060]   And then it just went on from there.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.780]   I haven't been to Dubai yet, but it's on my list.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.280]   I'd like to get to Dubai.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.500]   But I've seen the pictures of Dubai, and you look at what's happening in some of these
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.140]   centers, and it's very hard to go back to the United States and make the argument that
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.100]   the future is in the United States.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.140]   Now I think that it would be false to do it just based upon the cities.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.860]   But if you are impressed by big cities and things, just get a plane ticket, schedule
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.380]   family vacation, and don't go to a beach.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.540]   Go to some place where you start to see, wait a second, the rest of the world hasn't been
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.260]   sitting around doing nothing.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.100]   I could live very happily in Singapore.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.220]   I could live very happily in Kuala Lumpur.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.660]   I could live happily in a lot of places.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.160]   But in Mexico City, there's so many wonderful places.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.380]   And I think that's the big thing that you can start to do, is just start to travel a
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.540]   little internationally, pay the money, and it'll probably start to change your perspective
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.660]   on the United States.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.260]   I think the United States is going to be in a long, slow decline over the coming decades.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.260]   That's the best I can see.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.500]   I don't see any reason for kind of cultural optimism.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:18.180]   Basically we have developed a citizenry of people who are, in my opinion, fairly lazy,
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:25.580]   fairly entitled, have this concept that basically everything, we're the best in everything.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:31.100]   And I don't see any foundational standpoint for a lot of optimism.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.660]   But that doesn't mean that the rest of the world is standing still.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.940]   So get out and travel, and see if you agree with me, see if you disagree with me.
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.620]   But that's what I would do.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:43.660]   Probably not the best time to start, but research, at least think about birth tourism, but at
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.140]   least get out and travel, and see what you guys think about the rest of the world.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.980]   - Great, yeah, thank you.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:59.260]   - I hope, it's always troubling to make broad sweeping statements like I've just made.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:03.460]   I hope I've given enough caveats and such to say, when I'm talking about this stuff,
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.860]   I don't mean anything acute, I'm talking about long term.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.340]   I guess I just want to point out one more thing.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.580]   The key is you as an individual.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.820]   Question is, where can you succeed?
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:19.700]   Because what I think is happening in the United States, you can succeed like crazy in the
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.700]   United States.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:28.620]   There are so many opportunities for so many people to be successful in the United States.
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.660]   That's different than the general population.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:38.220]   I think if you go back and you look at Charles Murray's book, Coming Apart, he traced this
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:44.140]   out so perfectly, I don't know what other resource I could cite, where he clearly, and
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:50.020]   in my opinion, overwhelmingly demonstrated the fact that the upper class elite in the
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:53.300]   United States are doing better than ever before.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.540]   And frankly, that's probably who you and I are.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:01.140]   But that doesn't mean that the country is necessarily going to do better than ever before.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.860]   So you try to figure out where do you succeed.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.780]   Good chance for many of us, most of us, that's in the United States.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.300]   But you got to work within the system and recognize that just because you're doing well
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.340]   doesn't mean that everybody's doing well.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.780]   And that could be dangerous in a population where you're doing well, but the people are
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.100]   not doing well in general.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.980]   That could be very dangerous, could be dangerous to your health and wealth.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.220]   But you might not want to live in Dubai, you might not want to work in Singapore, you might
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.260]   not want to go to some of those places.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.460]   In which case, just enjoy the lifestyle benefits of where you are.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.500]   So I made some big sweeping statements.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.420]   I think they're right, but time will tell.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.300]   We watch over the coming years and see what happens.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.180]   But my only thing, I love the United States, I wish nothing but good things for the United
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.180]   States.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:53.540]   I just don't see the source of those good things on a large level.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:59.220]   I think that small groups of people who live very counter-culturally can do very well.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:06.140]   But on a broad basis, I don't see the reasons for optimism on the broad basis.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.300]   Hopefully that was enough backpedaling and whatnot to make it come through.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.580]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:27.940]   I'll be back with you very soon.
