[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   I should like to call your attention this evening to three verses in the 21st chapter
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.360]   of the Gospel according to St. Luke, which we read at the beginning, namely verses 34,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.680]   35, and 36.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:22.120]   Verses 34, 35, and 36 in the 21st chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.120]   "And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.400]   and drunkenness and cares of this life.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.740]   And so that day come upon you unawares as a snare, for it shall come on all them that
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.520]   dwell on the face of the whole earth.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.380]   Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.640]   things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man."
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.920]   Now I changed the translation just a little there, because I think that as I read it now,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.560]   it is a little better than as I have it here before me in this authorized version.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.440]   It doesn't really change the meaning at all, but it makes it read better.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.680]   Now here we have our Lord uttering these words at the end of this discourse which he delivered
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.300]   just before his death upon the cross.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.360]   Now the very circumstances in which he came to speak these words in and of themselves
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.920]   attach of course great significance to what he said.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.800]   He knew he was going to die.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.120]   He spoke as a man who knew that he was speaking probably in extenso like this for the last
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.240]   time.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.360]   The dying words of all men are important.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.120]   Any man who knows that he's about to die doesn't speak libly, lightly, or loosely.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.280]   He weighs and measures his words.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.240]   And our Lord knew exactly what was about to happen when he uttered this great statement.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.340]   And what he deals with here of course is the future.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.960]   He was looking into the future.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.900]   He was giving a prophecy.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.320]   He was telling these people who were listening to him of things that were going to happen.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   And he commits himself very definitely to certain specific statements.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.040]   Now that is the burden of this message.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.840]   It's our Lord giving a kind of preview, a foreview, of history.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.000]   I'm calling attention to it because it is of course a very vital and essential part
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   of his teaching.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.080]   All that we have here is his teaching and it is our business to pay attention to all
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.440]   of it.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   This is as much a part of our Lord's teaching as the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.360]   It's as much a part of his teaching as is the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.900]   And yet I think we'll all plead guilty to a tendency to neglect this aspect of his teaching
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.200]   and to concentrate on the other.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Some only turn to the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.960]   Some only turn to the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.160]   But it's a very false way to approach the teaching of any teacher.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.240]   It is supreme folly to do that kind of thing with the teaching of one who claims to be
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.960]   the son of God incarnate in this world of time.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:37.320]   Very well then, here is a very great and a very important and a very vital statement.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.120]   And therefore the first thing we have to do is to recognize in general as to what it's
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.960]   about.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.640]   And I think most people would agree that there are two main matters dealt with in this chapter.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.400]   The one was the immediate future history of the Jews and of Jerusalem.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.760]   There is no doubt that he deals primarily with that.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.200]   He was foretelling what was about to happen in a few years to the Jews, the children of
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.880]   Israel who had refused him and who were determined to bring about his death.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.960]   He knew all that.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.440]   He knew what they were doing.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.840]   He knew all about the machinations of the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and the
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.960]   doctors of the law.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.320]   He knew exactly what was happening.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.860]   And so he prophesies and predicts what was going to happen to them as a nation and as
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.120]   to what was to happen especially to their great city of Jerusalem.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.840]   Now there is no question at all but that verses 20 to 24 deal specifically with that.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.760]   When he shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.160]   is nigh and so on.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.880]   And he ends by saying and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.080]   away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.840]   the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.160]   That was the immediate prophecy.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   But it's equally clear that the prophecy is not confined to the immediate.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.680]   He looks beyond it.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.720]   There shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.840]   of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.920]   for fear and so on.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.760]   Now that was not an immediate prophecy concerning what was about to happen to Jerusalem.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.400]   Our Lord there is looking forward through the centuries.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.160]   He's looking right on to the very end of time.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.520]   He's looking on indeed to the very end of the world as the world has existed for so
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.920]   many centuries and as we think of the world this evening.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.000]   Here is a prophecy concerning the end of the world.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   Now my friends, I ask you, is there any subject that is more urgent for us to consider at
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.320]   this moment than just this?
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.720]   Is there anything more relevant than a consideration of this?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.440]   Look at our world this evening.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.080]   Look what's happening.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.960]   Far East, Africa, Western Hemisphere.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   Look at it all.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.040]   Well, you are looking at it all.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.560]   You are reading your papers, you are listening to the news and you see the unrest in the
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.680]   nations.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.360]   You see the whole state of the world and of the peoples and the nations of the world at
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.440]   this hour.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.560]   You read about these terrifying powers that have been unleashed by men with his inventive
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   genius and his scientific ability.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:55.160]   Now then, here is our world as it is this evening with all the uncertainty and the commotion.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.400]   I ask, is there anything that is so urgently important for us to do as to consider what
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.960]   our blessed Lord had to say here about the future course of history and about the end
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   of the world?
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:18.120]   Now, it's a very remarkable thing to notice the extraordinary change that has taken place
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.140]   in the general attitude of people to this particular subject.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:36.600]   Fifty years ago, and indeed almost right up until 1939, to deal with this subject in general,
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:44.480]   not only in the world but even in the Church, was to be regarded as being quite ridiculous.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.800]   Now it wasn't true of everybody.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.000]   There were certain Christian people who, believing their Bible, always preached on this and taught
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   it.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   But I say that speaking generally, ere less of the Christian Church, so called, and still
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.700]   more of the great world that is outside, to talk about the end of the world, up until
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:15.160]   about 1939, would indeed have been regarded almost as a sign of lunacy, of insanity.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.960]   It was something that was rarely treated with utter scorn and ridicule and derision.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   Why?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   Well, because, as they said, and it was particularly true before 1914, of course.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:38.360]   From about 1860 to 1914, the world seemed to be so settled.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:45.160]   The Pax Britannica, there hadn't been any great war had there since the Napoleonic Wars.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.600]   France had finally been conquered, that particular menace had gone, and a great era of peace
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.160]   had reigned.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.920]   The writers still talk about the halcyon days of the mid-Victorian and the late-Victorian
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.100]   and the Edwardian period.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.800]   Life seemed so settled, so stable.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.240]   Everything was going so well, men were advancing so rapidly, the humanitarian instinct was
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.940]   so much in evidence, the whole world was going forward steadily, surely, certainly, nothing
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.160]   could upset it, and there was a great new era about to dawn.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.600]   Indeed it had already started.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.720]   And to talk about the end of the world, it seemed, well, it was just a manifestation,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:41.880]   a sort of aberration of a mind that was unhinged and lacking in a sense of balance and of understanding.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.960]   It was just utter nonsense.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.360]   The end of the world, when the world in a sense was only just beginning?
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.680]   Men had dwelt in ignorance all through these centuries, and now the dawn is about to break,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.920]   and here are these fools talking about the end of the world.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.240]   It was ridiculed, laughed out of court.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.280]   It was such utter nonsense.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.400]   We were only at the beginning of real life and living.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.000]   The last thing to talk about was the end of the world.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.840]   But you know, it's no longer like that, is it?
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.440]   There has been a complete transformation in the whole situation.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.560]   Why?
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.040]   Well, because of the things that are happening.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.360]   And now it's not at all an unusual thing to read about the end of the world in a daily
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   newspaper.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.560]   Did you read the address, or the report of the address delivered the other day in America
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.960]   by Sir Charles Snow, known as the novelist C.P.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   Snow?
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   Did you read what he said about the next ten years?
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.520]   Now, this is not a Christian, this isn't a preacher talking about the end of the world.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:01.660]   This is a man, an eminent scientist, and he was addressing a body of scientists in America.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.920]   And what he said, you remember, was this, that he trembled to think of what might happen
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.200]   in the next ten years, when so many nations would have made these bombs and have them
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.440]   in their possession.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.880]   And then he said, "It'll take nothing but just some fool, some lunatic, suddenly to
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:26.600]   press the wrong button, or to set one of these things off, and that would mean the end."
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.120]   You see, it's a scientist who says a thing like that now.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.200]   Now it's our business to face facts, my friends.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:42.800]   You see, the whole world is beginning to think and to talk about the possibility of the end.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.080]   The very progress to which we pinned our faith is the thing that has brought us to see the
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.440]   possibility of the end of the world at any moment.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.560]   So there has been a complete change and transformation in the attitude and the approach towards this
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.440]   great subject.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:07.680]   But that makes it all the more necessary that we should approach it in the right way.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.520]   Very well, I needn't argue any longer as to the possibility of deals.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.680]   There is no longer the danger of being ridiculed out of court.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.760]   Your eminent scientists, who are not Christians at all, they are saying there's a real possibility
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.120]   that in ten years' time this world may be out of existence, it'll be blown up by man
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   himself.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.320]   Well, therefore, I say, all we've got to do is to make sure that we are approaching this
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.860]   in the right way, and that's why I'm calling your attention to this subject this evening.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.840]   There is a wrong way of approaching this.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   What is that?
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.040]   There are two main fallacies, it seems to me, in our approach to this very possibility.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.320]   Here is the first.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.540]   That we should simply spend the whole of our time in trying to prevent this from happening.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.160]   That is what Sir Charles Snow was concerned to do, and from his standpoint it's the obvious
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.240]   thing to do.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.320]   And that is what many others are trying to do.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:15.080]   That is what many in the name of Christ and of the Christian church are doing.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:21.600]   Did you hear or see a man a few months back giving an epilogue under the auspices of the
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   BBC on a Sunday night?
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.560]   And this is what he was saying.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.640]   He was talking about these bombs and the possibility of one of them going off, or a number of them
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.500]   going off, and the world being blown up, exactly as Sir Charles Snow had been saying.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.880]   What was his Christian message so-called?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.520]   Well, it was this.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:49.480]   He said, "If we don't succeed in persuading our own government especially to ban the bomb
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:55.640]   and to stop making these things, if we don't give this great moral example before the whole
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   world that will lead the others to do the same, well, then," he said, "we've got nothing
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.260]   to look forward to but the end."
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.260]   So what was his message?
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.260]   His message was this.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.440]   "Let's try to prevent this end from happening.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.940]   Let's besiege the government.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.180]   Let's petition our members of parliament.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.180]   Let's march.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.180]   Let's sign.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.580]   Let's do everything we can as Christian people to stop this thing that's going to put an
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.000]   end to the world."
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.020]   His whole object was to try to prevent the end of the world from materialising.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.000]   And there are many who think that that is Christianity, that the Christian church of
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.780]   all institutions is here in the world in order to try to prevent the coming of the end of
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:46.300]   the world through the folly of mankind, that we are to persuade men to stop this nonsense
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.940]   and to embrace one another and to live happily as brethren, a spirit of brotherhood, that
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.420]   that's our business as Christian preachers.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:15:00.920]   That is one of what I call the fallacies in this approach to this dreaded possibility
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.600]   of the end of the world.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.360]   There's a second fallacy, and the second fallacy is found exclusively in the Christian church
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.660]   and amongst Christian people.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.920]   It isn't that one.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.760]   The people belonging to the second group know perfectly well that that's quite wrong.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.160]   Well what is their fallacy?
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.240]   Well their fallacy is that they spent the whole of their time in trying to work out
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.200]   in detail as to when the end is going to take place.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   So they read their newspapers.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.400]   Now they say, "Where does this come in the Scriptures?"
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.080]   And so they spend the whole of their time working out a kind of jigsaw puzzle, trying
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.520]   to fix the exact time when it's coming, and they're convinced it's going to happen at
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.520]   such and such a date.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:46.200]   I read, you know, just two years ago a statement by one such good brother in which he said
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.240]   categorically and definitely that the Scriptures taught beyond any doubt whatsoever that the
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.600]   end must come before December 1959.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.420]   I'm quite sure that he's still teaching that sort of thing, but he's changed the date.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.200]   Of course this has happened for many centuries.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.920]   It's the thing that inevitably happens the moment you begin to pay attention to the times
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   and seasons.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.480]   The Scripture tells you not to do that.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.680]   And to fix this and to see that and the significance.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.560]   And so you see, you find men sometimes entering into a railway compartment, as happened to
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560]   me on one occasion.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.760]   A young man came into a train.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.440]   When my train stopped at Reading, a young man came in and sat opposite to me.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.660]   And I noticed that he held two things in one hand.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.400]   One was the times and the other was a Bible.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.960]   And I knew exactly what he was and what he was going to do.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.000]   He was going to give an address on the end of the world.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.400]   And of course he was going to show how the things that you can read in the times had
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.240]   already been said in the Scriptures.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.840]   Now that is not the way our Lord tells us to approach this.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.780]   We are not to be concerned, he tells us, about trying to fix the times and the seasons.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.880]   Many will come and say, "I am Christ and it's about to happen."
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   "Don't listen," he says, "don't listen."
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.840]   The Apostle Paul likewise tells us that we are not to be concerned about the times and
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.000]   seasons; that is a wrong and a false approach.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.960]   What then is the true and the right approach?
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.800]   Listen to what our Lord himself has got to say.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.640]   What are we to do tonight with our world as it is?
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.920]   The first thing we have to do is to listen to his teaching.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.300]   Not to speculate, but to listen to his teaching.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.520]   Never to get excited and frantic and feel that something that we may do or not do can
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.720]   decide whether the end of the world is to come or not.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   No, no.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.840]   It's to listen to his teaching and to observe very carefully what he tells us.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.120]   Why should we listen to his teaching, Sir somebody?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.680]   "Well, I can't help to answer that question.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.400]   The sufficient answer is that this is the Son of God."
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.800]   Well, how do you know that, Sir somebody?
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   Well, listen to this.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.960]   Listen to this sort of evidence.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.320]   Very soon after he uttered these words, he was crucified and he died, and he was buried
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.560]   in a grave, and a stone was put over it, and a seal was put on that, and soldiers were
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.440]   put there to guard it and to safeguard it against any possibility of anybody trying
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.640]   to remove the body.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:29.800]   The authorities themselves sought that, but in spite of that, he did leave that grave.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.320]   He came out of it.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.960]   Nobody saw it happening, nobody knows how it did happen, but he did.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   He came out and he appeared to certain chosen followers, the resurrection.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.400]   This person who prophesied, died, rose again.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.420]   He's the only one who's ever done that.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.400]   There would never have been a Christian church if that hadn't happened to him.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.080]   You remember the story about his disciples, don't you?
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:59.160]   Utterly crestfallen, absolutely defeated and pessimistic, feeling that everything had gone,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.120]   suddenly he appears to them, puts new life into them, fills them with his Spirit.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.640]   That's the beginning of the Christian church.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.800]   There never would have been a church if Christ, who had been crucified and buried, had not
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.760]   risen again from the dead.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.920]   That's a reason for listening to it.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.420]   But listen, I've got further reasons.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:22.440]   I've reminded you that a part of this prophecy of his was an immediate one.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:28.560]   He told them how very soon their city of Jerusalem was going to be surrounded by a Gentile army.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.240]   And that that Gentile army was going to conquer them in a very terrible way.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.040]   And as a result of that, he said, they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.380]   led away captive into all nations.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.560]   And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.480]   fulfilled.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.560]   For convenience, let's say that he was saying that in A.D. 33.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.280]   And what I'm reminding you of now is this, that in A.D. 70, that very thing that he said
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.520]   literally and actually happened.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.520]   Now this was a most astounding thing.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.280]   Some speak of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.440]   And it was a magnificent building, that temple.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.080]   The Jews were very proud of it and rightly proud of it.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.000]   There were some of the most massive stones in that temple that could be found anywhere
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.360]   in the whole world.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.720]   They had built, not for time, but as they thought, for eternity.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:31.280]   It was a massive and a solid building, immovable and unshakable.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:38.360]   Yet here is this man who appears to be nothing but a Jewish peasant and artisan, a mere carpenter.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.640]   He stands there and he says, "You know, as for these things which ye behold, the days
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.360]   will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   be thrown down."
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.760]   Of course, they did the usual thing.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.880]   They asked him, saying, "Master, but when shall these things be?"
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.560]   He didn't answer them.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   He spoke in symbols, in parables.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.120]   But the important thing is that he told them that it was going to happen.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.580]   And I am reminding you that in A.D. 70, it literally happened.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.200]   The Roman army surrounded Jerusalem.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   It sacked it.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   It destroyed it.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   It so destroyed that temple that literally there was not one stone standing upon another.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:29.560]   And moreover, the Jews were thrown out of Palestine amongst the nations of the world.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:35.000]   And throughout the running centuries, that is where they have been, until you remember
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.200]   what happened in 1917 and afterwards.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:44.840]   Now, if you've got no other reason for listening to this teacher, isn't that enough for you?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:52.440]   Two sections to his prophecy, the immediate, it's happened, the remote.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.400]   It hasn't happened yet, but aren't you ready to trust one who has been verified so absolutely
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.240]   about the immediate, when it appeared to be an utter impossibility?
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.920]   He said it would happen, it did happen.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.760]   But let me give you a further reason.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.400]   There is one, you see, who looks into the future and what does he prophesy, a steadily
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:22.520]   advancing world and civilization, men shaking off the chains and rising to his true dignity
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.580]   and the world becoming perfect?
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.580]   You remember, don't you?
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.580]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.160]   And I want to put it to you like this this evening.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.680]   If you had no other reason for believing the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, surely
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.560]   the state of your world tonight ought to make you do so.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.920]   It is he and he alone who has prophesied things like this.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:52.040]   The pagan philosophers and teachers, their great philosophers, they predicted an advancing
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   world.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.520]   All people who are not Christian have always done that.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.400]   The politicians, the statesmen, they have all talked about the advance and the development
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.440]   and the inevitability of it.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.680]   They've all said that and they've all believed it.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.920]   Here is the only one who has told us that the world is going to continue as a place
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:26.200]   of trouble, wars and rumors of wars, pestilences, earthquakes, fights, disagreements, troubles.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.920]   I ask you in the name of God, why don't you believe this teacher?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:37.440]   The world tonight is proving that he and he alone knows the truth.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.080]   All our optimists have been proved to be wrong.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.280]   The world tonight is demonstrating it.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.040]   The whole turmoil, the trouble, is a proof of his prophecy.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.920]   That's why we should listen to him.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.320]   Well, very well, what does he teach us?
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.600]   What he teaches us is this.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.560]   Let me summarize it.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.920]   He says that the coming of the end is absolutely certain.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:14.360]   As a snare it shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.400]   Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:29.240]   things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:38.840]   Now what our Lord taught was this, that this world of ours is on a definite time limit.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:45.480]   There is a definite time when this world is going to end.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.120]   And his teaching is, of course, that nothing can stop that.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.920]   If you read the parallel passage in Mark 13, you will find there that he says that of the
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.620]   day and of the hour, that he didn't know it as the Son of Man.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.280]   He said that the very angels in heaven don't know it.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.360]   He says there's only one who knows it, and that is the Father.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:10.640]   He has determined the time, the point.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:17.760]   God, who made the world, has also appointed a time and a date when this world is going
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.280]   to come to an end.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.360]   Our Lord not only says that, he says that nothing can stop that, that nothing can prevent
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   it.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.400]   "Why is this the case?" says somebody.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.640]   Well, there is no doubt about the answer.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   Our Lord teaches it.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.320]   The whole Bible teaches it.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.880]   All this is because man has fallen into sin.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:45.120]   If man had not fallen into sin, there would not be an end of the world.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.320]   It would have been a constant development and progress.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.080]   If man had only gone on obeying God and living according to God's way, he would have achieved
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.080]   immortality.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   Death would never have come in at all, and the ground would never have been cursed.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.000]   It would have just gone on and on and on, developing everlastingly in glory.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.520]   But that isn't what's happened.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:11.540]   Man sinned, man fell, evil has come in, the world has rebelled against God and turned
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:18.880]   its back upon God, and the end of the world, I say, is the result of man's sin and God's
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.320]   judgment upon the sin of man.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.000]   That's the teaching.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.120]   Now I want to put this as plainly and as simply as I can, because as our Lord was here speaking
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:38.180]   to his followers, there is in this a great message of hope.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.180]   Hope you say?
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.180]   Yes, listen.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:45.340]   There is, I say, the only hope, the greatest hope of all.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.920]   But let's be clear about the nature of the hope.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:58.360]   There is no hope for the world in and of itself, and as it is, the world is a doomed world.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.640]   There is no improvement possible for this world, because it is a sinful world, because
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.760]   it is an evil world.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.320]   Hasn't this been the whole course of human history?
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.560]   Now, I'm asking you now just to consider your secular history books.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.240]   Isn't this it?
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.920]   There have been times in the history of mankind when you've had a kind of flowering period.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.960]   Great poets, great dramatists, great scientists, great explorers, like the Elizabethan period
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.360]   or something like that, and everybody said, "No, they're not lost.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   We're really beginning.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.060]   We're about to set forward."
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.920]   There have been periods like that in the past.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.800]   There have been great civilizations in China, in Egypt, in Babylon, and in various other
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.000]   parts of the world, and man seemed to be rising up, and there seemed to be no end to the possibility
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.120]   of development.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.400]   But you know, the story is that it didn't continue like that.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:02.700]   That was followed by a period of stagnation, and then by a period of decline.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:09.880]   It's all summed up in the title of Gibbon's famous book, isn't it, The Rise and Fall of
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.480]   the Roman Empire.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.800]   And of course, similar things have happened in this country.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.960]   If you read the history of this country, you'll find this curious periodicity.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.600]   These great flowering periods are followed by periods of decline.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.040]   There was that great Elizabethan era, followed by the Puritan era, but then followed by Charles
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.120]   II and the Restoration, and all that followed in the wake of that.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.440]   Then another great revival, and so on.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.720]   Now, this is the principle.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:46.320]   All these periods of advance and of development, of improvement, have all followed some kind
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   of a religious movement.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.480]   People don't realize that, of course.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.320]   They think it's they themselves.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.300]   But if you look into it, you'll find that they've always followed great reformation.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.400]   The reformation was followed by the Elizabethan period.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.380]   The great advance in the time of Cromwell was directly the result of Puritan teaching.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.100]   And then, you see, the great evangelical awakening of the 18th century led to the great Victorian
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   era.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.600]   Ah, but people forgot the origin.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.960]   They said, "We're doing this, and we don't need religion.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.920]   We can carry on without God."
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.480]   And you and I are experiencing the result of that.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:26.200]   We are going down, and down, and down, because we missed the cause of the improvement.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.120]   Well, now, the Bible has told us all this from the very beginning.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:35.680]   It says that all these periods of improvement are only temporary, that the world tends to
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.080]   remain the same.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:45.280]   It's up and down, but the great characteristic will always be this trouble.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.000]   Man is always talking about his utopia, but he never gets there.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.120]   There have been great efforts to make a great peace.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.640]   There was a Pax Romana, remember?
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.560]   And people thought that there'd never be another war.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.520]   Rome had conquered the whole world.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.280]   Who could fight against her?
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.520]   And yet she went down.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.520]   Why?
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   From internal rot.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.640]   They were so secure, they spent their time in their baths and in their feasts, and down
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.680]   went their great empire.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.280]   It's happened to all the others.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.000]   No, no, there is no hope for the world.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.120]   The world is to be ever a place of wars and rumors of wars, pestilences, troubles, earthquakes,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   and all the rest of it.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.120]   That's to characterize, he says, the whole of human history.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:35.320]   But then he goes on to say that the end is to come.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.560]   And how will the end come?
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:42.440]   Well, the end will come, he says, when he himself returns into this world.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.880]   He said you shall see the sun of men and the clouds of heaven surrounded by the holy angels.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.200]   This is his teaching.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.640]   He says, I am going to come back into this world to judge the world.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.800]   And he says it's going to be a universal judgment.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:09.120]   It shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.240]   Does it sound mad to you?
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.880]   Well, you know the prophecy of his first coming as the babe of Bethlehem sounded utterly ridiculous
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.180]   to large numbers of people.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.280]   But it came, it happened.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.560]   What he said about the destruction of Jerusalem seemed utterly monstrous to these people.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   They drove him out.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.160]   They couldn't stand such nonsense.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.040]   But it happened in A.D. 70.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.120]   And here he is saying that he's going to come back into this world.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.400]   Oh, my dear friend, don't dismiss him.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.120]   He said he was going to rise from the dead, and he did.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.360]   Nobody believed him, not even his own apostles.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.560]   Even they didn't get it.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.920]   But he rose.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.120]   And here he is saying that he's going to come back, riding the clouds of heaven surrounded
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.520]   by his holy angels.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.040]   And he's going to judge the whole world in righteousness, everybody.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.400]   Nobody will be left out.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.720]   Only one of you in this building, I with you, everybody who's ever lived, everybody who's
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   ever going to live.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.840]   The whole world shall stand before him.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.440]   Every human being that has ever breathed, it shall come on all them that dwell on the
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.400]   face of the whole earth.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.360]   They'll rise from the graves, they'll come up out of the sea, wherever they are.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:22.600]   The whole of humanity will stand before him, and he will judge.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.840]   What does it mean, says somebody?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.160]   Well, it means this.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:35.280]   Evil and all who belong to the power of evil shall be finally condemned and sent to everlasting
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.680]   destruction.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.640]   The devil and his angels and all his powers and all who believed him and wandered after
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:52.280]   him, all people who died out of this life in sin, going their own way, following the
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:58.720]   way of the world, not believing in God, not believing in Christ, all such shall hear the
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   sentence of condemnation, banishment from the presence of God, eternal punishment.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.360]   That's what he says.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.440]   I'm not saying this.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.080]   If you don't like it, you're not quarreling with me.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.840]   You are quarreling with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.880]   How could I or any man imagine something like this?
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.040]   How could any man invent something like this?
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.560]   It's too terrible to think of.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:30.000]   It is he who says it, the Son of God, the one who rose up from the dead.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.640]   But, thank God, there's another side to this, all who, having realized their sinfulness
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:48.360]   and their folly, have believed in him, shall be told of their glorious reward, shall be
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:56.280]   ushered into glory, and shall begin to live that eternity of glory and light and joy and
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.080]   delight in the presence of God.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   That's what he's going to do.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.580]   He'll come back and he'll divide the whole of humanity into two groups, the right and
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:16.200]   the left, the sheep and the goats, the believers and the unbelievers, the saints and those
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.680]   who despised him and rejected him.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:25.880]   Now then, the first thing he asks us to do is to believe his teaching, to believe that
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:32.440]   whatever mankind may do, the end has got to come.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.760]   Even if the nations of the world decide to have a disarmament conference, now that we've
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   got a new president in the United States, let's assume now then that they all come
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.680]   together and that they embrace one another and they say, "We're going to spoil all
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.280]   these bombs, we'll take out these fuses, not one of them will ever be used, we'll
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.240]   never make another atomic bomb, we'll sign a pact never to fight again."
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.320]   Let them do all that.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:07.000]   They won't do it to start with, but even if they did, the end of the world will still
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.520]   come.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.240]   It must come.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.000]   It is God's judgment, it is God's own appointment, it is God's own determination.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.680]   And whatever man does, it must come, it shall come, says this blessed person.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.560]   And do what you will, you can never stop it.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.920]   So to spend your time in trying to stop it is to be fighting against inevitability.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.840]   It's like the foolish waves trying to knock down a mountain, it can't be done, they're
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.400]   only thrown back in their own helplessness.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.280]   It shall come, and every one of us will be involved in it, that's what he says.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.720]   Well, therefore he says this in the second place, "The one thing for us to do is not
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:53.640]   to try to discover when this is going to happen, but to prepare ourselves for it.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:10.540]   and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares as a snare.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:15.180]   Be ready always.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.480]   Beware lest this come upon you as a trap comes upon a bird.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.640]   Have you seen the snare set for the bird?
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.840]   The little bird doesn't know it.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:31.300]   It sees a tasty morsel, and it's so concerned about this it doesn't see what's there around
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:38.340]   this tasty morsel, and in it goes, suddenly the trap snaps, it's caught, snare, the snare
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:46.140]   of the fowler, like a little mouse caught in a rat trap, or in a mouse trap.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.740]   The sudden catching, snaring, it's too late, it's all over, "Oh, don't let that happen
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.780]   to you," says Christ.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.820]   How do you avoid that?
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:03.320]   Well, he tells us, "The one thing for us to do is to learn how to stand before the Son
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   of Man.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:11.500]   Watch ye therefore, and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:20.620]   things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man."
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.260]   That's the only thing that matters this evening?
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.300]   Do what we will, we cannot prevent, we cannot stop the end of the world, we can't evade
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   it.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   What matters?
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.700]   Oh, here's the only thing that matters, that you be able to stand before the Son of Man,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.780]   this Man, this Son of Man who's coming on the clouds with the angels to judge, and the
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.580]   whole world will be before him.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.420]   And the question is, can you stand before him, or will you be swept away by the judgment
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:58.860]   and by the wrath, to stand before the Son of Man?
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.940]   My dear friend, that's the only thing that should engage your attention, nothing else
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.940]   at all.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.180]   It doesn't matter how the end of the world is going to come.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.380]   It may come very well through the explosion of a hydrogen bomb.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.100]   It may be God's way of bringing it to pass, I don't know, but I don't care how it comes.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.260]   What I know is that I've got to face this Son of God.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:28.500]   And the question is, can I stand before him, or will I be swept away in the judgment?
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.700]   How can anybody stand before him?
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.020]   Oh, thank God there is no uncertainty about that.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.340]   I can tell you, my dear friend, you've only one thing to do, and that is to believe on
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.340]   him.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.900]   Believe that he is, as he says, the Son of God, the Savior of the world.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.300]   Believe his teaching.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.740]   Believe that he has come into the world because the world has sinned against God, and that
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.580]   all who have sinned against God, if they remain like that, are going to be punished everlastingly
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.540]   out of the presence of God.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.140]   But that he has come into this world to save us from that.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.300]   He didn't come to improve the world, he tells us about the doom of the world.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:14.060]   What he has done is to come to save us out of this doom.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:20.220]   And what he says is this, he says, "If you believe that I am he, if you believe that
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:27.260]   I am the Son of God, and that I came into this world in order to take your sin from
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:32.980]   you, take your guilt upon myself, to take your punishment, if you only believe that
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:40.020]   I've come to die, that you might be rescued and redeemed, ransomed and forgiven and reconciled
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.020]   to God."
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.340]   He says, "If you believe that, and give yourself and your life to me, put yourself
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.440]   into my safekeeping, then," he says, "you've got nothing to fear.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.140]   When I come, you'll be able to stand before me.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.540]   I'll recognize you.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:59.540]   I'll say to you, 'Come, ye blessed of the Lord, enter in the kingdom prepared for
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.540]   you.'"
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:10.480]   That's all we have to do, because if we haven't believed in him, when he comes he
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.900]   will look at us and we will say to him perhaps, "Oh, Lord, Lord, we see that you are a
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.260]   great Lord and a judge."
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.060]   He says, "I will look unto you and say, 'I never knew you, depart from me you that
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.060]   work iniquity.'"
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:30.460]   They don't stand, they're swept away.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:38.540]   The only way to stand before the Son of Man in the judgment is to belong to him, to believe
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:46.100]   in him, to give yourself and your life to him, to believe his own word.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.000]   He said, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Listen to him.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.380]   "The Son of Man," he says, "has not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.940]   to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   Listen to him.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:07.180]   "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:13.180]   Here he says, "Terrible things are going to happen, but don't be afraid.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.180]   Come unto me, you needn't be afraid."
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.740]   Why, he says, "If you only believe on me, far from being afraid, this is what will happen
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.740]   to you."
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:26.540]   "Then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:32.060]   And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.380]   redemption draweth nigh."
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.540]   He says, "You Christian people, you're having a hard time in this world.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.100]   They're laughing at you, they're blaspheming you, they're persecuting you.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.300]   Your father or mother may do it, and everybody's against you, and you're having a hell of
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.900]   a time in this world.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.260]   But it's all right," he says, "when you see these things beginning to happen, lift
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:57.340]   up your heads, your redemption draweth nigh.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.500]   The day is coming when I'm going to receive you unto myself, and I'm going to take you
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.340]   into the glory which you're going to share with me throughout the countless ages of eternity.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.540]   Believe on him, and when he comes, you'll be able to stand, and you'll rejoice in his
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.740]   glorious presence."
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.100]   That's the first thing.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:24.860]   But it isn't the only thing, "Oh, yes, we must believe in him, but we must also watch,
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:31.340]   take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:43.260]   and drunkenness and cares of this life, and so that they come upon you unawares as a snare.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:51.100]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and cling to him."
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.820]   This world will try to draw your attention away.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.060]   It's doing so at the present time, isn't it?
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:03.300]   Interest in the bonds rather than in God and in Christ, interest in political action rather
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:10.700]   than in your own soul, interest in pleasure and in amusement, surfeiting, drunkenness.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.860]   That's what the world's interested in tonight, isn't it?
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:19.340]   In spite of the world being as it is tonight, in spite of the fact that little children
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:26.420]   are starving in that Congo—have you seen them on the television?—in spite of the
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:32.780]   terrible possibilities in many countries in Africa, in spite of that explosive position
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:39.080]   in the Far East, in spite of what may very well happen as a result of Cuba, in spite
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.860]   of what the world is tonight, what are men and women doing?
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:49.580]   Surfeiting and drunkenness, eating too much, drinking too much, indulging their lusts and
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.900]   their passions too much.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.100]   Beware of that Cesar, Lord.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.980]   And you notice he adds the cares of this world, the cares of this life.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:08.100]   It isn't only drunkenness and surfeiting.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.460]   Your own business may be occupying so much of your time that you forget your soul, and
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.900]   you forget you've got to stand before the Son of Man.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:22.220]   You may be a housewife, and you may be so busy in feeding your husband and your children
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.340]   and donning their socks that you forget your soul, and that you've got to stand before
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.340]   the Son of Man.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:36.660]   The cares of this world, it isn't only drunkenness, it isn't only surfeiting.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:42.660]   We can be so absorbed by newspapers and pleasures and interests and cares, some of them perfectly
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:51.180]   legitimate, that when the Son of Man comes, we'll be taken unawares, and disappearing
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:55.740]   will be like the snare that catches the bird, the snare of the fowler.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:05.540]   O Cesar, Lord, take heed yourselves, watch, watch ye therefore and pray always.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.100]   Recognize that this is a doomed and a dangerous and a devilish world, and it's doing its
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.780]   utmost to stand between you and your soul's salvation and your eternity in the presence
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.980]   of God and the glory that awaits his children.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.740]   Watch, take heed.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.500]   The end is bound to come.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.740]   The end shall come.
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.740]   It will come.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.740]   I don't know when.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.700]   Sir Charles Snow says it may be before 1970.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:43.300]   I don't know, but all I do know is that it is coming.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.380]   Is Christ to reign a little over a thousand years?
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.820]   You know, it really doesn't matter.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.220]   He may or he may not.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.420]   That's not what matters.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:56.620]   What matters is that you and I have got to stand before him.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:03.620]   And we either hear the words, "Depart from me that work iniquity, I never knew you,"
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:13.020]   or else the smile of recognition, "Come, ye blessed of the Lord, enter ye into the
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:21.780]   joy of the Lord, enter into the kingdom that is prepared for you."
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.340]   Isn't it difficult to realize these things?
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.860]   Isn't it difficult to realize that the world is going to come to an end?
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.780]   Now, I say it shouldn't be very difficult tonight, should it?
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.980]   You know, it's much easier to preach now than it would have been forty years ago.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.260]   Indeed, let me say this.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:40.020]   I find it much easier to preach now than I did when I began to preach thirty-four years
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.020]   ago.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.820]   Why, well, the world is proving it.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.900]   Sir Charles Snow is saying it.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.140]   But watch, take heed.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.740]   Don't let it fritter away from your mind tonight.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.740]   Be careful as you go out of this very chapel and what you talk about afterwards.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.540]   The devil will steal the word.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:07.300]   Christ says, "You take it away from you, hold on to it, watch, take heed.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.980]   This is going to happen to you, it's going to happen to me.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.020]   You can't evade it, you can't avoid it.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:20.540]   It is coming and on the whole earth and all men."
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:26.920]   Make sure that you know how to stand before the Son of Man.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:33.260]   Believe in Him, follow Him, and live in such a way that when He does come, it won't be
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:40.700]   a terror to you, it'll be a joy, for you'll see Him as He is.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.300]   You'll see the Son of God in His glory.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.540]   You'll look into His eyes, you'll look into His face, you'll realize something of the
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.980]   love that wherewith He has loved you that made Him even die on the cross for your sins.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:59.220]   You know it's the most glorious thing that can ever happen, to see Him and to be made
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:05.260]   like Him, to be changed into His image, to be glorified and to spend eternity in His
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.300]   presence.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:14.540]   Why do we hold on to this sinful, evil world as we do, with its wars and commotions and
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   pestilences and famines and cruelty and unhappiness and evil and sin and drunkenness and surfeity?
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:26.800]   Why do we hold on to it so tenaciously and regard the end as some awful calamity?
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.260]   It shouldn't be to those who believe in Him.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.380]   We should look forward to it.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.420]   We should hasten its coming.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:41.820]   We should dwell with ravishment of heart upon its fulfillment.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:53.340]   Oh, the joy of seeing my Lord as He is, and being like Him.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.620]   Believe on Him, my dear friends.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:02.560]   Pray to Him, watch, take heed, don't let the world come between you and Him.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:11.380]   Keep it all back, push it away, take heed unto yourselves, lest at any time your hearts
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:17.540]   be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:24.100]   And so this day come upon you unawares, watch ye therefore, and pray always that ye may
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:34.140]   be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.500]   the Son of Man.
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:43.260]   Keep your eye on Him, let nothing obtrude itself between you and Him, go on doing that.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:55.740]   And the day of His coming will be the most glorious day that you've ever known or experienced.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.060]   Amen.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.980]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
