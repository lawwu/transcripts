[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.720]   and I do that so that I can rejigger all the categories
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   and I do that so that I can rejigger all the categories
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   and I do that so that I can rejigger all the categories

[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.620]   and I do that so that I can rejigger all the categories because I don't think of categories
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:32.640]   because I don't think of categories
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.960]   because I don't think of categories just as artificial.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:33.980]   just as artificial.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.620]   just as artificial. So I don't want the standard categories
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:35.640]   So I don't want the standard categories
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.320]   So I don't want the standard categories and again, I don't recommend this
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.420]   and again, I don't recommend this
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.480]   and again, I don't recommend this for necessarily new,
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:38.520]   for necessarily new,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.480]   for necessarily new, you know, personal finance novices.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.500]   you know, personal finance novices.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:58.640]  , you know, personal finance novices. I don't want just the standard categories.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:58.680]   I don't want just the standard categories.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.540]   I don't want just the standard categories. I want categories that actually help me.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:10:59.600]   I want categories that actually help me.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   I want categories that actually help me. So every couple of years, I delete the budget.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.640]   So every couple of years, I delete the budget.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:03.720]   So every couple of years, I delete the budget. I start completely fresh with totally new data.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   I start completely fresh with totally new data. And I use that as an opportunity to totally redo my categories.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:03.760]   And I use that as an opportunity to totally redo my categories.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:14.940]   So everything is categorized according to the Schedule C categories.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.000]   So everything is categorized according to the Schedule C categories.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.860]   So everything is categorized according to the Schedule C categories. So that at the end of the year, if I have a bit budgeted YNAB that corresponds to a business, boom, it's just all it's all lined up and all previously categorized with a Schedule C. On the personal side, I look at it and say, what are my goals and my spending goals? And as I said, I categorize it based upon what I'm actually trying to accomplish. And so those are my answers. Andy, how do you use YNAB?
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:23.880]   And so those are my answers. Andy, how do you use YNAB?
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.020]   And so those are my answers. Andy, how do you use YNAB?
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.080]   And so those are my answers. Andy, how do you use YNAB?
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:50.240]  , I think I am using the online version with auto import. But I think I kind of use it similarly to what you do, because I've found I've not had to use it to dig out from under anything. I've been over the 30 days of money since about the 31st day that I was using it.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.320]   I think I'm using the online version with auto import. But I think I kind of use it similarly to what you do, because I've found I've not had to use it to dig out from under anything. I've been over the 30 days of money since about the 31st day that I was using it.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   I think I'm using the online version with auto import. But I think I kind of use it similarly to look at the schedule and then I'm actually trying to do some of the schedule.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:12:12.840]   And so I end up kind of like you said, generally allocating at the beginning of the month. But then there's a lot of, well, I have this, you know, immediate budget and I have a education budget and I put my 20 bucks in both, but then I spent 40 in one and nothing in the other for this month. So I just move that money around.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:12.880]   And so I end up kind of like you said, generally allocating at the beginning of the month.

So I just move that money around.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.520]   So I guess it seems to me like I use it more as a tracking tool and don't really do.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   So I guess it seems to me like I use it more as a tracking tool and don't really do.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:47.720]  , and don't really do much budgeting.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   And it sounds like you do kind of the same and you actually do your budgeting by just giving yourself cash to spend.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   So a number of years ago I recorded an episode of the show where I talked about philosophies of budgeting.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   I'm convinced of this.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   I'm convinced of this.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   There doesn't, you don't need to use the same budgeting approach at all stages of your financial life.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.520]   So if somebody is just getting started with money and they're not getting the money,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.320]   they are, yeah, and they're totally broke,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.160]   I think tracking every single dollar helps.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.480]   And doing it to the penny is really, really valuable
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.640]   because you're building a skill.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.280]   Most people who get in trouble with money usually get there
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.360]   because they're not paying attention to money.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.120]   So by practicing the skill of very focused budgeting,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.160]   then they're working their way in building something
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.000]   that they need to build.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.040]   So once you've built that basic skill, however,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.080]   then I think you can grow on.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.520]   And that's where,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   I think you can grow on.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   And that's where,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   I think you can grow on.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   And that's where,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   I think you can grow on.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   And that's where, I think you can grow on.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   And that's where you can build that basic skill, however,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:48.520]   And that's where, I think you can grow on.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   And that's where, I think you can grow on.

[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.320]   join the is
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.800]   Guard. Is there any other tool that does that that's not cloud based?
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:45.180]   The problem is, so I'm not aware of any, there is tiller, which is built on Google Sheets. But then again, you have all your data in Google, and it's cloud based. But that was what they kind of, they built their business on tiller. And I think it's a great solution. For people who don't mind their data being there. I think it's a great solution, because it accomplishes the auto
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   I think it's a great solution, because it accomplishes the auto
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   I think it's a great solution, because it accomplishes the auto
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   I think it's a great solution, because it accomplishes the auto
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   I think it's a great solution, because it accomplishes the auto import function, but it gives you just the auto import function, but it gives you just the auto import function, but it gives you just the ability to do a lot of things.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:17:15.200]  , but it gives you just the ability to do a lot of things. For me, I, the data entry is certainly a data entry is certainly an impediment for a lot of people. I guess for me, I don't have that I try to minimize the number of transactions. And it's just not that big of a deal to me to spend, it probably takes me 15 minutes a week. And I enjoy it, I put on a
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:15.300]   I enjoy it, I put on a
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:45.220]   I enjoy it, I put on a podcast or listen to something, sit down at my computer, pull all the receipts out of my wallet. I keep a three by five card in my wallet. And then so if I don't get a receipt, I just write down the the amount of money that I spend. Because if I'm spending something, all of my everything is just automatically done. But if I'm spending something, I always spend cash. And just takes a little bit of time. But beyond that, I don't have an answer. I think probably if YNAB were to cancel and not allow me to use their legacy version of the software, because I don't want to be on the cloud, I would go back to my spreadsheet solution.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:45.220]   I think probably if YNAB were to cancel and not allow me to use their legacy version of the software, because I don't want to be on the cloud, I would go back to my spreadsheet solution.

[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:46.000]   support Dave G,,,,
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:57.900]   Mr
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.820]   more expensive than a number 10 can.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.380]   It makes a lot of sense to have some MREs, meals ready to eat.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.380]   They're not that expensive.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.060]   And one of the things I like about meals ready to eat is that they're not very healthy,
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.980]   but they are really calorie rich.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:04.380]   But many times having MREs in the car will allow you to avoid having to make a stop at
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.820]   restaurant food, et cetera.
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.740]   And so just it's a useful thing because they're packed and they're ready to go at all times.
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.220]   And they taste good.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:10.220]   And so you can get a couple of these.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:40.220]   And then when you start to get to the bulk storage and you think about how do I get my family through a year or multiple years? And more importantly, how do I get my extended family through? Because I've got this big extended family or my neighbors. That's when you really get to the bulk storage options. How do I have buckets and buckets of food and wheat and corn and then you can kind of level up to there. But I've given you a lot of words.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:13:10.220]  , and I don't know that I've given you an exact answer.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:10.220]   It is certainly a it is certainly true that maybe you have to go five years. Maybe there's World War three and for years you can't even that I can't even believe that but maybe there's a global flu pandemic and you got to stay quarantined for a year or two years.
