[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.360]   welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.040]   Hi Joshua, thanks for taking my call. I wanted to ask you about budgeting and how you're using YNAB.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.160]   I've heard you mention having like, what seems to me like would be a lot of categories in YNAB,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.080]   and I was I guess curious if you budget a little bit of money in every category,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.400]   if what you do with it you'd consider true budgeting or more expense tracking, or
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.560]   how you're using that. I feel like I'm just tracking with it, and just curious.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yeah, it's a good question. So my relationship with YNAB is, I use it, I still use it. I've
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.400]   been using it for a few years. I am using the previous version of YNAB. It's one of the reasons
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.160]   why I still recommend them. I think their online stuff is great. But for me, I don't care to have
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.320]   my personal data stored on somebody else's servers. And so when they went to their software
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.760]   as a service model, which is I think a good business move for them, and for the vast majority
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.680]   of people, I think the right move, or as far as the right direction for people to go, but
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   meaning companies to go, then, but I stopped using their, I don't use the newest version,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.280]   that's all I'm saying. I use the previous version, which is stored on my desktop. That way,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.560]   I can do a little bit better job of keeping track of my financial data. Basically, I've come to the
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.000]   conclusion that if you store data online, you can expect in the fullness of time that all data that
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.480]   you give anybody online is going to be hacked. And so that's one of the reasons why I've stopped
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.640]   putting any of my data into any kind of central repository. I no longer use, I don't use personal
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.280]   capital, I don't use Mint, I don't use any of the online YNAB service or any other services,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.600]   because now I'm exposing my data to the potential of having all of my data breached, which I would
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.360]   prefer not to do. Now, the chances of that are, I don't know, I think they're high, but I know that
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.520]   YNAB and all the other providers do a good job of trying to seek to secure the data. But basically,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.760]   it seems to me that you'd have to be crazy to think that data can be secured. When you've got
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.520]   the US government, when you have the US government that loses all the data, the top secret data of
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.480]   everyone in the Department of Defense, and when you've got Experian and Equifax losing all their
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.320]   data, and it just seems to me foolish at this point to store data online if it doesn't need to
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.440]   be. So that's one interesting different thing about how I use YNAB. I use the previous version
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.520]   of the software that I originally paid for when you could buy the actual software, and I have no
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.200]   problem with it. Another weird thing I do is I don't actually use the automatic functionality
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.000]   of downloading transactions. So I'm weird again, and I spend more time than a lot of people. I
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.360]   think that for the majority of people, I think the automatic importing, the automatic categorization
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.000]   is probably the right move. But I like to take a little bit of time with my data, and I like to
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.240]   make sure that I'm really paying attention to it, and that I'm really conscious of what's happening.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.040]   And so I manually enter all the transactions in. I manually categorize them, and I try to think
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.120]   about the transactions when I'm putting them in. So that's another weird thing that I do that is
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:55.040]   probably not the common thing. So I put all my transactions into YNAB. I keep two different
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   YNAB budgets. I keep one budget for my business, and I keep one budget for my personal life,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.360]   and I keep those separate. YNAB is certainly not as powerful as proper business budgeting software,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.920]   and I think that most people who are running an actual business should go ahead and use QuickBooks.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.240]   I use or another accounting double entry, you know, just good accounting software as well,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   which I do use that some as well. But I've found that YNAB is just so simple, and I try to keep my
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.800]   affairs fairly simple, and so it works out well for that. In terms of budgeting, I do have some
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.640]   weird accounts. I've covered that in past shows, and I try to think about budgeting not in a kind
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:49.520]   of a strict sense, but more as trying to understand how my, you know, whether I should maximize a
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.560]   transaction or minimize a transaction. So that's why I use some of the weird categories that I use,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.880]   and I try to use transactions that are going to help me with the data that I need. So back to,
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.720]   you know, the bane of my existence has always been my family's food budget,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.240]   and if I just have a budget, that's the biggest, single biggest discretionary expense in our
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.160]   in our budget that's not preset. And so in trying to improve that, there's a real balance here,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.880]   because do I want to spend money on food, or do I want to spend money on, you know,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.920]   medical care in the future? It seems like I've heard people say in the past, I can't cite it,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.680]   I went looking for data to try to find it. But I heard people say that, you know, in the past,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.440]   people spent significant, let's just make up some numbers, 30% of their budget on food and 5% of
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.000]   their budget on healthcare expenses. But today, we spent 30% of our budgets on healthcare expenses,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.760]   and 5% on food. And so basically, you pick it, do you want to spend your money on food? Or do you
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.800]   want to spend your money at on healthcare? Now, I could never go through and find the actual data
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.400]   sources to verify that. But I thought, you know what, probably directionally, that's probably
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.840]   true. And so it doesn't make sense for me to try to be super frugal when it comes to food. But I
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.720]   also recognize that this is a big category. So for the last couple of years, I've actually tracked
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.040]   all of our food expenses by category. And I tried to see because I've always had this impression
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.800]   that what we do, we pretty well, we're pretty carefully. But I broke it down and I keep it in,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.720]   you know, I have a subcategory of groceries, meat, grains, I'd separate grains from bread.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.800]   So meat, grains, bread, fruits and vegetables, non-categorized expenses, sweets, etc. So that
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.280]   gives me an idea of how much of our budget is actually going to different categories. Again,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.800]   that's a weird thing that I think majority of people don't do. But the way I look at it is,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.560]   I need the data to get an understanding of what's actually happening. The first,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.880]   if you're going to make a good decision, the first thing you need is good data. And so I want my data,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.400]   not just the average person's data, so that I can have a sense of how much of our money is going to
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:08:00.240]   things that are really good versus things that are junk. And then that helps me if I'm shopping
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.880]   at Costco, and it helps me to pull out food from other expenses, etc. and have a good sense of
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.520]   that. So I keep detailed categories on the things that I care about. And then I segment the budget
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:21.760]   based upon whether it's a category that I want to spend a lot of money on, whether it's a category
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.800]   that I want to spend just what's necessary, or whether it's a category that I want to minimize.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.520]   And I try to keep my in my budget listings categories, I order them in that order.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.920]   So when I'm looking at the numbers of expenses for things that I want to spend a lot on,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.880]   all right, I've got it. When I'm looking at things that I'm going to set aside a
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.040]   pre established percentage, I have that in the middle. And then down below, I have that
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.960]   the other ones. With regard to budgeting, I do some budgeting. YNAB is brilliant because it makes
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:57.920]   it so doable to budget the money that's in your checking account. But given my geographic
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.160]   instability over the past couple of years, it's very hard for me to make the numbers work
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.560]   in advance. So what I do is I just simply spend cash and my budget is basically here's how much
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.080]   spending money I have. And I've allocated this to spending money, I put the money in my wallet.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.880]   And then I look to see how much money is in the wallet. And when the money's gone,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.320]   well, I go on to something else. So that's been a helpful way of just managing my spending.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.680]   And I only have a handful of spending categories, which are largely things like food,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:36.160]   that are not predetermined. So what I do is at the beginning of the month, I go ahead and fill
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.000]   in the budget categories with round numbers. And then I kind of skip out on all the little stuff,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.680]   all those little discretionary ones. I take X amount of dollars out of the ATM,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.520]   and I just spend cash. And that's how I keep myself on track. So I guess that's largely,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.680]   to answer your question, that's probably the best I got. Those are some weird things that I do.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.720]   I don't think I recommend those for most people. I think they work for me. I do it,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.040]   but I don't really recommend it for most people. I guess one other weird thing I do that most
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.520]   people might not think of is I change every, it's been about every year or two, I make a new budget.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.440]   And I do that so that I can rejigger all the categories. Because I don't think of categories
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.240]   just as artificial. So I don't want the standard categories. And again, I don't recommend this for
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.800]   necessarily new personal finance novices. But I don't want just the standard categories. I want
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.880]   categories that actually help me. So every couple of years, I delete the budget. I start completely
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.240]   fresh with totally new data. And I use that as an opportunity to totally redo my categories.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.560]   So on the business side, that's useful because all of my categories that I've used in YNAB
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   all fit, line up exactly with Schedule C. So everything is categorized according to the
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.080]   Schedule C categories so that at the end of the year, if I have a budget in YNAB that corresponds
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.880]   to a business, boom, it's all lined up and all previously categorized with a Schedule C.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.960]   On the personal side, I look at it and say, what are my goals and my spending goals? And as I said,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.600]   I categorize it based upon what I'm actually trying to accomplish. And so those are my answers.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:19.520]   Andy, how do you use YNAB? I think I am using the online version with auto import.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   I think I kind of use it similar way to what you do because I've found I've not had to use it to
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:34.400]   dig out from under anything. I've been over the 30 days of money. It's about the 31st day that I was
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   using it. And so I end up, kind of like you said, generally allocating at the beginning of the month.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.120]   But then there's a lot of, well, I have this immediate budget and I have an education budget
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   and I put my 20 bucks in both, but then I spent 40 in one and nothing in the other for this month.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.760]   So I just move that money around. I guess it seems to me like I use it more as a
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.960]   tracking tool and don't really do much budgeting. And it sounds like you do kind of the same and
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.640]   you actually do your budgeting by just giving yourself cash to spend.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:19.120]   So a number of years ago, I recorded an episode of the show where I talked about philosophies of
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:28.080]   budgeting. I'm convinced of this. You don't need to use the same budgeting approach at all stages
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.680]   of your financial life. So if somebody is just getting started with money and they're totally
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.520]   broke, I think tracking every single dollar helps. And doing it to the penny is really,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.600]   really valuable because you're building a skill. Most people who get in trouble with money usually
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.520]   get there because they're not paying attention to money. So by practicing the skill of very
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.640]   focused budgeting, then they're working their way in building something that they need to build.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.600]   So once you've built that basic skill, however, then I think you can grow on. And that's where
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.160]   for you doing some tracking, I don't see any reason why. If your budget is comfortable,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.760]   if you have a general sense of what you're spending, you could within an hour reproduce
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.400]   basically pretty close data on what you're spending. I don't see why you need to spend
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:26.320]   hours and hours doing all of the intricate planning. And if you have enough money and
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.880]   if you're automatically paying yourself first and have automated savings and investing happening up
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:39.680]   front, I don't see why you should have to take the time and put it into all of that tracking.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.720]   Unless you enjoy it. Like for me, it's my hobby. I enjoy it. I think it's fun. It gives me fodder
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:52.640]   for my show. I enjoy trying different things. For me, it is fun to do wacky financial things and to
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:59.040]   see what I can do here and how I can change there. And so it's my hobby. And I acknowledge that,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.680]   but I would never try to get somebody else to do what I do because for me, this is my hobby.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.880]   But then as you grow, so you have the beginner stage where you really got to budget every dollar,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.360]   then you grow to a stage where automated tracking is fine, even if you didn't use the budgeting
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.000]   feature, but you just have a generally right categorization of your money. And then I think
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.160]   from there, you can very quickly move on to kind of a wealthy person's budget where once a year,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.320]   you sit down and basically estimate what your expenses are. And if your household income is
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.280]   high and your expenses are low, it doesn't matter all that much in any given month,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.360]   how things work out with a couple hundred dollars here and a couple hundred dollars there.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.840]   So in my opinion, it's a matter of understanding where things need to be. And I would analogize
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:54.000]   it to say, like somebody who is trying to be an athlete, you know, you start off and somebody's
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.200]   fat and out of shape. Well, they need to do a lot of tracking because they don't know,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.680]   they don't know their macros, right? So you do a lot of tracking, then somebody can build a habit,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.920]   and then they don't need to track things quite so much, but they still generally need to be aware
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.160]   of what's going on. And then once somebody has reached their athletic goals, unless they're
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.560]   aiming for world class performance, there's no need for them to be tracking every little thing
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.200]   at every stage. So that's my philosophy. I don't think anybody who doesn't care should try to
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.600]   reproduce what I do. For me, it's fun. But I do think that somebody who is getting out of debt
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.440]   and who has never budgeted, man, they need to have YNAB, they need to budget every dollar in
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.240]   advance, they need to have that thing dialed in because they're making behavioral changes in their
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.720]   life. >> Andy:
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.000]   Makes sense. I can follow all that and agree, I think. >> Jared: Any other questions, Andy?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.720]   >> Andy: Do you have any suggestions for anything that is an offline tool that's more similar?
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:16:01.520]   Basically, if you were to use YNAB as you have it, but do an auto import, because I just don't like
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.440]   copying things over, is there any other tool that does that that's not cloud-based that you know of?
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:14.400]   >> Jared: The problem is, so I'm not aware of any. There is Tiller, which is built on Google
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.720]   Sheets, but then again, you have all your data in Google and it's cloud-based. But that was what
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.560]   they kind of built their business on. Tiller, I think it's a great solution for people who don't
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.320]   mind their data being there. I think it's a great solution because it accomplishes the auto import
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:39.680]   function, but it gives you just the ability to work within spreadsheets. For me, the data entry
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:48.240]   is certainly an impediment for a lot of people. I guess for me, I don't have that. I try to minimize
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:57.200]   the number of transactions and it's just not that big of a deal to me to spend. It probably takes me
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.840]   15 minutes a week and I enjoy it. I put on a podcast or listen to something, sit down at my
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   computer, pull all the receipts out of my wallet. I keep a three by five card in my wallet and then
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.320]   so if I don't get a receipt, I just write down the amount of money that I spend. Because if I'm
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.040]   spending something, all of my, if everything is just automatically done, but if I'm spending
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.120]   something, I always spend cash and just takes a little bit of time. But beyond that, I don't have
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.960]   an answer. I think probably if YNAB were to cancel and not allow me to use their legacy version of
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.560]   the software, because I don't want to be on the cloud, I would go back to my spreadsheet solution
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.920]   and just use a local spreadsheet on my PC. I'm not a total spreadsheet wizard, but I'm good enough
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.200]   that I can program them to give me what I want out of the deal.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:48.960]   Cool, makes sense. All right, thank you for calling in. Anything else before I go on to the
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:56.560]   written questions? I would be curious to hear about, I would agree with you on the idea that
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:04.240]   anything you put online is probably going to get leaked at some point and hacked. I've taken a lot
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:13.120]   of my life out of the mainstream computer system and followed a lot of Justin Carroll's advice on
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.360]   stuff and I've found it's made my life a whole lot harder. If I am asked to defend why I do things
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.600]   in a more difficult way, it's hard for me to articulate why that getting leaked would actually
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.240]   hurt me. I don't like the idea of someone having all my financial information, but if they have
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.880]   a million people's financial transaction, I don't have a bunch of embarrassing, I'm not running an
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:44.480]   anti-pornography campaign and also buying porn and having a porn budget. How would you defend that
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:51.520]   as being worth the extra time and hassle in general? You get a sneak peek. I have in my
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   show topics that maybe I'll do someday, I have a category called, I think my working title is,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:09.920]   "How Pursuit of Privacy Has Hurt Me." I'll give you just a preview for it. Yes, I would say that
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:18.000]   if you try to – Justin Carroll's been on the show and he's the co-author of several books on
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.200]   privacy. I've appeared on the – it's called the Privacy, Security and OSINT Show now with Justin
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.520]   Carroll and his former co-host Michael Bizzell. I did a show on financial privacy with them.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:35.360]   And if you go from kind of the normal existence that most of us go where we never know anything
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.320]   about privacy and then you try to start layering on some of the hardcore privacy tactics and
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:46.960]   techniques that they teach, it certainly does make things more complex, more complicated.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.840]   And I think that I've thought about this and I think there have been a number of negative
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.520]   results that I have experienced because of embracing more privacy techniques.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   Now, by personality, I'm a doer. So, I wouldn't be content with just saying, "Oh, I've learned
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.360]   about this without doing it." I like to try stuff. And for me, it's fun to say, "Okay, I'm going to
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.480]   go radical and hardcore in this direction. I'm going to see everything that I can do." And then
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.440]   I figure you can always back things off. But there have been some very significant costs to me of
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.200]   doing that. I'll give you the most significant cost. I had a Gmail account that I used from the
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.600]   time that Gmail first was created, somewhere around 2005 to 2000 and whatever, a few years ago.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:40.640]   And it was a primary Gmail account that had everything arranged in it. It was my primary
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.760]   thing. Just like most of us, you have your primary Gmail account. I decided that I was not happy with
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.800]   everything that Google was doing. And I decided that I was going to take some of my data out of
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.960]   Google. I wasn't at the point where I was ready to just say, "I don't use Google," although that
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.360]   appeals to me. But I wasn't at the point where I could say that. But I was at the point where I was
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.280]   ready to say, "I'll pull some data out of Google." So, what I did was pull a lot of my personal data
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.960]   off my Google profile. I deleted my address. I deleted basically all of my information off of
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:19.120]   the Google profile. But I had my username and my password. And I think I had a two-factor
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.040]   authentication on the account with a hardware token. Yeah, I did. I had a two-factor authentication on
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.080]   the account with a hardware token. And so, I thought, "Well, I'm fine. I'm good to go."
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.640]   So, then one day, I decided I was just going to clear out some of my old emails. And I went
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.040]   through and I started deleting just hundreds and thousands of old emails from the archive,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.800]   just because I didn't see any reason to keep that stuff around. I've tried to live lightly and
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.760]   decided to get rid of it. And then all of a sudden, Google kicks me out. I'm in the middle
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.200]   of deleting emails and Google kicks me out. So, then I come back and I try to log into my Gmail
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.920]   account. I thought that was weird. Try to log in. Well, I have my username. I have my password,
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.880]   which is a complex password. It's a good password. And I have my two-factor authentication key. But
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.960]   they asked me for additional security questions. The problem is that because I had removed all of
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:15.520]   my data from my Google profile, the only security question that the computer could ask me
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.360]   was, "When did I open this Google account?" And remember, I would have opened it sometime back
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.880]   when Google first came out, which was in 2004, I think, was their first year. And here it is,
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:34.720]   I think, 2017, 2018. I think it was 2017. So, I have no idea when I first opened this Google
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.080]   account. So, I start trying to give an answer and I get booted. So, then we go in and we try
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.120]   to authenticate through the google.com/recover and doesn't work, doesn't work. And the computer
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.080]   is stuck because it has no data in my profile for it to ask me security questions to let me in,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.200]   except for when I opened the Google account. So, then I tried different dates, different months,
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.960]   and it won't let me in. And that started the most frustrating experience I have ever had with a
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.360]   company. So, first, try to figure out how do you get somebody from Gmail on the phone, because
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.760]   Google is very difficult to contact. Well, you can't get anyone from Gmail on the phone. So,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.440]   you wind up bouncing around all the different Google places. Then I said, well, here's what I
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.840]   can do. And I had the idea to go get Google Business, because if you have a Google Business
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.000]   account, then you can access a customer service representative. So, I can't upgrade the account
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.880]   that I need help on, because I can't get into it to authenticate in. So, I upgrade another one of
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.800]   my Google accounts to a Google Business account so that I can talk to a Google employee. And
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.480]   so, I talked to them. And basically, after hours and hours and hours, I am told that there is
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.600]   nothing we can do, that there is no person at Google, no one at the company, no programmer,
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.560]   no anybody with high authorization. There's no person at Google that can override the computer.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:00.080]   The only way for me to get into my Google account is to use google.com/recover to recover the
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:06.240]   password. And I'm stuck. And I can't even upgrade my the account in question, because I can't get
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.800]   in. And so, I wound up locked out for the last few years. I wound up locked out of my primary
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:19.760]   Gmail account, my primary Google account that had everything in my life associated with it.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.120]   Anybody who emailed me, anybody, communications, personal friends, everything, every newsletter,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:32.080]   everything I'm locked out of. I found that the most frustrating thing, because I have my username,
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.880]   I have my password, I have my authentication, but their computer doesn't like me. And their computer
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.720]   thinks that I'm not me. And their computer thinks it's going to be so smart, and the humans don't
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.160]   control the computers. So, that's kind of a story. It's a cautionary tale. I have learned not to mess
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:52.640]   around with Google accounts. And I've learned to make sure don't clear your data out of a Google
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:59.120]   profile. I learned the hard way. But that has been unbelievably costly to me over the last few years
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:05.520]   in time, in money, and in hassle to be locked out of my primary email account. And it's frankly just
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.200]   flabbergasting to me that a company would be at—we're at the point where people can't control
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.440]   computers, where the computers are in charge, and the people just are servants of the computer.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.640]   I say, "Sorry, the computer's in charge. I can't do anything about it." And it has strengthened
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.240]   my deep antipathy for Google. If any of you guys have any help, I've searched help forums,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.280]   I've called, I've spoken to half a dozen Google representatives. But if any of you are wizards
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.000]   of that, then you can help me out. So, that would be an example of how it's really cost me, Andy.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.480]   But then there are other costs to privacy as well. And for me, just to sum it up the story,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.000]   I don't have anything that I'm ashamed of. I don't have any skeletons in my closet. I've
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.200]   confessed all my sins. I don't have anybody that I've hurt or that I am hurting. There's nothing
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.960]   private. You can't even talk on a microphone and do what I do and basically keep your life private.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:06.000]   But I still want to be a constant advocate for privacy as a human right and as a civil right.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.800]   And so, for me, it's important to me to be a practitioner of privacy out of an ideological
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:21.200]   commitment to the cause. I do not believe that it is right, moral, ethical, in any way acceptable
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.640]   that the government of the United States says, "Well, we're just going to read every email. We're
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.800]   going to listen to every phone call. We're going to record all the metadata." And so, I have a
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:35.360]   choice. I can either do nothing, which for me, I'm not willing to do that. I can sit around and moan
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.080]   and gripe and complain about something that I can't change. I can't change them. Or I can take
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:49.840]   action and I can use the tools that are available. So, I can encrypt. I can conceal. I can remove
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.680]   data. And it's not because I'm scared of anything, although certainly I think there are very
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:59.920]   legitimate concerns that one could have. I don't worry about those things too much as an American.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.160]   If I were in another country where there were much more of a predilection towards tyranny and
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:12.160]   violence on individuals just because of politically incorrect speech, that would be one thing.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.680]   Although I think that's growing in the United States, especially in the kind of the public
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:21.600]   facing world. But for me, it's a matter of ideology. I want to support people's rights to
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.120]   privacy. You have the right to privacy in your home. You have the right to privacy in your affairs,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.400]   in your papers, in your persons, in your effects. And because of that, I'm going to be part of the
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.080]   solution. I'm going to be part of one of those who practices private methodologies. I'm going
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.760]   to be one of those who promotes that, who teaches others to do it. Because until that happens,
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.240]   until we use the tools that we have, I don't see how things change in the better direction.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.000]   So it's costly. It's cost me time, money, frustration. There have been things that
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.640]   have been harmed. And I don't think extreme privacy — there's Bazell's newest book — I
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.760]   don't think that extreme privacy is the right solution for everybody. But I do think that if
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.720]   more of us simply made a few of the smaller, easier changes, it would have a dramatic effect
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:18.240]   on our society. Thanks. I think that basically is exactly where I'm at. I was hoping you'd have
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.520]   some really encouraging thing to make me get back on the wagon and be more private than I am now.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   But I do definitely agree with the idea that it's a human right and that if you don't exercise that,
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.480]   you will lose it. And I think also just look to see where it's hurting you. For example,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.320]   Sudo is a great app. It's a great app for phones. If I were trying to run a business where I needed
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.000]   to be connected on the phone, there's not a chance in the world I would be doing anything except
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.920]   using a standard cell phone, a standard phone. You can't reliably run a business on something
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   like Sudo. Things like social media. I have decided — we will announce it on social media — but I
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:05.440]   have a deep level of antipathy for Facebook. I get annoyed with Twitter. But what I have decided
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:12.480]   recently after years of frustration and kind of wrestling with it is I care more about my primary
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:19.200]   mission. I care more about serving you, my listeners. And I want to make an impact on you,
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.840]   my listeners. And although I don't care for the social media companies and many of their
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:33.920]   practices because many of the things they do I find deeply offensive, I've decided to not be so
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.080]   ideological. I'm trying to be less, you know, principled and just focus on my primary mission
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.680]   which is to serve people and to help people to live a rich and meaningful life now while building
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.640]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. So I've decided I'm going to start engaging with
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.040]   YouTube. I'm going to start creating YouTube videos. I'm going to re-engage with Facebook.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.960]   I've not engaged with Facebook in a very long time. I'm going to engage in Twitter more because
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.160]   of my higher commitment. And I'm not trying to build a brand on privacy. I care about it,
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:12.240]   but I care more about impacting and helping people who need help. So I think I don't see any other
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.640]   solution other than to say if something's hurting you and it's not actually allowing you to fulfill
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.560]   your core mission and those things that are important for you, I think it would be foolish
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.400]   and illogical to do something that's harming you if you have more benefit from the alternative.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.680]   >> Andy: Thanks. That's a really good way to put that, I think.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.520]   >> Josh: My pleasure. Andy, thank you for calling in today. I'm going to move on to
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.760]   the written questions, but I appreciate your live call.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.440]   >> Andy: Yes, thank you.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.400]   >> Josh: Next question I will take was written in by a patron of the show on our Patreon page

[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.280]   John in California writes in this, says, "Joshua, I'd appreciate your comments on this.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.120]   How do you feel about my taking ownership of a piece of inherited property as a married man,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:07.920]   as my sole and separate property? My siblings and I recently purchased a condo with inherited
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.520]   assets from my mother. We all took ownership individually without our spouses, which has
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   created some hard feelings. Was this the right thing to do, as now we understand this condo
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.120]   would now go to our children rather than spouses, since they were all required to sign a quitclaim
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:32.080]   deed? Would we now be able to place the asset into our individual trust and leave it to our spouse,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.520]   or does the quitclaim deed preclude that? Thank you."
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:42.000]   So, John, I will tackle this in the best I can. To the specifics of the situation,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.480]   I'm not competent to address. I am not an attorney practicing in California,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.080]   and perhaps there's some wrinkle in the California law that I don't know of.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:58.720]   So, let's talk about it from a general perspective. I'll probably be about 80% right on this error,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.440]   and then you can find some other person in your area who can point out the 20% where I'm wrong.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:13.120]   First, the context, the idea of separate property versus community property. California is a
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:19.360]   community property state. So, of course, being a community property state, all of your property
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.600]   and your wife's property is considered to be owned equally by you. However, even in a community
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:32.320]   property state, there are exceptions. In a community property state, you have marital property
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.640]   and you have separate property. The thing that makes a community property state different than
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.000]   a non-community property state is that all marital property is understood to be divided,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.680]   owned 50/50 by each spouse, even if it's only titled in one spouse's name. That's different
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:54.080]   than a non-community property state. Marital property is any property that is acquired
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.920]   during the marriage. So, even though you live in a community property state, you still do have
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:06.800]   separate property. So, for example, if you had a boat that you owned before you were married,
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.920]   that's not community property. That's your separate property, unless later after the
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:19.200]   marriage you title the boat into both of you and your spouse's name. And so, that's one thing.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.800]   Now, it is very easy in a community property state to wind up accidentally having separate
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.000]   property commingled to become part of the community property. So, if you have a bank
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.360]   account and you put money from your bank account into a joint bank account and you had the money
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.120]   before marriage, it's automatically now community property. Now, an inheritance that you receive
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:48.080]   during marriage goes back and forth depending on the specific state. And I'm guessing the
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.640]   California law probably requires you to establish a separate transmutation agreement in order for
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:01.360]   you to keep the property as separate property. So, if you, generally, the way that inheritances work
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.840]   is if you inherit something from your family, it's not considered to be your wife's property,
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.960]   it wasn't marital property, it's your separate property. But, generally, you have to have it
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:17.200]   in an established transmutation agreement, which is basically like a post-nuptial agreement where
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.520]   each of you, you and your spouse, agree to keep your property separate and outside of the community
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:29.840]   estate. And if you have that knowledgeable, that consent, as you stated that you have in the
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.440]   question, you have that transmutation agreement, then you can make sure that you keep the property
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.320]   as separate property. So, the question here is why would you do this? And then we'll get to,
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:49.040]   was it a good idea? Why is this important? I don't see many reasons to do this outside of the concept
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:55.840]   of divorce. I'm trying to think if I can think of any reasons for estate planning, why this would
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.560]   be important, or for any kind of tax planning, but I don't get the sense here that we're talking about
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:07.920]   that much of an amount. You're talking about a condo here. It doesn't seem like we're talking
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.360]   about millions and millions of dollars. So, to me, then we could say, why did we do this?
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.800]   Again, I'm not good enough on California law to know quick claim deed. I don't see how a quick
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.440]   claim deed would come into the affair. It seemed like it's a transmutation agreement, but maybe I'm
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:31.440]   just ignorant. So, why should you do this? Well, the reason most people do this is to protect
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:37.200]   separate property, and the obvious thing that can happen is when we come into the world of divorce.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.240]   If your mom dies, leaves you $500,000 of cash, and you use that to buy a condo,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:49.200]   then, and that would be, that's the line of legal reasoning here. If you use that $500,000 of cash
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.760]   to buy a condo, then that condo would now be part of your community property. So, now, if you and
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:59.600]   your wife divorce, and if the judge splits your estate 50/50, now your wife has a 50% claim in
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.960]   that condo. So, what you're basically trying to do in the arrangement that you've set up is you're
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.600]   saying, I've got this 50% asset over here. I've got this asset, this $500,000 inheritance from my
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.640]   mother, and now I'm going to change this from being cash, which as long as I kept it in a
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.120]   separate account, it was clearly identified as separate property because it was an inheritance,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.360]   but I'm going to turn it into a condo. And because we're acquiring the condo during marriage,
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.800]   if my wife doesn't sign the transmutation agreement, then we don't have the clarity
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.760]   that this is definitely my separate property. Well, I can certainly understand why that would
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:42.320]   create hard feelings on your wife's part, certainly. And you can imagine it too. If your
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.800]   wife had a half a million dollar inheritance, and she said, I'm going to take this inheritance and
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.120]   use it to buy something that I'm not going to put your name on, why would she be doing that?
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.560]   Well, it's going to come down largely to divorce. See, if you're talking about this as some kind of
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.240]   estate planning thing, I don't see any benefit. Unless you have a big estate and we're trying to
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.080]   deal with taxes, that would be one legitimate thing. But in that case, I would guess that
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.560]   why would there be any hardship? Why would there be any hard feelings? Because you would understand.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.720]   But there's not going to be any tax considerations here. Your estate tax situation is basically going
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.480]   to be exactly the same, whether it's your property that you own a separate property
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.480]   versus community property. So I don't see any benefit here from an estate planning perspective.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.800]   So we basically just come down to the possibility of divorce. How do you protect the asset in case
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:32.720]   of the possibility of divorce? And that's the really thorny issue. I've been asked many times,
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.520]   and I need to address it, about things like prenuptial agreements prior to marriage.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:44.560]   And it's one of the most difficult decisions, difficult conversations that I can think of,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.760]   because it's very hard to answer. On the one hand, I question why, if you are worried about the need
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:57.600]   for a prenuptial agreement, I question if anybody should marry. And yet, on the other hand, the
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:04.320]   risks of marriage, especially the financial risks, are so great that it almost seems foolish to marry
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.200]   without a prenuptial agreement. And I will at some point do the shows on prenuptial planning
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.800]   and prenuptial agreements, so you're educated on it. And I think I'm mostly against them,
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.560]   because if you have to have a prenuptial agreement, I don't think you should marry
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:25.840]   in the first place, and because I think they violate the spirit of marriage. But on the other
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.160]   hand, I do see that there could be a place somewhere. But I don't think you're going to
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:37.360]   get through them without some hard feelings, or some at least questions, and good, open,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   honest questions. Now, it's a lot easier if you do that before you're married. For example,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.920]   I think that spouses before, or engaged persons, or at least people who are in a serious relationship
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.680]   and engaged, I think people who are in a serious relationship and engaged to one another should do
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.080]   a background check, should hire a private investigator to do a background check on the
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:05.360]   person that they propose to marry. But I think you also should talk about it. And it's one of
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.640]   those things where that's not a popular opinion, but I look at the, when you look at the cases,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.880]   you look at the stories that you read, and I realize just how much could be solved with a
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.120]   simple background check by a professional investigator for many people. It seems
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.640]   short-sighted and very risky for me for someone to marry without a background check, especially,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:30.160]   and my caveat would be especially if somebody is older. If you grew up in the same town as your
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:37.520]   fiancé, and you went to high school together, and you started dating at 17 years old, and you're 21
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.040]   years old, and you're getting married, I think it's not that important. But a lot of people are
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:46.800]   not in that situation. You met your spouse or your fiancé two years ago, and now you're 36 years old
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.560]   and planning to marry, I think you need to do a background check. And then when it comes to the
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:56.000]   assets, I think you need to talk about divorce and talk about things and say what's the situation.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.760]   But it's a lot easier to do that before marriage versus after marriage. If you're doing this with
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:06.560]   your wife, basically the only financial thing that I can, any financial reason that I can see
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:12.480]   why you would be working very diligently to keep this as separate property would be to reserve it
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:18.320]   for your benefit in the case of divorce. So if I'm wrong, am I missing something, write me back
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.280]   and tell me. Tell me about some little financial thing that I'm not aware of. But the only reason
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:29.760]   I can see for you to have done this was because you want to make sure that your inheritance is
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.320]   not commingled into the community property that is kept as your separate property. And the only
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:41.120]   benefit that I can see of that is to protect you so that you can maintain the full ownership of
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:48.480]   that asset in case of divorce instead of losing 50%. Now, will the... So, it's a tough conversation.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:55.600]   And if you're just... I don't see how I can go any farther. Now, will the condo automatically go to
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:01.280]   your children? Well, I would say that the asset will now pass according to your will.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.200]   But it would be the same even if you and your spouse had community property. The place where
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.320]   I think this kind of planning makes the most sense and where it's usually the easiest is when you're
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:18.880]   seeking to work with blended families. Husband and wife both have married and divorced, both have
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   children from their first marriage. In those situations, most of the time, once somebody has
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.960]   married and divorced, they are distinctly conscious of the fact that their marriage may end again.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.280]   And because they have children from their first marriage, they're often seeking to protect their
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.640]   children. And those financial planning conversations are generally a lot easier to negotiate because
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.000]   it's a matter of we want to make sure that these assets go to protect our separate children. And
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.520]   we don't want to try to make my new spouse's assets go to inherit my children. And so, it
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.800]   would seem simple, simpler. Hopefully, I've given you some thought on the question. If I'm missing
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.200]   something, if I'm missing any other benefits of this, just any listener, send me an email,
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:04.960]   josh@radicalpersonalfinance.com. I'd love to know. But certainly, I can see why it would be a touchy
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:13.200]   conversation. If my wife came to me and she said to me, "I've just inherited $500,000 and I'm going
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.480]   to make sure that I'm very careful to keep it as separate property rather than for us to manage it
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.240]   and use it together," I would find that—and I'm going to do it legally with all kinds of legal
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:30.800]   protections—I would find that a really offensive thing. I do think that I would—like, if that were
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:42.640]   to happen, I do think that it's right for me to be very quiet about the direction and to let her have
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:50.560]   the lead in terms of the use of the money because of acknowledging that it's her family's estate,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:57.840]   her side of the family. But when we married, I gave her everything and she gave me everything.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.680]   And so to all of a sudden start on that foundation and then to introduce this concept of yours and
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.120]   mine and ours in the middle of marriage would, for me, break the fabric of the basic meaning
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.400]   of marriage. So I can understand your wife's offense. How you navigate that, though, I don't
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:21.680]   know. I would talk with her openly about it and work to resolve any offense that there is. Joe
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.600]   writes in with this question, "Joshua, advice that you've given me in the past about focusing
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.560]   on my economic engine has been incredibly inspiring. Right now, our economic engine is
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.120]   our ability to earn. With that, we're piling up money and working our way through some debt. We
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.960]   look forward to deploying the capital into rental properties, planning our first residential rental
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.760]   next year." Joe, attaboy. Good job. "My question today, we would like to start keeping a modest
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:50.240]   supply of food and water in case of emergency. Can you give some advice on how to begin prepping
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.280]   and what type and sort of food you recommend to start with? I understand a lot of freeze-dried
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.880]   food requires not only potable water, but also heat. What about the canned route? Also, do you
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.840]   have any tips on emergency medicine for beginners? Any advice or pointers to existing sources would
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.680]   be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Joseph." Well, Joe, as it just so happens, I have a podcast on
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:17.120]   that. So the first thing you can do is on your phone, wherever you listen to your podcast,
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:23.040]   whatever RSS feeder you use, scroll way, way back in the archives of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:32.960]   You will find episode 384 is called A Sensible Approach to Food Insurance, aka Home Food Storage.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.320]   That show is a little bit about the philosophy behind food storage, reasons for you to store
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:46.160]   food, etc. It was released on October 14, 2016. Then the next episode, October 14, 2016, episode
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.320]   385, A Sensible Approach to Food Insurance, Home Food Storage, two of two, wherein I talked about
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:59.840]   a sensible way to actually build food storage. And following that, you will find the audio
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.320]   of a seminar called Sensible Food Storage by a lady named Wendy DeWitt. And that would be a
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.480]   good place for you to listen. Then again, you'll find audio of something in the archives there
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:19.520]   called, in October 14, 2016, audio of Stephen Harris's Family Emergency Preparedness Class,
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.480]   which is a family emergency preparedness class that is filled with very practical tips on basic
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:30.000]   emergency preparedness. And then you will find episode 381 of my show is called Simple Cheap
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.360]   Practical Tips to Help You Prepare for a Coming Hurricane, where I talk about the basic, really
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.520]   simple things to do to prepare for a hurricane, which of course is very timely as Hurricane
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.160]   Dorian threatens Florida, as I record this on August 30, 2019. So all of those shows will get
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.760]   you started in the right direction. Now, here, in answer to your question, I want to give you just a
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.400]   brief overview, though, afresh of what you can do, because I don't remember what I said in those
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.560]   shows. I would imagine that it's probably about what I think today, because I haven't changed
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:07.120]   much on the subjects, but I'll give you kind of a useful way to approach it. What I like to do is I
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:14.000]   like to think of preparedness, preparing, prepping, in terms of a phased approach based upon the
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.520]   amount of time that you need to prepare for. If you stop and think about a hurricane, or maybe
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:28.160]   in your case an earthquake or some kind of thing like that, you have an ideal mental picture of
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   what could happen. Let's stick with a hurricane, because I'm most familiar with hurricanes over
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.080]   earthquakes, but basically the same. You get more advanced warning with a hurricane, so it's a
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:42.560]   benefit. If your hurricane comes through town, it blows all the trees down, knocks out the power,
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:50.080]   and knocks out the basic services for a week, you stop and think, "What would I need for a week
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:57.600]   to provide for myself and my family? What would be the basic needs?" Your needs will be different
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:04.480]   based upon who you are and where you're located. In Florida, we don't worry too much about
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.520]   preparing for ice storms, so backup heating is not a thing for Floridians to worry about in terms of
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:17.040]   prepping. We don't think about kerosene stoves and wood fireplaces and such like that. The
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:23.280]   coldest it ever gets can be easily solved by two blankets on top of your bed. But if you are living
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.720]   in Minnesota and you're worrying about a winter blizzard, backup heating is going to be very high
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.920]   on the list, higher than food, higher than water, because you could freeze very quickly. And if you
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.040]   don't have some sort of backup heat source or some way to trap the heat of your bodies and such so
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.920]   that you're comfortable, then you could die very quickly. And so you stop and think about your
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:49.760]   particular scenario, and you think about, "What would happen if I lost services?" Now, whatever
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:56.960]   seems the most intuitive to you to do, do that. So freeze-dried food, for most people, is not
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.320]   intuitive, unless you actively use the stuff because you go backpacking all the time. But I
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:08.000]   don't think it makes any sense for you to buy and store freeze-dried food until you just buy some
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.480]   extra of the stuff that you're normally accustomed to buying and owning. And if you do that, you will
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:21.920]   start to lay in a supply of the stuff that you usually use. If you eat canned food and you eat
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.960]   canned chicken and canned tuna, then buy canned food. Buy canned chicken and canned tuna. If you
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.240]   use saltine crackers to put your tuna fish on, then buy a couple extra boxes of saltine crackers.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:39.360]   And in just one or two trips to the grocery store, you can have enough food to protect you and to
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.320]   make sure that your family can eat for a week or a couple of extra weeks. And I think for the first
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   few weeks, you really shouldn't do anything different than buy your normal stuff. That's
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:57.360]   really it. Now, the other thing is, of course, water. Well, it's very easy for anybody to simply
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.800]   store water to get them through a week or two. What I do and what I recommend, go to Costco,
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.640]   buy a bunch of those flats of 24 packs of water bottles, individual, what are they, 24-ounce water
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.600]   bottles, 18-ounce water bottles, just the standard packs that you use if you're going to a picnic,
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:24.000]   and buy a whole bunch of those and stash them aside. It's water. They're $3.72 for 24 bottles.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.280]   It winds up being, the numbers are faded for me at this point in time, but I think it's about
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:37.120]   five gallons of water per tray. So in general, the advice is store about a gallon per person per day.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.840]   So if you've got a family of five and you're planning for seven days, five gallons a day
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:48.480]   times seven, 35 gallons of water. Well, that's pretty simple. It's only seven or eight or 10
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.160]   of those trays of water bottles. The reason I like that is because those water bottles are
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:50:01.280]   super useful. They're, of course, super useful in an emergency because they're individual servings.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:07.600]   And so unlike trying to hoist a five-gallon jug up somewhere and pour water out of that,
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   or go and tap a 55-gallon barrel of water, you've just got bottles of water and they're easy to
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.560]   drink. You take one out, you drink it when you're thirsty and you're done.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.440]   They're also really multifunctional. So if your neighbor doesn't have water, you can easily share
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:27.040]   now. And one of the most important reasons to be prepared is so that you can help your family and
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.680]   your friends and your neighbors who are probably not going to prepare. And you need to make sure
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.400]   that you've planned ahead so that you have enough to help others who are in need. That's your
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:41.840]   responsibility to be a good neighbor, a good family member, to take care of those who are in need.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:47.520]   And so things like that are really easy to share. It's hard to share a five-gallon jug of water.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:52.480]   It's hard to share a water filter, but it's easy to share a tray of water bottles among
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:58.560]   people who are thirsty. The other reason I like to start with that is because it's super easy to
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.520]   use those things. After maybe a year, a couple of years sitting there, water's not going to go bad.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:09.680]   It's totally fine. But you go ahead and just toss it into a cooler and take it to the beach and just
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   cycle it out. It's probably unnecessary, but of course you wonder about the water and the plastic
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.640]   leaching in. You certainly don't want them to be in heat because of course water and heat and
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.920]   plastic is not good, but if they're in a cool dry place, it's fine. And so you go to Costco and you
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.800]   buy 10 trays of water and then you do it again a week later and buy 10 trays of water and you make
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.840]   a stack down in the corner of the basement, a little stack here, a little stack there, and
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:38.800]   you've got water. From there, you can go to something like shelter. And when they talk about
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:44.960]   prepping, you'll often hear prepping teachers talk about food, water, shelter, and security,
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:52.400]   personal security. And you can debate around what's more important and how do you approach it.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.800]   You'll often hear people talk about the rule of threes when they teach preparedness,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.480]   disaster preparedness, where they say you can survive for three minutes without air,
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.160]   three hours without shelter, three days without water, and three weeks without food.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:12.240]   So when you think about that, it gives you a priority of where do you start. Now air and
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.720]   oxygen is certainly a little bit more unique, but it does play a role. And so that's where you make
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:25.360]   sure you have things like masks, dust masks, et cetera. Shelter is where, hey, if I get caught
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.400]   out in the cold or if I get caught out in the wind, et cetera, what do we do? What do we do if
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.240]   the roof gets ripped off of our house? So shelter means different things to different people.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:38.880]   In the cold country, it's going to mean how do I make sure that if we don't have any source of
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.920]   heating that how do we maintain body heat? So can we build a tent in the living room? Can we put
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   extra blankets around so we all sleep together on one mattress and keep ourselves warm? There's no
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.360]   need for me to go into all those details, but you start to think about that. And then of course,
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:57.600]   water and food line up. So what I say is start by thinking about a couple of weeks, say a week,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:04.000]   two weeks without shelter. And then the next thing that you'll quickly go to would be to something
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.040]   like energy. And with energy and that show, I've talked about what I think it makes the most sense
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:15.680]   for people is to start with making sure that you have a battery backup system in your home.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.520]   The teacher who is most popularized this and made it very accessible, Stephen Harris,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.320]   who's been on the show. And he has a number of different things about that. He teaches
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.480]   and sells a course on how to set up a home battery bank. I think it makes all the sense in the world.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.080]   Super simple. Make sure that you have a deep cycle battery or a handful of deep cycle batteries or
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.320]   golf cart batteries. You make sure that you have a battery charger to charge those. And then you
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:43.520]   make sure that you have an inverter to connect to those chargers. And then you also have the ability
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.640]   to pull direct 12 volt power off of that. So the last hurricane, when I was working with a friend
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:54.960]   who was not prepared for the hurricane, I took him to Costco and we bought food. We bought water,
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.080]   just the random packaged food that was there from Costco, jerky and nuts and whatever else is there,
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:06.240]   granola bars and cereal, et cetera. Bought shelf stable milk so he could drink cereal, bread, kind
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.880]   of the typical stuff that all leads out of the grocery store. Bought some water. Then I made
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.440]   sure to go and buy him a deep cycle battery. A deep cycle battery from the battery department,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:21.600]   a hundred bucks, an inverter off of that battery, and then a battery charger to charge that battery.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.640]   And so the basic concept here is how do you create and develop a source of electricity so that you
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.440]   can run your phones, so that you can run a TV, so that you can run a radio, so that you can run
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:35.760]   radios to communicate with people, radios to listen to radio signals, et cetera.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.160]   Keep the kids, if your kids play video games, how do you keep video games going, things like that,
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:46.240]   and lights. And then what I have done and taught is to standardize everything off of 12 volt power.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.880]   So when there's a hurricane coming through town, you put a deep cycle battery on your kitchen
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.960]   counter. You put off of that a couple of clips so that you have some USB ports so you can charge up
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:02.000]   all the devices that all run on USB. You have an inverter that you can use to charge up anything
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:09.120]   that runs off of 110 volts. And then you have battery chargers to charge up AA, AAA batteries.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.800]   And pretty much that solves most of your needs for a week or two. Beyond that, you don't need
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.200]   much. You can run lights at night. And then you look around and think. So for example,
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.480]   if you, what I, best investment I ever bought for emergency preparedness, I was at Costco
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:32.080]   and they were selling these decorative candles. And the decorative candles are little LED flickering
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:37.920]   candles, but they run on three AA batteries. And the things run forever on AA batteries. Well,
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.040]   I have a massive supply of rechargeable AA batteries that I can recharge from everything
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.800]   that's available. And, and, and they, you, you take those, you screw them around your house,
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.560]   and now you have a source of light in all of your rooms. And those things, I did the calculations
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:00.160]   one time, they can run hundreds of hours on one set of AA batteries. So you can leave them on day
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.920]   and night when your shutters are up and your house is dark and everything is squared away.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.640]   Now you can go beyond that. And you think about how do I keep my food fresh? And so that's where
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.800]   you think, how do I run my refrigerator? Well, there, the first step is of course an inverter,
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.440]   because you can use your car as a primary power source, run your engine, take an inverter on your
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.320]   battery, plug with an extension cord, your refrigerator into that, run your car for an hour,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.160]   and it'll charge your refrigerator. Then you naturally, of course, move into the world of
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:31.680]   generators and say, how do I run a generator? And what kind of generator do I have? Generators
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.760]   have become very inexpensive, bunch of options there. I'll show you, share with you just a few
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.840]   of my favorite tips. And I'm trying to compress this into a 15 or 20 minute answer, but frankly,
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:48.720]   I probably can, I could teach a 50 hour class on this. And cause I think obsessively about it. And
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:54.480]   so how do I convert compress 50 hours to 15 minutes? I have no idea, but you're getting
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:00.640]   the best I got. So with an generator strategy, what I think makes a lot of sense is to start
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:06.880]   simple, start small. So a few things that you can do. Number one, start with your car as an
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.920]   inverter. It's not a great long-term solution, but it can keep your deep freezer and your refrigerator
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:17.600]   going for a few days until the power comes back on. Then you move to a generator and there are a
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.960]   number of different generator options. What I prefer that's the easiest, I think for most people
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:30.880]   is a relatively small generator that will run on dual fuel. And so what I think works really well
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:38.160]   is the champion dual fuel generators that come from the factory, ready to run either on gasoline
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.640]   or on propane. You can get great deals on them. Now there are other good, there are lots of good
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.840]   generators out there, but what I think you should do is if you have the money, buy an inverter
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:53.120]   generator. They're a lot quieter and they're more fuel efficient than the big loud ones. Of course,
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.440]   those are cheaper, but get an inverter generator because you use it in a lot more circumstances.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.040]   My recommendation, go to a website called supergenproducts.com. And what they sell on that
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:08.320]   website is they sell all of the returns to Costco. And so they're a champion refurbisher,
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:14.160]   and you can go on there and buy a champion 2000, 3000, 4000 watt generator, but get one that runs
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.680]   on dual fuel from the factory. The reason I like dual fuel is because you can store propane and you
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.840]   can store it in a way where you don't have to cycle it. Now, I of course think everybody should
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:30.320]   store gasoline. So as part of prepping, you should store gasoline. You should store minimum at least
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:38.480]   two tanks worth of gasoline from your car. So most people should store, if your car has a fuel tank
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:44.640]   of 20 gallons, you should store 40 gallons of fuel. It's not hard. That's five, sorry, my math
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:50.080]   is broken today. That's eight little five gallon fuel containers, which anybody can store. But what
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.240]   that gives you the ability to do, if there's a hurricane coming to town and the stores are sold
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:59.920]   out of gasoline, then you have 20 gallons that you can use to fill up your car. And then you have
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:04.000]   another 20 gallons that you can take with you strapped to your roof rack or put into a little
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.880]   bumper hitch or put onto a trailer. Or if in worst case scenario, you have to put inside the car,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:14.080]   better of course, and safer to keep it outside the car. But if you have to, then you can carry
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:19.200]   another 20 gallons with you so that you can now have basically with most vehicles, an effective
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:24.720]   range of 800 to a thousand miles of range. Now, just the ability to fill up your tank one time
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:31.680]   will get you out of range of the vast majority of things. But if you have two gas tanks worth of
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:37.040]   fuel, it's almost inconceivable the disaster that you couldn't get out of if you got 800 miles of
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:43.520]   driving range with your vehicle. I mean, we're talking super hardcore zombie apocalypse stuff,
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:49.120]   if you can't get out of danger with 800 miles of range. So simple suggestion is store gasoline.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.960]   And then of course, you use gasoline for a generator. If you could only have and afford
[00:59:52.960 --> 01:00:00.000]   a cheap 2000 watt generator, but then you can go and buy eight or 10, five gallon gas cans and keep
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.920]   them full of gas. That's what you should do instead of buying an expensive generator and not store
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.800]   any gas. The biggest problem that people with generators face is they don't store gas. So the
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.440]   problem is that when you store gasoline, it has a very short shelf life. It, after a year, a couple
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.560]   of years, it starts to go bad, even with fuel treatment stabilizers in it. And so you have to
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.680]   constantly rotate gasoline. Now you may be the kind of person who's willing to do it. I am, and
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.800]   I recommend it, but many people aren't. And so the best solution I have is use propane because
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.360]   propane, you can buy propane canisters and you can set them aside and store them in a shed or
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.480]   your garage out back somewhere. Think of the fire risk, of course. So store them somewhere safely.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.160]   The propane is stable for decades. So you can just as simply, simply systematically,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.960]   if you have a dual fuel generator that runs on propane, you can put that aside. You can
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.600]   buy each week, you buy another just standard 20 pound barbecue cylinder. What I would do is buy
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.800]   them new, use them a little bit on your standard barbecue and then refill them so that they're
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.200]   maximally full. And you can put aside another 20 pound cylinder per week until you have as much
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.600]   propane as you feel you should have. You can also buy larger cylinders. You can buy 30 pound
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.000]   cylinders, which you can manhandle, look to a place like Tractor Supply. You can do that there
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.040]   40 pound cylinders get pretty heavy, but they're still movable. Once you get beyond 40 pound
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.160]   cylinders, they start to not be movable. But you can then of course go to something like 100 pound
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.120]   cylinder. You can buy those from your local propane company. And there's a kind of kind of
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.240]   cylinder that they put on the back of a food truck or concession truck, or you can bury a tank in the
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.600]   backyard. And so now you move to a situation where because you can bury a propane tank from the,
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.680]   you know, few hundred gallons, even thousand gallons or whatever, it's standard throughout
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.400]   the US, you can put an above ground tank or a below ground tank. And if you create a generator
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.640]   that can run off a propane, you now create basically an inexhaustible power supply for
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.600]   yourself, which is really, really powerful. But my plans are building in in terms of finances.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.680]   Yeah, you can go all the way to a propane or natural gas, big giant tank or multiple tanks
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.760]   and a whole house generator, but that's not strictly necessary. You can start simpler with
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.240]   the with the portable model that I'm describing to you. So get one of those. And then the other
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.880]   benefit of propane is, in my experience, you never have to worry about your carburetors becoming
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.760]   varnished like you do with gasoline. The basic problem that happens with a generator is you get
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.800]   a generator, you use it with gasoline, you use it during the storm, and then you let it sit.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.480]   And then the gas goes bad in the tank, but worse, the carburetor gets varnished,
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.920]   because the gasoline in the carburetor just turns to lacquer. And then next time you go to start up
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.960]   the the generator, it won't start because the carburetor is broken. Now sometimes you can fix
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.280]   it, you run some seafoam through it, and you may be able to fix it. But in my experience, running a
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.000]   generator on propane, you never have any problem. So I can run my generator on propane, leave it
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.800]   sit for six months, go out, fires right up just just like it did right away, and I don't have to
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.680]   worry about the same problems. So I think propane is a really good solution for you to create and
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.600]   set up a generator. Now, moving on, and I promise we'll come back to food. Once you think about
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.000]   power, and if you're going to have a generator, you expand your options immeasurably. And then
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.480]   you can think about how do I standardize my equipment? How do I provide for myself? If,
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.520]   for example, you have an electric stove in your house, well now you don't have a way to cook if
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.480]   the electricity is out. So how are you going to cook? There are an inexhaustible number of ways
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.440]   that you could do it. You can have a solar oven, you can cook on a propane or a butane camp stove,
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.160]   you can get an induction hot plate, you can cook over an open fire in your cast iron dutch oven,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.680]   you can get your volcano stove and cook on that, you can build a rocket stove. I mean,
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.640]   there's just no limit to the number of different ways that you can do it. But one of the basic
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:54.080]   recommendations I would make is if you store fuel and you have a generator, then standardize a lot
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:00.160]   of things on electricity. So then you think about tools. Well, standardize your tools on rechargeable
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.880]   batteries. My tips on rechargeable batteries. There are a couple interesting things that you
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.440]   can do. First, the rechargeable batteries. I'm thinking here your 18 volt or your 20 volt or
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.920]   whatever, you know, think your DeWalt screw gun type of thing. If you standardize on those,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.600]   there are actually a lot of really interesting things that you can run on those. So you can have
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.520]   an emergency radio that runs on those. You can have lights that run on those, which can be helpful
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.320]   for your emergency preparedness. DeWalt has a system where you can use a bunch of those batteries
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:36.240]   and turn it into a battery pack. So you can do that. What I like the idea of is Home Depot has
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.360]   a system where if you buy the Home Depot brand, I think it's Rigid, but check me on that. I can't
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   remember right now. But if you buy the Home Depot brand of tools, they have a lifetime warranty
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.800]   on the tools that they sell, including batteries. But the trick is you have to register it when you
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.760]   buy it. But I think it makes a lot of sense to standardize on something like that. Home Depot
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.160]   likely to be around for quite a while, register the tools and they will replace the batteries
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.560]   whenever they go bad. And that's usually the weak link in your tools. So, but the point is you have
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.080]   a generator, now you have the ability to charge batteries. Now you have the ability to have tools.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:20.480]   So when your roof gets blown off, you have a saw that you can still use with a circular saw that
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.960]   runs off of batteries. You have the ability to use your screw guns to go and put your roof back on
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.120]   and cover up a shelter. You have the ability to get a battery operated nail gun if you need it.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:34.880]   You can get battery operated chop saws and table saws. I mean, the sky's the limit. So think about
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.240]   how you create shelter for yourself. Similar things with things like emergency preparedness
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.760]   for showers. If you have a generator, one of the best things you have the ability to do is to run
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.880]   an immersion heater. And so you can get an immersion heater, put it in a bucket of water,
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.240]   warm up some cold water to warm water, and then use a little battery operated shower to dunk the
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.520]   little pump in there and turn the pump on. And now you and your family can have a shower, even if the
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:06.080]   power's out. And all of that is predicated based upon having electrical power. Now you can do it
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:12.960]   other ways. We've bathed our children tons of times in buckets or those bins, the big plastic
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.800]   bins, rubber made bins. And now the common ones are the black ones with the yellow tops.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.800]   And that works out well. Maybe you keep aside a camp stove that runs off of propane,
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.440]   and you can heat up a big bucket of water, put it in the water, and then add some other water,
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.280]   and you can bathe in that. You can pour it over your head. So there's lots of ways to do it.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   Just think about how you would do it. Now let me circle back to food and water,
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:41.840]   and I hope that this is clear enough. As you start to expand, first, you think about it,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.480]   you study it. And then as you start to expand your options, you'll probably go through different
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.000]   phases of types of foods that make sense. If you're thinking about preparing for a hurricane,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.920]   it makes all the sense in the world for you to have canned tuna and saltine crackers in your
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.560]   pantry. It makes all the sense in the world for you to have Campbell's tomato soup or whatever,
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.360]   just the normal things that you buy that are shelf stable. But when you start to go to a longer term
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:18.640]   plan, where you think, "What if I had to do without power for a year? How would I do things?
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.320]   I have no refrigeration for a year. I'm going to run out of fuel for a year. How would I do it then?"
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.760]   You start to move into a different sphere. And you just have to think about, "Am I the kind of
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.240]   person who wants to save money, do it on the cheap?" In that case, you're buying wheat by the
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:39.200]   50-pound bag. You are packing it yourself in a Mylar bag in a bucket with dry ice to get the
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.280]   bug out and oxygen O2 absorbers and all that. Or you can go down to Costco and buy a pallet of
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.960]   freeze-dried food. There's no right or wrong. And in fact, the freeze-dried food options that are
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:56.080]   available are really incredible. I would recommend looking to Meals in a Jar. One of the coolest
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.080]   things that people are doing with freeze-dried food, there was a, I think her name is Chef Tess,
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.480]   but I'm not sure about that. But she wrote a whole cookbook about Meals in a Jar. And so,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:12.080]   you can use all these freeze-dried food options to be able to make whole meals that are ready to go
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:16.400]   in a jar just to add water. And this opens up, this is the kind of thing that you could use even
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.480]   just things like your family vacations. If you try to be frugal with your food when you go on
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.000]   family vacations, it can be frustrating and annoying because you may not have any time to
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.800]   cook, but you don't want to eat out at a restaurant. You can prepare your meals in a jar with all your
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.560]   freeze-dried food. It's totally shelf-stable. It's just sitting there. You can go for years. So,
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.200]   you can take a bunch of these with you. And then when you are ready to, when you're on the road
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.160]   and you think, "Okay, I want to have a hot lunch or a hot dinner ready when we get to our
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.560]   destination," you just simply heat up water. I've talked about that in a show I did on cooking on
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.360]   the road. Make sure that you always travel with the ability to at least heat water. Simple butane
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.280]   stove, 20 bucks at Walmart, canister of butane, works great. You can use an instant pot. Lots of
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.000]   ways that you can heat water. Immersion heater works fine too. So, but you heat up water. You
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.400]   add the boiling water to the can and make sure you put it in an insulated cooler or maybe you use a
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.960]   thermal cooker or something like that. Then leave it there. It rehydrates. It cooks the food. And
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.880]   then when you get to your destination, you've got a hot meal ready to go. It's really, really
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.760]   wonderful. Now, I can't tell you what to do. What I would say is that most people probably in time
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.640]   will put to use all these different techniques. If you're serious and committed to preparedness,
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.120]   you're going to use all of these different techniques. You can't have enough food to
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   feed your neighbors by putting aside cans of tuna fish and saltine crackers. But you can have enough
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:44.080]   food to get yourself through a week without power by just simply deepening your pantry
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.720]   and then using freezers, of course. The other thing I would say is that the reason why a generator is
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.920]   important is because some of the easiest food storage methodologies involve your freezer.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.520]   And so if you can have a big deep freezer that's full of food and you can make sure that that
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.440]   freezer is not going to get warm so you have a backup power source. Now, you can get a freezer
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.760]   that runs on propane itself. That may be a good idea. Or just simply make sure that you have a
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.960]   generator or yeah, a generator is the best. And you have an extended ability to do that, then that's
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.040]   one of your simplest ways. Just have frozen food. It'll last for a long time if you can keep it cold.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.560]   But you can fill up your freezers and that can get you through weeks and weeks if you just simply use
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:30.080]   frozen food. You can can food yourself. I've done it. We have a big pressure canner and I've canned
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.920]   a bunch of stuff. I like to can meat. You buy, go to the food restaurant supply store, buy a giant
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.840]   50-pound box of chicken and then can the chicken, can the beef, etc. It's a lot cheaper than buying
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.720]   it and it's really useful just to have and it lasts for decades. So you can can food yourself.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.800]   And you can can vegetables if you have a source of vegetables as well, either to buy them in bulk at
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.720]   the farmer's market or grow them yourself. Canning I'd say is cost a lot. It takes a lot of time and
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.440]   it costs a lot to get the infrastructure to buy a good pressure canner, to buy if you don't have a
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.720]   stove that will work with it already, to buy all of the jars, etc. But it's certainly a wonderful
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.240]   model. And so you'll probably do some of that yourself. It makes a lot of sense for everybody
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.360]   to have some freeze-dried foods, especially if you have the ability to turn them into meals like
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.240]   the meals in a jar concept. But those freeze-dried foods can add up. They can be more expensive,
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.400]   although when you actually do the cost calculations, they're pretty good. It's just that they
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:31.440]   feel more expensive when you're paying massive money for a number 10 can. It makes a lot of
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:37.520]   sense to have some MREs, meals ready to eat. They're not that expensive. And one of the things
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.640]   I like about meals ready to eat is that they're not very healthy, but they are really calorie rich.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:49.600]   But many times having MREs in the car will allow you to avoid having to make a stop at restaurant
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.080]   food, etc. And so just it's a useful thing because they're packed and they're ready to go at all
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:01.040]   times and they taste okay. Then it's useful to have those set up as a backup. And then when you
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.520]   start to get to the bulk storage and you think about how do I get my family through a year or
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.240]   multiple years, and more importantly, how do I get my extended family through? Because I've got,
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.640]   you know, this big extended family or my neighbors. That's when you really get to the bulk storage
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.680]   options. How do I have buckets and buckets of food and wheat and corn? And then you can kind
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.160]   of level up to there. But I've given you a lot of words and I don't know that I've given you an
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:33.920]   exact answer. So I'll point you in simply this direction. Start by simply thinking yourself
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:40.240]   about what you would need. And I want people desperately to stay practical. It is certainly
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:49.680]   true that maybe you have to go five years. Maybe there's World War III and for years you can't,
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.840]   I don't know, that's even that, I can't even believe that. But maybe there's a global flu
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.520]   pandemic and you got to stay quarantined for six months or a year. Like that stuff happens.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.120]   But the vast majority of disasters are hurricanes, ice storms, and they're solved in a week,
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.960]   couple weeks, etc. So just start by preparing for that and that will put you far ahead of everything
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.800]   else and you won't wind up making a $10,000 MRE purchase and then find out you don't like the
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.320]   MREs. So go slow and you put together the plans based upon your situation, based upon the food
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:26.800]   that you eat and the things that you like. I will commend to you a book, the best book that I think
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:33.440]   people should start with on this space would be Tess Pennington's book on introductory prepping.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.680]   It's called The Prepper's Blueprint, the step-by-step guide to help you prepare for any
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.680]   disaster. I think that's a pretty good one and it goes through the basics and she starts you with
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.320]   two weeks of food and water and then tools and emergency medical supplies and emergency
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   communication and pet preparedness, then 72-hour bags, then evacuation, home security, emergency
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.720]   sanitation, emergency medical supplies, dental preparedness, and she goes deep, deep, deep all
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.200]   the way in, then you move up to one month supply of food little by little and then you move on to
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.320]   even longer term stuff little by little. So I would commend that to you to be a good place to
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:16.400]   start. I think it's a very practical book, it's a well-done book, lots of useful suggestions. I
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.360]   don't think you'd go wrong if you haven't read Tess Pennington's The Prepper's Blueprint, I would
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:27.760]   recommend that you start there. The key is to study, learn, and then customize things to your
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:35.040]   situation. I work from home, thus I don't have a get-home bag, but if I worked in the city and my
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.800]   family were in the suburbs, I'd have a get-home bag at my office, I'd make sure I always had a
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.440]   bicycle, for example, and the simplest things that can do if you work far from home, one of the
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.160]   simplest and best things that you could do is buy yourself a fold-up bicycle and keep a fold-up
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.640]   bicycle in the trunk of your car or stashed somewhere at work, etc. so that if you ever
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.440]   needed to get home and the roads were full or fuel were scarce or something like that,
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.080]   you have the ability to get on a bicycle and get yourself home much faster. I mean, that's the
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:09.360]   biggest fear as a father, that's the biggest fear I have is if I'm separated from my family and can't
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.920]   get home. But simple things like having cash, cash solves the problems. Whenever I travel,
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.960]   I make sure that I have enough cash to get home from wherever I wind up being, even if my credit
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.480]   cards didn't work and even if I, you know, something happened because I need to get, I need
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.680]   to take care of my family. So your situation is different if you live in the city, if you live
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.280]   in the country, if you work in the city, if you work at home, if you live in the north, if you
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:41.920]   live in the south, so you will have to adjust things even to your space and adjusting to your
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.880]   threats that you're concerned about. And I think that you have to consider your budget and
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:53.840]   prioritize things. If I lived in Kansas, I would spend a couple hundred dollars on food and water
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.160]   and then I would install a tornado shelter if my house didn't have one, just because to me that is
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.880]   a much more fearful threat than somehow running out of food. The chances of needing more than a
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:10.560]   couple weeks of food is minimal compared to the risk of not having a safe shelter to go through,
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.000]   to go to a nice tornado shelter that I can get my family into to prepare for that. Now that's
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.520]   different than the risk of tornadoes in Florida and that's different than Minnesota. So adjust
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.760]   to your things and then just simply allow your budget to grow from there. I hope that was in
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.320]   some way helpful. I commend you for asking the questions. There's no excuse for any of us not to
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.600]   be able to at any time be able to take care of ourselves and take care of those that we're
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.440]   responsible for for minimum a few weeks or a month. It's too simple to ignore. It's irresponsible to
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.320]   ignore. Thank you for listening to today's show. Thank you for the questions. If you'd like to

[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.400]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance. Next week I will be talking with you about...
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:07.040]   It's not good to do an ad and then you forget what you're talking about. Recession.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.480]   We're going to talk about preparing for the coming recession, how to prepare for recession, and
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:19.120]   certainly prepping is a component of that. Prepping is a component of that. You'll find many stories.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.520]   I found after the 2008 recessions, I started studying and looking into it and I found several
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.760]   stories of Mormon families who talked about how having their year of food storage saved them when
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.640]   they lost their jobs and it really makes a big difference. When you have the ability, when you
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:42.320]   have a year of food set aside, which is simple to get to. If you don't want to buy Tess Pennington's
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.520]   book, just download the LDS Preparedness Manual and do what they do. Go to the LDS cannery and
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.760]   can your foods. It's all there. The LDS church has done a wonderful job of preparing those things for
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.840]   you. But if you have a year of food supply, that's a year that you could go without buying food if
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:05.680]   you lost your job in a recession. So it really, really has a strong, strong... I mean there's no
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.080]   downside. As long as you can work out the storage space and do it intelligently, there's no downside
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:16.160]   whatsoever. Very, very important. Check out those episodes I talked about and get together.
