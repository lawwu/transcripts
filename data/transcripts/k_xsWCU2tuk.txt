[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.320]   Vince writes in to ask this, hello Pastor John,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm a farmer here in Indiana,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.160]   and I have greatly enjoyed your app
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.880]   while I put in long hours in bringing in the harvest.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.480]   That's wonderful to hear.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.760]   Would you comment on Paul's encouragement
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.000]   that New Testament churches greet one another
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.880]   with a holy kiss?
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.880]   See Romans 16.16, 1 Corinthians 16.20,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040]   2 Corinthians 13.12, and 1 Thessalonians 5.26.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.760]   It may have been a cultural practice of the day,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.600]   but even if the practice has passed away,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680]   is there any contemporary relevance for us today
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.700]   to take out of it?
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.360]   So yes, Paul four times tells the church,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.320]   the Romans, Corinthians, Thessalonians
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   to greet one another with a holy kiss.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.060]   And Peter says to greet one another with kiss of love.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.120]   And I would say that has at least three implications for us.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.560]   First, let's do it.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.640]   I mean, even if the hug and the handshake today
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   in my culture, more common among Christians in the West,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.240]   as I know them, at least it seems to me
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.760]   that we don't have to be resistant to learning something
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.040]   from other cultures and places and times.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.560]   We might do well to broaden
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380]   our possible expressions of affection.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.240]   It doesn't seem to me that Paul and Peter tell the church
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960]   to greet one another with a holy kiss,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.920]   meaning you dare not even see one another
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980]   without kissing one another.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.880]   It's not that kind of rule.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.000]   You know, like if you walk out of this room
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.200]   while we're having tea and you walk back into the room,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.920]   I need to greet you with a kiss.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   Or if I see you between classes at nine, I need to kiss you.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.760]   And if I see you after that class
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   as we're walking down the hall, I need to kiss you again.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.360]   Paul and Peter were not prescribing that kind of precision.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   They were saying, take the physical, familial expression
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.660]   of endearment and use it in a way that is holy
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.500]   to express your love for one another.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.700]   And he didn't prescribe that it had to be done
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.500]   every single time you see one another fresh
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.420]   for the full time.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.180]   He just said, use it, use it, do it.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.060]   And I think that we would do well to think of ways
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.340]   that we might include a holy kiss in our greetings,
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.180]   especially perhaps for very dear friends
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.620]   after very long absences.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.060]   And I'm mainly thinking of people of the same sex here
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.780]   because I think you have to be so careful
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.780]   with kissing people of the opposite sex.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.980]   There are two men in my life who kiss me when I see them.
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.180]   I don't see them, but once, twice a year sometimes.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.660]   And they kiss me on the cheek
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.620]   after these months of separation.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.580]   Only two, there used to be three.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.980]   And now my father is in heaven, and so there's only two.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.180]   And frankly, it means a great deal to me
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.700]   that these brothers put a kiss on my cheek.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.500]   Both of them are manly, thoughtful, self-controlled guys.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   It means one thing, you, John Piper, are precious to me.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.420]   I value our friendship very highly,
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.740]   though we don't see each other very often.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.220]   That's what it means.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.980]   Number two, that's the first implication.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.740]   Just let's do it in appropriate ways.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.980]   Number two, the point that Paul and Peter are making
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.580]   is to stress that the ordinary kiss,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.540]   and it is just an ordinary kiss,
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.800]   should be made holy by the Christian church
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.880]   rather than being abandoned.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.500]   So there's a lesson here for us.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.660]   He says a holy kiss, kiss each other with a holy kiss.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.380]   Kissing is not uniquely Christian.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.420]   It's not a uniquely Christian affection.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.180]   And what the apostles do is say,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.340]   take it from the world and sanctify it.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.940]   Make it holy.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.900]   Devote it to God.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.140]   Make it say something about the Holy One.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.500]   Include God in your hearts and in your thoughts
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.300]   when you greet one another with this ordinary,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.000]   culturally common greeting.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   It seems to me similar to 1 Timothy 2.8
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.440]   where Paul says that he wants the men
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.820]   to pray lifting holy hands.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.400]   I think the main point there is not that everywhere
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.000]   and at all times in the church where there's prayer,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.560]   the men must have their hands in the air.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.260]   Surely there are times when other postures
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.480]   would also be appropriate.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.200]   The point is when you lift your hands,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.220]   they should be holy hands in prayer.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.220]   So when the kiss of affection is given to a brother
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.640]   in Christ, it should not be sensual or manipulative
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   or offensive or hypocritical or in any way,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.960]   pretending to express affection that's not really there.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.640]   It shouldn't hide any sin in our lives.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.820]   It should be a holy kiss.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.960]   So the lesson we can learn here is that whatever means,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.160]   whatever means of expressing greetings,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.260]   I mean, right now, what do you do?
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.380]   Ball up your fist and hit somebody's knuckles.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.540]   Where'd that come from?
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.060]   So I think what the apostles want to do
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.060]   is encourage us to use various culturally appropriate
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.920]   symbols of greeting and sanctify them and make them holy.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.760]   What do we do?
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.760]   We ball up our fists and we do fist bumps with each other.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.880]   I hardly ever know what to do.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.240]   Somebody makes a fist at me and says,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.600]   "Oh yeah, I'm supposed to punch you on the fist."
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.520]   What is that?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.220]   I don't know where that comes from or what that is,
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.880]   but I do it and I think Paul would look at that
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.400]   and he would say, "I encourage all of you guys."
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.680]   I don't know whether women do this or not,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.820]   "I encourage all of you guys to fist bump
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.980]   "with a holy fist bump."
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.020]   That's what he's getting at.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.380]   Take the culturally appropriate means of showing brotherhood
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.660]   or camaraderie or affection and make them holy.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.020]   That's the gist here, so that's the second thing.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.020]   And the third thing is, I suspect this is the main point,
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.280]   namely that Christians should feel genuine affection
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.000]   for one another.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.340]   I've been reading 1 Peter a lot lately
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.180]   and really been impressed 'cause I'm teaching it
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.440]   to the seminary guys, and it seems to me
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.820]   that Peter is writing to a persecuted, beleaguered church,
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.620]   trying to encourage them how to live as exiles
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.220]   in a vast sea of unbelievers
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.920]   who are being very hostile to them,
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   and he's laboring to help them not just show dutiful,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.540]   sacrificial love to each other, but rather to feel earnest,
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.080]   heartfelt affection to one another.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.220]   I think that's why he says at the end,
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.620]   "Kiss one another with the kiss of love."
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.280]   So 1 Peter 1.22, "Having purified your souls
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.520]   "by obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.480]   "love one another earnestly from a pure heart."
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   So those words are so beyond treat each other nice,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.140]   way beyond treating.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.500]   He is calling for Christians to really have changes of heart
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.320]   so that when we approach another Christian,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.820]   our hearts are drawn out in words like this.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.200]   This is 1 Peter 3.8, "Have unity of mind,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   "sympathy, brotherly love, tenderness of heart,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.620]   "humble mind."
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.820]   I mean, three of those, sympathy, brotherly love,
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.780]   tender heart, imply how warm and tender and gentle
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.700]   and kind and affectionate we should be
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.100]   towards brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.460]   Those are amazing words,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.580]   and that's what Peter wants to see happen,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.120]   and I think that's really what's behind both Peter and Paul
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   saying that we should use a holy kiss.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.540]   He wants us to be demonstrative in real affections,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.540]   and that's what we should seek to grow in.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.580]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.500]   Fist bump with a holy fist bump.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.020]   That's outstanding.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.860]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.360]   like Vince did today.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.520]   Well, speaking of online,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.680]   I bet most of us know the thrill of going online
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.240]   and ordering things for ourselves
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.200]   that arrive at our homes within days, maybe hours.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.720]   We're living in a golden age of online shopping conveniences
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.080]   and it can also become an addiction in our lives,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.840]   and a listener wants to know
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.000]   if she is addicted to online shopping
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.840]   and what to do about it.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   She asked for John Piper's help tomorrow.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.880]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.360]   (silence)
