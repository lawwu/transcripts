[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.320]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.560]   My guest today is Morgan Hausel.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.840]   Morgan Hausel is a partner at the Collaborative Fund
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.920]   and an expert in private wealth generation and management.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.220]   He is also the author
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.200]   of the spectacularly best-selling book,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.920]   "The Psychology of Money."
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.520]   And today we talk about the psychology of money.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.240]   We talk about how money can change your psychology.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.960]   We talk about how most people tend to lie at the extremes
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.400]   of either saving too much money or spending too much money.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.780]   And we talk about how most people get it completely wrong
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.720]   when it comes to framing in our minds what money is,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.160]   what its real value is,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.960]   and its ability to generate happiness within us.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.640]   And no, I am not going to tell you,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.440]   and Morgan is not going to tell you,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.980]   that beyond a certain dollar amount,
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.360]   you don't increase your happiness.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.120]   Because as we all know, money cannot buy happiness,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.520]   but it can buffer stress.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160]   We acknowledge that from the outset.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.080]   And then Morgan goes on to explain
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.360]   that really what we're seeking
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.500]   when we talk about seeking wealth or money is freedom.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.960]   Freedom is really about independence.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560]   And that if we are constantly in pursuit of wealth,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.600]   well, then we are not truly free or independent.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.280]   So today's discussion is as much about being happy,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.640]   being free, feeling independent, feeling free of stress,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.680]   as it is about this thing that we call money.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.260]   So in other words, Morgan explains not just how to generate
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.240]   and manage monetary wealth, he explains that,
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.920]   but he also explains how to organize your life
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.260]   in and around this thing that we call career,
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.880]   the pursuit of wealth, and happiness.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.000]   And I can think of few topics as important
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.160]   as today's topic.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.140]   I read Morgan's book, "The Psychology of Money,"
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.060]   and I loved it.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.880]   I also loved today's discussion
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.920]   because I'm certain that after it's done,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.380]   you will realize that you've probably been thinking
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.880]   about wealth and money incorrectly in a number of ways,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.160]   and you've probably been pursuing it incorrectly
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.000]   in a number of ways.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.980]   But by asking yourself certain probe questions
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.060]   that Morgan raises today and answering those questions,
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.880]   you can arrive in a place where your relationship to money
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.900]   and your pursuit of it really clearly matches
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.600]   your particular goals.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.200]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.320]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.360]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.760]   to the general public.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.880]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.820]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.560]   Our first sponsor is Wealthfront.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.480]   I've been using Wealthfront for nearly a decade
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.340]   as my high-yield cash account, and I absolutely love it.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.680]   Personally, I'm sometimes hesitant to invest money
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.820]   given the risks involved,
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.580]   so I often prefer to keep it in my Wealthfront cash account
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.660]   where I'm able to earn 4.25% annual percentage yield
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.720]   on my deposits, and you can as well.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.180]   With Wealthfront, you can earn 4.25% APY on your cash
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.780]   through partner banks until you're ready
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.940]   to either spend that money or invest it.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.460]   With Wealthfront, you also get free same-day withdrawals
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.180]   to eligible accounts every day,
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.860]   even on weekends and holidays.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.080]   The 4.25% APY is not a promotional rate.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.420]   There's no limit to what you can deposit and earn,
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.560]   and you can even get protection of up to $8 million
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.060]   through FDIC insurance
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.180]   provided through Wealthfront's partner banks.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.300]   For same-day withdrawals, just start your withdrawal
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.140]   as late as 9 p.m. Eastern
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.500]   to one of over 550 eligible banks and credit unions
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.800]   to get it the same day.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.140]   And it takes just a few minutes to transfer your cash
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.300]   from the cash account
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.980]   to any of Wealthfront's automated investing accounts
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.840]   when you're ready.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.600]   There are already over a million people using Wealthfront
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.500]   to save more, earn more, and build long-term wealth.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.780]   Earn 4.25% APY on your cash today.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.220]   If you'd like to try Wealthfront,
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.980]   go to wealthfront.com/huberman

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.480]   This has been a paid testimonial of Wealthfront.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.100]   Wealthfront brokerage isn't a bank.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.860]   The APY is subject to change.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.400]   For more information, see the episode description.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.300]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.320]   Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.000]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.620]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.700]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.780]   that therapy is an extremely important component
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.880]   to overall health.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.300]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.020]   that great therapy provides.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.360]   First of all, it provides good rapport with somebody
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.860]   that you can trust and talk to
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.820]   about any and all issues you want to.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.620]   Second of all, it can provide support
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.380]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.460]   And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.140]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.620]   for you to find an expert therapist who you resonate with
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.260]   and can provide you those benefits
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.060]   that come through expert therapy.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.140]   Also, because BetterHelp allows for therapy
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.360]   to be done entirely online, it's very time efficient.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.540]   It's very easy to fit into a busy schedule
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.460]   with no commuting to your therapist's office
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.580]   or sitting in a waiting room or looking for parking.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.420]   None of that.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.800]   It's all done online.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.580]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.360]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.300]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.900]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.840]   And now for my discussion with Morgan Housel.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.260]   Morgan Housel, welcome.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.100]   - Thanks so much for having me.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100]   Happy to be here.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.180]   - I'm excited that you have a new book coming out next year
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.320]   about the art of spending money.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.160]   Is that right?
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960]   - That's right, you got it.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.580]   - Today, I want to talk about how to think about money.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.920]   What is it?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.640]   How do we frame it within our historical context,
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.080]   meaning our personal historical context?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.000]   Because I think we all and each think about money
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.800]   a little bit differently.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   And then talk about what is the best use,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.600]   or in some cases, not use of money?
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360]   This is a topic that could go
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.720]   in any number of different directions,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.680]   but my goal here is that people will get
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.860]   a better understanding of what money is,
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.940]   why they work for it,
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.940]   and really how to make it a true asset to their lives,
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.060]   as opposed to something that is forever out of reach
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.380]   in terms of amount or what they expected to bring them.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.780]   - Great, looking forward to it.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.620]   - Great.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.860]   - So your book starts off with this notion
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.180]   that people are not crazy.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.260]   It's in fact the title of the chapter.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260]   Does that mean that people are rational about money?
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.480]   - Oh, I think it's very different.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.980]   What I meant by no one is crazy is that it is so easy
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.220]   for people to look around at society
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.060]   and how other people are spending their money
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.980]   and saving their money and investing their money
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.380]   and say, why the hell would anybody do that?
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.740]   Why would you waste your money on this?
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.260]   Why would you hoard your money like that?
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.820]   And I actually think if you peel back the onion layer
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.900]   of what's going on in those people's lives,
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.460]   no one is really that crazy with how they spend their money
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.300]   or save their money.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.540]   It makes sense to them in that moment.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.420]   My brother-in-law is a social worker.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.260]   He works with very disadvantaged kids,
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.300]   kids who are abused at home, who don't have homes.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.740]   And a lot of those kids, not surprisingly,
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.140]   do very poorly at school.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.900]   They misbehave, they get in fights, they don't go to school.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.020]   And it is so common for those kids
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.220]   that the teacher will look at those kids and say,
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.900]   why are you acting like this?
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.060]   Why don't you do the right thing?
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.480]   It's so obvious.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.020]   And he says, there's a phrase in social work,
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.620]   all behavior makes sense with enough information.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.220]   That if you look at what those kids are dealing with in life,
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.300]   it would all make sense to you
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.940]   why they are misbehaving at school.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.580]   And I think that's a powerful idea
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.660]   for a lot of things in life,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.060]   that all behavior makes sense with enough information.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.140]   And you can really apply it to money too.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.500]   That you could easily tie how I spend my money today
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.820]   and save my money today
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.620]   based off of the experience that I've had in life,
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.500]   how I was raised, where I was raised,
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.100]   how old I am, the generation I was born into.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.000]   All things that are outside of my control.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.740]   And it is very common to look at people
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.340]   who are spending a ton of money.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.780]   Well, there's a story behind that.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.220]   They're spending a ton of money because they want some,
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.060]   for a lot of them, they want some sort of attention.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.820]   They're trying to get people's attention.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.620]   Maybe sometimes they're trying to cover up a hole,
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.540]   maybe they actually are really enjoying it.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.900]   People who are hoarding a lot of money.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.100]   There's a story there too.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.300]   They experience something that's causing them to do that.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.760]   And I think that this is really important for two reasons.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.020]   One, it forces you to realize
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.540]   that there is not one right way to manage money,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.580]   to save it, to spend it.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.020]   You gotta figure out what works for you.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.300]   And what works for me might not work for you.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.780]   There's not one answer.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.100]   And it's not like math.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.900]   Like in math, two plus two equals four for everybody.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.740]   And in money, it's like,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.160]   you gotta figure it out for yourself.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.700]   It's almost like your taste in food or your taste in music.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.520]   Like, just find out what you like and do that.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.380]   The other thing is I think you become less cynical
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.140]   about other people's decisions.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.020]   And you don't spend all your day saying,
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.540]   look at that idiot spending their money in a stupid way.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.980]   No, it's just, you gotta figure it out for yourself.
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.940]   And I think you become happier
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.980]   when you're a little less cynical
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.540]   about how other people are doing it.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.180]   - For most people, including myself,
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.260]   the whole notion of money and safety
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.740]   are very closely linked.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.900]   Do we have enough resources to take care of ourselves
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.340]   plus a bit extra, one hopes.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.060]   I guess I would include in taking care of oneself,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.940]   buffering one's anxiety about not having enough money.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.120]   That's part of the psychological care.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.860]   And also taking care of others
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.380]   that we might be responsible for,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.640]   or simply want to take care of.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.560]   That's very closely linked to notions of how much
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.780]   and what type of education to get, right?
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.220]   I mean, I think everyone presumably at some point
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.540]   goes through the mental gymnastics
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.660]   of is it worth it to get an advanced degree?
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.380]   What major should I focus on?
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.100]   Is that, are there any jobs there?
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.700]   When I went to school to be a neuroscientist,
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.060]   a cardiologist, a friend of our family said,
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.180]   why would you go into neuroscience?
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.780]   There are no jobs in that.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.300]   There were plenty of jobs in neuroscience
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.420]   and still are.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.880]   I wouldn't say that most of them are high paying jobs.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.020]   So, you know, we know that higher education
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.020]   doesn't always scale with higher income.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.800]   As we grow up and move into the world,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.380]   you know, we're thinking about how to integrate
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.220]   all these different things,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.400]   what we want to do because it's interesting
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.320]   versus what will make us money.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.940]   In your experience and observation,
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.500]   and in writing your book,
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.860]   is there some sort of mental path
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.300]   to cut through these different considerations?
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.760]   I mean, when we talk about money and wealth,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.780]   you know, what should we really take into consideration?
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.220]   Is there some sort of checklist?
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.500]   I mean, it becomes a pretty vast space.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.860]   I believe that you get the best work out of yourself
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.340]   in terms of going after things
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.740]   that you're really interested in.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.660]   But, you know, there may not be money
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.000]   in things that are highly interesting to somebody.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.180]   - I asked Daniel Kahneman a very similar question
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.100]   about 10 years ago.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.580]   Kahneman is a world renowned psychologist,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.940]   won the Nobel prize in economics,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.700]   passed away a year or two ago.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.780]   And he said the trait that you need
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.380]   to do well with money over time,
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.740]   no matter who you are,
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.400]   is a well calibrated sense of your future regret.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.340]   What are you going to end up regretting in the past?
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.980]   I think at the highest level,
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.180]   that's how you should base all of your financial decisions
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.820]   is will I regret spending this or not spending this?
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.500]   Will I regret making or not making this investment?
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.360]   Now, much easier said than done.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.780]   I think most people do not fully understand
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.140]   their own sense of regret,
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.700]   what they're likely to look back and say,
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.980]   I wish I had not have done this.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.380]   The other thing is that it changes
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.580]   over the course of your life.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.220]   I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.720]   I'm a big saver, have been for my entire adult life.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.420]   Heaven forbid, if I were on my deathbed tomorrow,
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.380]   would I regret the vacations I didn't take,
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.900]   the cars I didn't buy?
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.580]   The answer right now is absolutely not.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.460]   I would feel so good knowing
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.740]   that my wife and kids are going to be okay.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.620]   So I would take so much pleasure in knowing
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.520]   that I did not spend that money.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.700]   I saved it for their protection.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.060]   Will I still feel that way if I'm 80 years old?
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.860]   Then maybe I will look back and say,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.400]   I should have lived a little bit more.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.100]   I should have given my money away
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.340]   while I could have seen it being given away.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.200]   So it changes throughout the course of your life.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.440]   But I think if you're always thinking through the lens
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.420]   of what am I gonna regret?
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.060]   It's never about YOLO or about like,
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.860]   oh, save today so you can have it for tomorrow.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.440]   I think that's too simple to think about it.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.660]   You have to know what you're gonna regret in the future
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.500]   and look back.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.300]   And back to everyone's different.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.840]   What I will regret might be very different
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.100]   from what you will regret.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.840]   Very interesting story from Jeff Bezos.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.340]   He talked about when he started Amazon back
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.440]   in I think it was 1994.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.380]   The reason he started it,
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.180]   and he knew that there was very little chance
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.100]   it was gonna work when he first started it.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.780]   But he said, if I do not try this, I will regret it.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.520]   And if I try it and it fails, I won't regret that.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.580]   That's an amazing story
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.340]   that talks about his entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.700]   The other thing, when I first heard that story is,
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.780]   bless him for thinking that,
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.340]   I do not have that personality.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.820]   If I devoted my entire life and my family's money
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.140]   and my parents' money to a startup and it failed,
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.860]   I might regret that.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.580]   I admire and I'm grateful for the people
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.820]   who do not have that vision, as he does,
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.940]   made the world better.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.420]   But everyone's sense of regret
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.660]   is gonna be a little bit different.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.660]   - And sometimes this sense of what one is likely to regret,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.900]   if we have access to it at all,
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.700]   'cause it sounds like we're not very good at anticipating
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.200]   this, as Kahneman pointed out.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.300]   Most people lack a well-calibrated sense of future regret.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.460]   That's gonna change over time, so it's dynamic.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.820]   And here we're talking about investing
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.260]   in two-year or four-year degrees.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.020]   We're talking about investing in one's time,
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.460]   that is, in a particular profession.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.140]   And I think we come up with all these explanations
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:24.280]   post hoc about, well, I went to that company,
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.420]   I went into that line of work,
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.580]   I spent 10 years there or the startup failed,
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.580]   but I learned a valuable lesson that then
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.620]   really supported me in a future endeavor.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.780]   And so we rationalize our poor choices from the past
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.300]   in ways that allow us to connect the dots
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.440]   to sort of steal from the famous Steve Jobs speech.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.460]   And yet all of this really says that we are very poor
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.340]   at placing our current experience and our past experience
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.780]   into any kind of future projection of ourselves.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.420]   - You talk a little bit about this in your book,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.620]   and this really sunk in for me in a major way,
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.620]   that we don't really know or anticipate
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.060]   how we are likely to change as we get older.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.400]   - Right, so there's a thing in psychology
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.680]   called the end of history illusion,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.840]   which means that you are very aware
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.160]   of how much you've changed in the last 20 years.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.980]   You are maybe smarter, wiser,
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.000]   you have your beliefs about things in life have evolved.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.140]   And that's true for most people.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.500]   But most people, if you actually dig into it,
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.060]   they think if you say,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.260]   who will you be in 20 years from now?
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.100]   They think they'll roughly be
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.580]   the same person they are today.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.980]   It's always this belief that I've grown so much in the past,
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.300]   but I'm done growing.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.980]   'Cause it's hard to project
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.700]   how you're gonna be different in the future.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.100]   A lot of that is if I tell myself 20 years from now,
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.060]   I'll have very different beliefs about politics,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.700]   whatever it might be.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.740]   What I'm effectively admitting
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.440]   is what I believe today is wrong.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.500]   And you don't wanna believe that.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.180]   Everyone wants to wake up and look in the mirror
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.260]   and say, what I believe today is the right thing.
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.920]   It's just like a self-justification of your own beliefs
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.460]   to makes it easier to go about the days.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.260]   What I believe right now is the right thing.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.380]   And maybe you have a little bit of doubt around the edges,
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.980]   but most of it is what I believe is true.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.380]   So you don't wanna believe that you're gonna adjust
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.740]   and adapt those beliefs over time.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.220]   So it becomes difficult to take a truly long-term view
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.940]   and make a decision today
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.380]   that is going to be something
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.060]   that you're not gonna regret in the future.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.900]   As I've always framed this,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.680]   I think the only antidote to this
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.060]   of trying to get around this problem
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.660]   is avoiding the extreme ends of financial planning.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.820]   And a lot of people are on the extreme ends.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.740]   Like on one end, you have the FIRE movement,
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.620]   the people who save 90% of their income
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.260]   and they wanna retire at 28, kind of that kind of thing.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.240]   And on the other hand, you have like the YOLO crypto traders
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.080]   who are like, doesn't matter,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.580]   like just throw it all down and let's see what happens.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.380]   Those extreme ends are what you are most likely to regret
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.860]   at some point in the future.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.460]   And the crypto, look, I think a lot of those people are young
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.460]   and they have time to make up for their mistakes.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.340]   I did a lot of really dumb things with my money
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.300]   in my teens and 20s.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.100]   But I think a lot of them,
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.900]   that's where they are most likely to look back.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.220]   It's one thing to lose a lot of money in your 20s
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.580]   and say, ah, it doesn't really matter.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.580]   But then when you're 48
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.300]   and trying to put your kids through college,
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.400]   that's when you're gonna look back like,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.740]   I wish I hadn't done something like that.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.060]   So those extreme ends are like,
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.020]   have the highest odds of future regret.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.860]   - In order to, as I described it before,
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.180]   carve a path through this for people,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.220]   I'm wondering if people generally fall into
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.500]   either one or the other category of,
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.740]   as you described with Bezos,
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.380]   not wanting to regret not having done something.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.220]   So I think of that in sort of pseudo-neurobiological terms
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.780]   as being drawn toward the possible dopaminergic
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.700]   or other rewards of having succeeded.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.620]   Really, that's what he's envisioning, presumably,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.040]   is the pain of having not had been given himself
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.300]   the opportunity to succeed.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.740]   Okay, that's one way to put it.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.640]   And then the other path would be
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.700]   just avoiding the pain of loss.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.860]   And there are a lot of studies,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.660]   I think Kahneman did some of them, in fact,
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.060]   that people work a lot harder to avoid the pain of loss
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.180]   than to gain something.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.220]   But in thinking about the people I know
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.060]   across various wealth scales and different ages,
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.420]   it seems that some people are just more motivated
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.300]   to try new things because they like doing new things.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.480]   They like the sense of reward
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.180]   that can come from doing those things.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.840]   And so it really is painful for them
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.780]   to stay in the same place, financially or otherwise.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.220]   Other people, they like the sure thing.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.640]   They like reliability.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.500]   And you can see this in a lot of domains of their life.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.880]   I mean, I don't want to extrapolate this
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.360]   to all aspects of their life,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   but some people like dogs that the entire breed
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.220]   is known for rarely ever having bitten somebody.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.060]   Other people like to raise cane corsos.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.040]   And while I'm sure there's some really nice,
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.820]   loving cane corsos out there,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.700]   they occasionally bite it when they bite it serious.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.400]   So, you know, are we really talking about a propensity
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.240]   for risk versus safety?
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.540]   And do you think that people fall
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.800]   into more or less two camps on that?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.360]   - I think it's true that some people would go nuts
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.760]   if they took the safe path.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.440]   And even if they're doing it in the name of like,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.640]   "I don't want to regret this,"
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.720]   but they need some sort of variability in their life.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.320]   They need to go out and do things.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.960]   The other element is we don't know
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.480]   the paths that we didn't take.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.980]   And I'll give you a personal example of this.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.780]   20 years ago, I was enrolled in Pepperdine,
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.620]   but I didn't go.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.460]   I was enrolled in just at the last second I transferred.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.380]   So I never actually attended, but I was all enrolled.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.260]   And of course, I think what would my life have been
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.500]   if I had gone there?
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.540]   'Cause the school that I transferred to, I met my wife,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.020]   started my career there.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.540]   And it's easy for me to say, "God, I'm so glad
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.060]   "I did not go there,"
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.480]   'cause my life would not be what it is today.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.500]   But the truth is, maybe it would have been fine.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   It would have been better.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.060]   You never know the paths that you didn't take,
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.420]   where they're going to end up.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.700]   So back to Conor's point,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.540]   a well-calibrated sense of your future regret,
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.940]   but nobody knows the paths that they didn't take
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.900]   and where those would go.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.780]   So it just makes it very difficult to have any idea
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.420]   of which paths you should be on in that end.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.620]   So I think just avoiding those two camps
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.220]   of the extreme ends of it.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.820]   But again, as I said earlier,
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.260]   I think that is actually more than half of people
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.800]   are on some sort of extreme end
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.340]   of spending way more than they can
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.260]   or saving way more than they need to.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.940]   There's a fat tail distribution
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.420]   in how people manage their money.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.940]   And so that's quite a few people.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.860]   And I think that's why,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.700]   I think it's one of the reasons why we live in a society
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.940]   that is richer than it's ever been by far,
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.820]   not just at the top, but at the median level.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.380]   The average family is richer than they've ever been.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.700]   But because we manage it in such extreme ways,
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.240]   is it making people happier?
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.140]   Are we happier today than we were 40 years ago
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.100]   or 100 years ago?
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.460]   That there's not a ton of evidence for.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.980]   Because managing it in a way
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.900]   that's actually gonna make you happier
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.620]   and reduce your regret and live a more meaningful life
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.180]   is much harder than earning it
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.100]   and accumulating it over time.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.320]   - When I was growing up,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.780]   you would see a mixture of newer cars,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.580]   including some very nice cars,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.300]   as well as a lot of older kind of beaten up cars
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.900]   driving around.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.460]   Nowadays, of course, this varies by area.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.180]   It's actually rare to see really old beat up cars.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.800]   You see some really nice old cars that have been restored,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.340]   but that's a different thing altogether.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.340]   And I assume this is because of credit
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.740]   that people can now buy things on credit.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.020]   How has the ability to purchase things on credit
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.640]   changed the way that we think about money generally?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.380]   I know people who have tremendous credit card debt,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.760]   and I think are now at the point where they figure
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.420]   that they're never gonna pay it off.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.860]   They're just gonna probably not live long enough
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.700]   to pay it off.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.940]   And they're sort of comfortable with that,
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.980]   which is kind of scary to see.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.540]   And some of them aren't even particularly big spenders.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.380]   They just accrued this debt early enough
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.060]   and they can't seem to get out from the trap of that.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.620]   I know other people who, like myself,
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.380]   pay off my credit card bill every month.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.020]   I'm like, I hate the whatever it is, 18 plus percent interest
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.260]   even if I'm one day late.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.980]   I'm like, ah, you know?
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.420]   And at the same time,
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.620]   I'm not somebody who likes to purchase many things.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.820]   I'm not a things guy.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.860]   I own one or two watches, one truck,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.020]   like I'm just not a things guy.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.600]   But I certainly have my own psychological relationship
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.660]   with money that after talking to you today,
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.740]   I'm sure I'm going to realize is not optimized either.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.740]   So it's easy to point fingers
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   at people in these different groups.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.700]   But going back to this issue of credit,
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.460]   how has the ability to own and use things
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.340]   that we don't really truly own
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.380]   basically to exceed our income level
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.900]   in terms of the number and type of luxuries
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.340]   that we can enjoy changed the way
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.040]   that people think about money and use money?
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.820]   Because today's discussion in your book,
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.660]   we're talking about money as if it's something that we have,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.820]   but credit basically is living outside your means.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.660]   - That's a good definition.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.480]   - Yeah.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.900]   - I think the knee-jerk response would be,
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.840]   oh, it helps you pull your consumption forward
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.040]   so you can have more toys
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.220]   that you would not have had in a different era.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.940]   And I actually think for a lot of people, it's the opposite,
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.780]   that there are a lot of people
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.380]   that have holes in their life, challenges in their life.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.540]   And a very easy answer,
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.420]   if you're not happy with your life
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.900]   and you have a hole you're trying to fill is,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.780]   well, if I had more money, this problem would go away.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.980]   And in previous generations, previous decades,
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.780]   you could not just go out and have a ton of more money
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.260]   so you earned your money from your paycheck,
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.500]   that was what you had.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.700]   Today, it makes it easier
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.220]   to try to fill that hole in your life with money.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.860]   And so you can keep on getting more and more and more.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.760]   And for a lot of people, they will wake up and say,
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.540]   oh, if only I had that car, my life would be better.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.900]   And they go buy that car and they still feel the same.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.220]   So then it's like, ah, you know what?
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.760]   If I had that car and that watch, then I'd feel better.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.260]   They get the watch, they feel the same.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.180]   Ah, you know what's missing?
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.180]   The house, I gotta go get that fancy house.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.980]   It's this continuous spiral.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.560]   And since you can finance all of that,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.220]   it makes it easier and easier to go on that spiral.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.520]   Will Smith made this incredible realization
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.440]   I loved from his biography.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.040]   He said when he was poor and depressed,
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.080]   he had hope 'cause he could tell himself,
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.320]   one day I'm gonna have money
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.720]   and all these problems will go away.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.040]   And then when he was rich and depressed,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.160]   he was still depressed and he lost all of his hope
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.260]   'cause he had more money than he could ever spend.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.520]   So he could not tell himself, if only I had more money,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.760]   these problems would go away.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.280]   And so for a lot of people, the availability of credit
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.400]   is giving them, I think, a false sense of hope
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.160]   that's keeping them on this hamster wheel of,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.880]   if only I had this bigger house, this nicer car,
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.760]   all these problems that I wake up with every morning
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.780]   would go away and it keeps you on that path.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.500]   Which I think if you actually don't have access
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.780]   to that much money, you're more likely to wake up and say,
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.620]   what is this hole?
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.840]   I need to fix it in a different way.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.480]   It's health, it's relationships, it's purpose,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.520]   whatever it might be,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.400]   rather than trying to put a bandaid of credit over it.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.480]   - So interesting.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.640]   I sometimes think about the phrase,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.720]   money can't buy happiness.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.000]   And my immediate impulse is to respond with,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.760]   well, somebody with a lot of money probably said that.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.000]   Not because I think money can buy happiness,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.120]   but money can buffer stress.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.940]   I have friends who've had children recently
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.280]   who have night nurses.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.360]   They're looking a lot more rested than the ones that don't
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.440]   because they can't afford them.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.200]   And on and on.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.120]   If you have a medical issue, right?
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.480]   I mean, there's this whole world within hospitals
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.000]   that we won't talk about in this episode,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.240]   but there's this whole world about wealth
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.880]   and how one is actually even treated
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.600]   as a person in a hospital.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.000]   There's a lot of knowledge behind the scenes
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.540]   about people's income level when they come into a hospital.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.120]   People are gonna really go wide-eyed when they hear this.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.080]   They'll get shuttled to different rooms,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.640]   different conditions that allow them to sleep better,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.520]   recover better, health outcomes depend on this.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.380]   I mean, and on and on.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.120]   So money can't buy happiness,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.640]   but it certainly can buffer stress
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.440]   and it can drive outcomes.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.240]   So how should we frame that?
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.600]   Especially if we are on the,
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.120]   or in the pursuit of acquiring more money, more wealth,
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.240]   because a lot of people are.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.000]   - Money absolutely can buy happiness.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.320]   It's often though an indirect path.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.600]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.400]   will a big fancy house make you happier?
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.120]   And the answer is probably yes.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.280]   But the reason it might is because it'll make it more,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.480]   it'll make it easier to host friends and family.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.280]   And that's what's actually making you happy.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.840]   It's those extra connections with those people.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.760]   Does going on a nice vacation make you happy?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.640]   An expensive vacation, yes.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.520]   Because you're gonna form memories with your kids,
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.200]   with your spouse, with your friends while you're there.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.640]   That's what's making you happy.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.740]   So you can't say that money doesn't make people happy.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.640]   It does, it obviously does.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   The other thing that's important
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.320]   is what really makes people happy in their core
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.100]   is some sense of purpose.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.820]   There's a great quote from the movie "Boiler Room"
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.660]   where he says,
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.880]   people who say money doesn't buy happiness don't have any.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.560]   And I think there's a lot of truth to that.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.840]   The people who become richer say,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.000]   of course I was happier now than I was when I was poor.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.960]   Of course, I would never wanna go back there.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.440]   But often what's happening is
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   the reason that you were happier when you were rich
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.040]   is because the reason you got rich
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.440]   is because you found some sort of purpose.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.840]   You built a business, you were successful in your career,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.200]   and that gave you a good sense of purpose and identity.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.580]   And where you see the opposite of that
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.680]   are lottery winners who become rich,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.780]   but not because they made a good investment,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.080]   not because they built a business,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.360]   not because they're successful
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.000]   and their peers like them and whatnot.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.840]   They just got lucky.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.920]   And those are the people,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.560]   so many studies that winning the lottery
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.440]   will not make you happy.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.120]   It might for a very short period of time,
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.960]   but over time it doesn't
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.900]   because you didn't get any added purpose.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.240]   You can't wake up in the morning and say,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.400]   I built this business, I did it, I'm so successful,
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   I got my PhD, I did, there's none of that.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.240]   You just got lucky.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.200]   And so that's not gonna bring you much happiness.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.160]   So money does make you happier.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.440]   I think it can for everybody
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.520]   if you learn how to spend it
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.800]   in your personality and whatnot.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.000]   Spending a lot of it, spending a ton of money
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.840]   can make you happier.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.760]   I think there's almost no limit to it,
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.420]   but it's different for everybody.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.640]   And it's often a roundabout way.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.560]   I think a lot about this when,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.280]   if I go on an expensive vacation with my kids,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.720]   let's say that's a 10, that's a 10 out of 10
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   in terms of just happiness, memories and whatnot.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.920]   But actually what was making me happy
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.040]   was spending uninterrupted time with my kids.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.160]   So staying home and playing Legos
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.340]   on the living room floor with them,
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.140]   that might be like an eight and a half
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.760]   because that's what's making me happy.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.940]   You just have to figure out like the actual purpose.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.640]   I think a good formula for a pretty good life
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.160]   at the simplest level is independence plus purpose.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.640]   You need to have a purpose that is bigger than yourself
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.120]   that you are chasing.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.620]   Family, religion, work, whatever it might be,
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.520]   different for everybody.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.820]   And you need to have the independence
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.500]   to make sure you can do it on your own terms
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.720]   rather than chasing somebody else's goal.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.560]   That's like the highest level of psychological wellbeing,
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.240]   independence and purpose.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.520]   And money is not one of those things,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.160]   but you can easily see how money can help those things.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.640]   Money brings you independence.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.840]   It can allow you to find your purpose in a bigger way.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.060]   You're not chasing, you're not at your boss's whim.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.360]   You can do whatever you want, you're independent.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.960]   So using money as a tool can make you happier.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.560]   Spending money can make you happier,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.600]   but it's not the thing that is making you happier.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.560]   It's just a tool to do other things
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.920]   and acquire other things that are actually making you happy.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.160]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.800]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.400]   By now, many of you have heard me say
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.160]   that if I could take just one supplement,
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.240]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.760]   The reason for that is AG1 is the highest quality
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.680]   and most complete
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.420]   of the foundational nutritional supplements available.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.860]   What that means is that it contains
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.220]   not just vitamins and minerals,
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.620]   but also probiotics, prebiotics and adaptogens
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.040]   to cover any gaps you may have in your diet
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.320]   and provide support for a demanding life.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.180]   For me, even if I eat mostly whole foods
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.380]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.320]   which I do for most of my food intake,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.300]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.140]   and vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.180]   micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.660]   For that reason, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.060]   When I do that, it clearly bolsters my energy,
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.640]   my immune system and my gut microbiome.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.480]   These are all critical to brain function,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.060]   mood, physical performance and much more.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.520]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.640]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.220]   to claim their special offer.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.360]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.220]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.840]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.600]   to claim that special offer.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.680]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.840]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   I'm excited to share that Roka and I have teamed up
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.960]   to create a new style of red lens glasses.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.440]   These red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.920]   after the sun goes down.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.640]   They filter out short wavelength light
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.060]   that comes from screens and from LED lights,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.520]   the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.440]   as overhead and frankly, lamp lighting nowadays.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.800]   I wanna emphasize Roka red lens glasses
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.680]   are not traditional blue blockers.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.840]   They're not designed to be worn during the day
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.540]   and to filter out blue light from screen light.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.340]   They're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.500]   that suppress melatonin secretion at night
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.140]   and that can alter your sleep.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.600]   So by wearing Roka red lens glasses,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.180]   they help you calm down
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.420]   and they improve your transition to sleep.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.420]   Most nights I stay up until about 10 p.m. or even midnight
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.140]   and I wake up between five and 7 a.m.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.020]   depending on when I went to sleep.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.060]   Now I put my Roka red lens glasses on
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.900]   as soon as it gets dark outside
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.620]   and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.360]   which makes sense based on everything we know
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.720]   about how filtering out short wavelength of light
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.000]   can allow your brain to function correctly.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.600]   Roka red lens glasses also look cool, frankly.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   You can wear them out to dinner or to concerts
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.480]   or out with friends.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.240]   So it turns out it is indeed possible
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.960]   to support your biology, to be scientific about it
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   and to remain social after all.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.080]   If you'd like to try Roka, go to roka.com.

[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.100]   I love the story about spending time with your kids
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.800]   on vacation as unstructured time,
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.460]   as well as spending unstructured time
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.080]   with them playing Legos at home.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.780]   My graduate advisor sadly passed away very young of cancer.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.020]   She was 50 and I knew her kids
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.860]   really when they were in the womb
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.420]   'cause she was pregnant with the first one
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.720]   and I attended the memorial service there
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.500]   and it was an incredible thing
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.540]   because people gave their speeches
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.760]   and her kids got up and by then they were,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   I think, about eight and 11 or so.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.200]   And I'm sure they had a great many thoughts
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.680]   and feelings that they didn't share.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.560]   But the one thing that really stood out
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.040]   is they appreciated how much unstructured time
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.400]   their mom had spent with them.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.120]   It wasn't this like big event or something.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.560]   It was all the unstructured time
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.640]   that she had spent with them.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.080]   And that was very inherent to the kind of person she was.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.520]   And so that really stuck with me
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.120]   and God willing, you live a very long time.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.360]   But I think for anyone listening to this
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.500]   and because of the statement that Kahneman made
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.140]   where that we are not well calibrated
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.420]   to sense a future regret,
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.940]   the unstructured time is perhaps
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.360]   one of the most valuable things
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.980]   that we can give our relationships,
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.340]   both the people we engage in them with and ourselves.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.620]   And I don't think it's discussed enough.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.100]   - There's a gerontologist named Karl Pillmer
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.300]   who wrote a great book called "30 Lessons for Living."
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.260]   And what he did is he interviewed about 100 centenarians
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.740]   and he just said, "Tell me about your life.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.900]   What advice do you have for the rest of us?"
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.820]   And there's a section of his book about money.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.820]   And he says of the 1,000 people,
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.960]   it was 1,000 people he interviewed,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.680]   of the 1,000 centenarians he interviewed,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.160]   not a single one of them looking back at their lives
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.460]   said, "I wish I earned more money."
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.720]   Not one, but virtually every one of them said,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.480]   "I wish I spent more time with my kids.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.800]   I wish I was nicer to people.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.580]   I wish I spent more time with my friends, my family."
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.680]   That was universal.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.080]   But earn more money was not in there whatsoever.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.000]   That stuck with me.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.600]   - And as you point out, however,
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.180]   earning money allows for the opportunity
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.500]   to spend time with kids and loved ones of all kinds.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.140]   - It can, but I think there are a lot of people
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.040]   for whom it's the opposite.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.480]   If you are a partner at a law firm,
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.420]   you're earning a ton of money.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.500]   Congratulations, great.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.820]   You probably have a big house and a nice car.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.620]   You're also probably working 100 hours a week.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.340]   And the things that might fill your soul,
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.120]   it's different for everybody, this is not universal,
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.260]   but what might actually make you happy,
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   spending time with your friends, your family,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.940]   exercising, sleeping late, is not available to you.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.180]   So that's why it's independence plus purpose.
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.240]   And I think there are a lot of people
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   who make millions of dollars per year
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.740]   and have no independence whatsoever.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.860]   They are completely tied to their boss's whims,
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.180]   to their work, to their employer.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.020]   They might love it.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.260]   I'm not saying you shouldn't do that,
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.500]   but they have no independence at all.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.940]   I think there are billionaires who have no independence
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.780]   because they are so tied to doing things
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.340]   whether they like it or not.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.100]   And I think a lot of people go crazy in that situation
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.620]   because they're like, "I'm making $5 million a year,
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.980]   but it's not making me any happier."
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.420]   It's like, yeah, what would make you happier
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.260]   is independence.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.100]   And you are pushing yourself away from that.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.180]   You were probably more independent when you were 15
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.240]   and had no money than you are at 40
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.940]   making millions of dollars a year.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.780]   - So then in an ideal world,
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.040]   which of course doesn't exist,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.980]   one would find a vocation or a pursuit
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.660]   that they found really meaningful,
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.960]   would work really, really hard,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.980]   would make enough money to then, I guess,
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.700]   retire and spend unstructured time with the people you love
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.720]   and then simply stop working.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.500]   In this model that clearly is an artificial model
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.620]   that I'm creating here,
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.140]   because it seems like after a certain point,
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.220]   provided you earned that money through an effort
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.660]   that you felt was meaningful,
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.500]   presumably with people you enjoy,
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.720]   or even if it wasn't, you found it meaningful,
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.560]   you make that money,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.180]   then it seems that it's all about human interactions
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.020]   at that point.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.980]   - Yeah, and what's true is that that scenario,
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.380]   that dream scenario might be true for 1% of the people,
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.220]   that they can earn enough money to retire young
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.700]   and then pursue whatever they want.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.420]   There's an entrepreneur named Felix Dennis
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.780]   who wrote a book many years ago called "How to Get Rich."
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.900]   And there's a quote in that book, he says,
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.660]   he was at the time, maybe in his 70s
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.820]   and worth about a billion dollars, something like that.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.940]   And he said, "If I knew what I knew now
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.540]   and I could do life over again,
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.780]   I would make as much money as I could,
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.580]   retire at age 35 and plant trees and write poetry."
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.660]   And he's like, "Looking back,
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.100]   that's what I should have done."
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.420]   But let's leave aside that, of course,
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.260]   not everybody can do that.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.340]   - What did he do? He kept working.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.180]   - He kept working.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.500]   - Even though he didn't need more money.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.320]   - Absolutely.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.620]   - This is interesting because people who do achieve
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.500]   a high degree of wealth at a young age seem to keep going.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.140]   And we could make all sorts of assumptions
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.620]   about why it is that they do that.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.620]   Expectations from others that their ego,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.100]   literally their sense of self in some way
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.020]   or perhaps entirely is tied to the sense
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.900]   that they're still in pursuit,
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.300]   that it's somehow a failure to opt out at that point.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.140]   I mean, we can speculate all day,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   but what this guy Felix said really rings true.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.300]   It seems like once people reach a number
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.740]   and it for everyone, it's going to be different.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.960]   It's not going to be a billion dollars for everybody.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.860]   Once they have enough resources for themselves
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.220]   and the people they need to take care of,
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.020]   maybe a bit more as a buffer,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.220]   it makes no sense to continue on that path.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.620]   - Well, I think there are a lot of people.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.260]   I think you're one of them and I'm one of them
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.720]   who enjoy what they do.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.300]   And if you and I got to a point
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.080]   where we're completely financially independent,
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.580]   all the money we'll need for the rest of our life,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.920]   I would still be a writer.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.420]   You would still do your research 'cause we enjoy it.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.260]   - Yeah, absolutely. I love learning.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.100]   - It's not just, right.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.060]   And I think if, actually, if you are the kind of person
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.660]   who says, once I hit my number, I'm done,
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.780]   you probably don't love your work at all.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.460]   Almost by definition, you don't.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.660]   I think what's dangerous though,
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.620]   is when the money itself is part of your identity.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.620]   I like being a writer.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.060]   I like the process of writing.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.620]   But if I were to say, I have to keep writing books
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.860]   'cause I need to make more money.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.540]   I just, I have to have a higher net worth,
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.060]   particularly if I'm past the point
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.080]   of taking care of my family.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.500]   Then at that point,
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.200]   I think money is actually like a liability.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.800]   It's a financial asset and a psychological liability.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.860]   It's taking control over what you're doing in life.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.180]   If you're saying, I have to have more of it.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.940]   I mean, if there's anything in life where you're like,
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.260]   I have to have more.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.300]   And even when I get more,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.260]   my satiation point goes higher and higher.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.200]   What is that?
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.340]   It's an addiction.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   And that's, it's controlling you at that point.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.260]   So there are a lot of people
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.060]   for whom money is a financial asset
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.580]   and a psychological liability.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.180]   And I think that's actually true
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.220]   for some of the richest people in society.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.780]   That the more, like it grows exponentially over time,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.660]   the richer you become,
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.620]   the more addicted to having more, it grows on you.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.000]   - In the backdrop of everything we've talked about thus far
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.160]   is the biology of dopamine reward.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.520]   Dopamine, of course, being a molecule
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.940]   that people associate with reward,
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.760]   but it's really about the pursuit of reward.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.600]   It's about more.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.900]   It's about, and it's no coincidence
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.960]   that dopamine is involved in generating movement
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.800]   in the body.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.760]   This is why people with Parkinson's
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.340]   who are depleted in dopamine can't generate movement.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.240]   And it's also involved in generating cognitive movement
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.000]   and pursuit, paying attention to things.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.360]   There is this idea that I've been pushing
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.860]   for a few years now that kind of throws its arms
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.780]   around a big literature on dopamine
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.140]   that says that addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.180]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:05.620]   But your definition is actually much better, I realize.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.420]   Addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.900]   of the things that bring you pleasure and or safety
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.980]   or a sense of safety, right?
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.940]   Because here we're not talking about making more money
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.680]   to enjoy things more.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.820]   We're talking about making more money
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.500]   to avoid the sense that pain is coming
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.920]   or that we are vulnerable.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.080]   - And for a lot of people, that pain is a social pain
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.820]   that they're not gonna climb high enough
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.740]   on the social ladder,
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.140]   that their peers are earning more than them,
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.380]   that their neighbors have a bigger house,
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.200]   whatever it might be.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.660]   That's the pain that they're trying to avoid.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.740]   And that is a game that cannot be won
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.380]   because gratefully, thankfully,
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.180]   there are a lot of very wealthy people in this world.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.900]   And no matter how much money you're making,
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.500]   there's always somebody out there who's earning more,
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.180]   living better and has a bigger house and a nicer car.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.540]   That's always the case.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.620]   So if you are on that path of,
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.760]   I need to earn more to climb that ladder
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.700]   so I can have more than the next guy,
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.860]   I mean, that's a game that you cannot win.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.300]   And I think that game of comparison too
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.620]   also grows the wealthier you are.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.580]   That you are, the billionaires are more likely
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.700]   to compare themselves to other billionaires
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.180]   than the minimum wage worker is
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.340]   to compare themselves to somebody making $10 an hour
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.340]   or whatever.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.400]   You are more likely to compare your lifestyle
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.500]   the richer you become.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.020]   And since that comparison to other people
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.340]   is what gives you a feeling of inadequacy,
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.180]   there's this irony.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.700]   It's hard to wrap your head around it
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.660]   and come to terms with it,
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.180]   but some of the most money insecure people you'll ever meet
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.820]   are the richest people you'll ever meet.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.780]   People who live in a 15,000 square foot mansion,
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.340]   yeah, but he's got a 17,000 square foot mansion.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.420]   Things that ordinary people would never consider
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.100]   that just consumes their life.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.780]   And again, that's the point where money
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.660]   is like the psychological debt.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.360]   It's psychological liability.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.340]   It's controlling their,
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.460]   it becomes an integral part of their identity.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.860]   They wake up in the morning and look in the mirror
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.540]   and they see a person who makes money.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.360]   That's their identity.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.200]   Who are you?
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.100]   I'm a person who makes money.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.920]   And that's when like your process of chasing it
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.420]   just becomes like a detriment to your happiness over time.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.700]   You're not using it as a tool to live a better life.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.080]   You're using it as a yardstick
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.980]   to measure yourself against others by.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:08.500]   - I fundamentally believe that all forms of addiction,
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.020]   all forms of addiction are fundamentally a fear of death.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:18.020]   They're a way of shrinking our aperture on time perception
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.440]   so that we're in pursuit of something.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.860]   And for people that can place their addiction within work,
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.940]   it has this feedback of being "functional"
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.460]   as opposed to dysfunctional.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.600]   This is also true for people that are continually
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.380]   seeking awards within their profession.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.420]   I mean, there are these professions, academia included,
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.900]   but other professions where people are constantly
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.440]   pinning awards on one another.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.900]   And it gives us illusion of progress when in fact
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.900]   there's a whole world of things happening.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.860]   Now, these people often have quite healthy families
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.420]   and relationships, so they're not mutually exclusive.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.820]   But I think I know a few billionaires, not many,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.620]   but I know some that are very happy.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.380]   They tend to be the people that are still working
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.500]   and in pursuit of new things, avid learners.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.440]   But perhaps by virtue of the work that I do,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.140]   which is focused on science, but also health,
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.940]   the modern billionaires that I'm aware of
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.380]   seem to be very focused on not just making money,
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.980]   but also trying to secure their place on the planet
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.580]   for a very long time.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.460]   Not through legacy, although I think many of them
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.500]   like to provide for the next generations
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.640]   and their families, surely.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.440]   Not so much by putting their names on the sides
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.060]   of buildings anymore, this used to be the way it was done,
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.660]   but rather trying to secure their health status.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.860]   Because the one thing that money can buy sort of
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.180]   is better health care, but money can't buy you
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.940]   more years of your life, except by virtue of the things
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.620]   that you are willing to not do and do behaviorally.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.940]   You still have to exercise,
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.380]   you still have to get your sleep,
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.800]   you have to avoid certain things.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:58.780]   And so the modern billionaires often are talking about
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.980]   what they're doing for their health
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   as opposed to their yacht, their car, et cetera.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.780]   This has now become the kind of metric for comparison.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.520]   Blood profiles become a sort of point of bragging
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.380]   for people, it's pretty interesting.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.700]   Especially given that you just look back about 50
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.060]   or even 100 years and further back,
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.660]   and the more wealthy people were,
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.380]   the less physical labor they were doing.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.700]   Now they're doing more physical labor
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.100]   to try and live longer.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.940]   So what are your thoughts on the relationship
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.780]   between physical health and money?
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.300]   I mean, obviously there's a sweet spot there,
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.260]   but there's no pill that people can purchase to live longer.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.980]   - Right, I view it in the negative sense
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.200]   of the people who work to get money so hard
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.160]   that it takes a physical toll on their body.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.980]   And that is so incredibly common.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.560]   And that's another form of debt
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.120]   that you can very easily measure your net worth
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.960]   and your income.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.460]   You can put a number on it very clean to measure.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.080]   How do you measure, it's much harder to measure your health.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.640]   And I think it's easier for people to say,
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.880]   "Yes, I'm only sleeping five hours a night,
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.800]   "and I'm on my third divorce and I'm overweight,
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.440]   "but I'm making a lot of money this year."
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.080]   Because one is very easy to measure,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.540]   and the others are much harder.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.740]   Your happiness, your health, what not,
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.080]   it's harder to measure that.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.720]   And I do think too that if you are very wealthy,
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.520]   particularly the very, very wealthy,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.960]   you get so accustomed towards,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.320]   I can snap my fingers and literally get anything,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.200]   a Gulfstream jet, a mansion, whatever,
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.960]   I can get it right now.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.400]   But health is like this last elusive thing
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.600]   that by and large you cannot purchase.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.200]   And I think that drives a lot of people crazy.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.760]   And that's why if you can have anything in the world
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.520]   by snapping your fingers and getting it,
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.320]   then you eventually move towards
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.660]   what's the thing that you don't have,
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.640]   and that's immortality.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.640]   And I think that there's a long history of that
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   going back to the robber barons.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.200]   John D. Rockefeller was obsessed with it.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.720]   Andrew Carnegie was obsessed with it.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.440]   If you can have everything material in the world,
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.520]   you're still gonna have desire.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.760]   And ordinary people can sit around and dream and say,
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.640]   "One day I'm gonna have the mansion."
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.480]   We're not even a mansion.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.860]   "One day I'm gonna have a house of my own.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.700]   "I'm gonna have a car.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.520]   "I'm gonna send my kids to college."
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.840]   Everybody wants to dream.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.280]   So if all that is a given,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.640]   you have all the money you could ever spend,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.560]   you still wanna dream.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.400]   So what do you dream about?
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.920]   You dream about immortality.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.360]   And so I think that's been the case
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.220]   for a very long period of time.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.980]   What's interesting too is that there was a historian
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.860]   who looked back at the British peerage.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.980]   He got a lot of data on how long people lived
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.700]   in various points of the UK economy.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.740]   And what he found was until about, I think it was 1750,
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.660]   the richest members of the UK had among the shortest lives.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.780]   The poorest people were some of them
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.140]   who were living the longest.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:28.980]   And he dug into it.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.800]   So how could this be?
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.860]   The richest people die the fastest.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.140]   And what he found is the richest people
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.060]   were the only ones who could afford
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.980]   all the quack medicines and the sham doctors
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.260]   who were just poisoning them.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.740]   They were poisoning them back in the day
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.500]   when we knew nothing about medicine.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.100]   So I think the idea of I want a better life
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.420]   and I should be able to buy that.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.260]   Like there's a long history
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.180]   of that backfiring on people as well.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.860]   Yeah, there's a lot of excitement right now
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.300]   about stem cells and treatments
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.620]   that currently are not available in the United States
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.460]   that are available out of country.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.220]   And I get asked about these a lot.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.260]   Most of them don't have FDA approval yet.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.540]   Some of them probably never will have FDA approval.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.540]   We'll probably talk about stem cells another time.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.560]   - Do you think you see this though,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.340]   where the wealthiest people are spending money
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.380]   on treatments that you either know are not going to work
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.380]   or are very questionable?
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.980]   - Yeah, all the time.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.260]   - And that might backfire on you.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.840]   That might make you less healthy.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.680]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.780]   I mean, I'll just point out,
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.980]   I don't have anything against stem cell therapies.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.940]   I think they hold great potential,
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:31.260]   but there is a true story about a stem cell clinic
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.220]   down in Florida prior to the FDA,
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.540]   bringing the gavel down on them
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.460]   of injecting stem cells into the eyes of wealthy people
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.380]   who could afford the treatment.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.300]   These people had certain markers for macular degeneration
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.780]   and other things that can cause blindness.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.260]   And guess what happened to these people?
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.220]   They all went blind.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.940]   So that brought the gavel down on stem cell therapies
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.480]   generally in this country.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.040]   A lot of people are getting infusions of stem cells
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.820]   and related things out of country.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.800]   They're coming back and they're walking and talking.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.980]   So, and they're calling me
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.900]   and they're asking what my thoughts are.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.060]   And I have a lot of thoughts.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.740]   I mean, I think that the basics of longevity are clear,
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.580]   right?
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.260]   I mean, you want to avoid head trauma
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.540]   and environmental toxins.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.460]   Those things are real.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.580]   And if you have certain mutations like BRCA mutations,
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.980]   you need to be more careful about cancer and avoid smoking,
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.860]   all this stuff, right?
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.540]   Alcohol turns out to be pro-cancerous
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.600]   and things of that sort.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.180]   But then it's, you know, it's physical activity,
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.980]   it's nutrition, it's social connection, it's sleep,
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.220]   it's sunlight is, you know,
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.180]   it's all the things that I've talked about on this podcast
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.140]   and that other people talk about as well.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.400]   But yes, very wealthy people are looking for that edge
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.560]   to live longer.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.100]   And it is true that when you start to layer in
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.340]   all the basics of do's and don'ts, all the behaviors,
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.040]   and then you start to augment that with a few extra things,
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.620]   you get the sense of more vigor
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.520]   that sort of suggests they may live longer,
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.220]   but we still don't know.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.060]   - Right.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:45:59.880]   - We still don't know.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.580]   With the exception of exercise that we absolutely know
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.380]   can enrich mitochondrial density,
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.860]   give people more energy and vigor, et cetera.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.460]   You know, most of this is still a big question mark.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.920]   - See, I could see a very wealthy person using their money
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.840]   if you are very sick and you have a rare cancer
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.220]   to throw the kitchen sink at it.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.780]   - Oh, every excellent doctor.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.140]   - Those million dollar therapies, well, not absolutely.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.220]   I think it's a different animal
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.380]   if you are already pretty healthy to say,
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.680]   I'm gonna throw my money at trying to become immortal
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.060]   or close to it, whatever it might be.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.580]   That's a different thing.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.460]   - I totally agree.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.660]   And I think what we're talking about here is,
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.300]   you said it fairly quickly,
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.860]   but I think I wanna highlight it
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.380]   because I think it's really important
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.340]   that even people who have billions of dollars
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.700]   still have a sense of yearning
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.540]   for something that's missing or that they don't have.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.540]   And in some cases that's the sustaining factor
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.780]   to their wellbeing.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.100]   You said it's also good to be in pursuit, right?
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.520]   Maybe that's with dopamine too, right?
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.040]   We always want more.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.480]   It's the pursuit of more.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.080]   And if you're wealthy enough to have everything,
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.360]   you still have a part of your brain that's like,
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.440]   yeah, but I want more, I want more, I want more.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.640]   And if you've exhausted the physical part of the world,
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.880]   that material part of the world,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.200]   and let's leave aside the billionaires,
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.880]   even the average ordinary American family
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.800]   that owns a modest house, owns a car that functions well,
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.720]   owns nice clothes, will send their kids to a state school.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.080]   By a lot of historical definitions, they have everything.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.200]   They have everything you would ever need,
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.520]   but you're always yearning for more.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.960]   It's always this pursuit of, well, what else don't I have?
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.320]   And I think what you want more than anything in life
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.680]   is what you want and cannot have.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   That's what you're gonna chase with all of your effort
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.720]   is the thing that you want and cannot have.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.340]   And I think that's where health comes in
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.180]   for a lot of these people.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.760]   - As long as you think that there's a possibility
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.040]   you could get it.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.920]   The dopamine circuit loves,
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.820]   you want what you feel is just out of your reach,
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.600]   but might be possible to achieve.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.560]   I mean, this is why people throw
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.800]   so much money away gambling.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.360]   But maybe with social media, it makes it seem
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.260]   so that there are virtually anything is within your reach.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.080]   Because it used to be before social media
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.320]   that your view of the world was mostly your neighbors
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.920]   and your coworkers and your siblings.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.640]   And now everybody's view of the world
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.400]   is a curated highlight reel
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.240]   of the most extreme events in the world.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.360]   So if you are a 15 year old scrolling through Instagram,
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.480]   then what is within your reach,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.680]   what looks within your reach is a Ferrari
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.240]   and a private jet and a mansion
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.280]   in a way that didn't exist when you and I were kids.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.840]   And I think it makes the aspiration level that much harder.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.400]   - And real examples of people who went from nothing
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.800]   to immensely popular or wealthy, et cetera.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:39.600]   I mean, gosh, I would say about once a month,
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.440]   somebody walks right up to me and says,
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.920]   "Just watch someday I'm gonna have the top podcast
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.160]   in the world on blank."
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.720]   And they're trying to seed this thing
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.040]   that they've seen on social media,
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.720]   which are examples of people kind of,
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.180]   it used to be called rags to riches,
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.080]   but the parallels in different universes.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.280]   But there's a famous musician,
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.720]   I think his name is Ed Sheeran,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.680]   who there's still a video of him early on
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.720]   saying like he knew he was gonna make it.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.440]   If you watch the Conor McGregor documentary, it's amazing.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.080]   I think it's called "Notorious" on Netflix.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   Even if people aren't into MMA,
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.960]   they should at least watch the first part.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.440]   He was videotaping himself very early on.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.080]   And he made this prediction
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.560]   that he was gonna be a world champion.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.400]   And then he ends up being a world champion, right?
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.320]   - This is a great anecdote that Kanye West
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.420]   used to practice his Grammy speech
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.860]   when he was walking to the train
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.340]   because he couldn't afford the car.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.780]   Like when he was an absolute nobody,
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.740]   he was practicing his Grammy acceptance speech
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.840]   of just like absolute ambition of where you're going.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.900]   - Yeah, and I don't know if this anecdote is true,
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.660]   but there's the anecdote that I heard
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.980]   that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.820]   practicing their Academy Awards acceptance speech
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.140]   in the schoolyard when they were kids.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.220]   And then they gave their speech
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.540]   and they were laughing about that.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.880]   I grew up skateboarding.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.620]   So when I first got into it,
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.600]   the Tony Hawks and the Mike McGills and Steve Caballeros,
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.520]   these were the names at the time,
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.560]   were like these luminaries, right?
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.360]   The gap between us and them was so huge.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.000]   By the time I was a junior in high school,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.240]   my best friend at the time, Paul Zuanich,
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.580]   sent in a videotape of himself to a company
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.760]   called Planet Earth.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.680]   He got sponsored.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.780]   Next thing you know, we're in the shop
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.600]   watching him skateboard.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.080]   And within a year or two, he had his own pro model.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.880]   So I think social media gives us
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.080]   not just the sense of what's out there,
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.260]   but it gives us very salient examples
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.900]   of people that went from completely unknown
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.840]   to extremely known.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.320]   Just this last year, there's the, you know,
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.200]   the so-called Hawktua girl, you know,
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.680]   is interviewed outside a bar saying like,
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.600]   she now has a very popular podcast.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.360]   She has sponsors, she's known.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.760]   - Literally became one of the most famous people
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.600]   in the country.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.880]   - Right, and has a financial stream now
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.800]   of income through her podcast.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.560]   And so this raises the sort of idea in people's minds
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.020]   or the possibility, however remote,
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.860]   that if somebody puts a camera in front of you,
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.420]   by virtue of one thing that you say,
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.880]   you could suddenly be an internationally known person
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.680]   and potentially go from quote unquote rags to riches.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.600]   - If you look at the studies, when you ask teenagers,
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.920]   what is your preferred career?
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.080]   What do you want to be when you grow up?
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.280]   It used to be astronaut, used to be doctor,
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.360]   used to be entrepreneur.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.280]   Now it's influencer by far is what people want to be.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.000]   It seems like the quickest path to fame and wealth.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.480]   And for a lot of people, it is.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.960]   My sister-in-law is a kindergarten teacher.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.140]   She has a girl in her class who has over a million followers
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.960]   on YouTube as a kindergartner.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   Like that didn't exist when you and I were kids
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.520]   or it was so rare.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.480]   But now like enough people know stories like that,
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.500]   even if there are a few of them,
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.840]   enough people know stories to give you the sense of hope
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.380]   of like, well, if they could do it, I could do it too.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.800]   - Well, I'll tell everyone out there that
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.160]   if you think that fame is what you want,
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.840]   fame restricts your freedom.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.360]   It does not increase your freedom.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.320]   - There's a great quote from Naval
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.960]   where he says what you want to be is rich and anonymous.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.400]   That's a sweet spot that you want to be.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.640]   The opposite, you are poor and famous.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.280]   And that's the hardest spot to be in.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.600]   But if you can be rich and anonymous,
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.200]   because I think there's a really important concept
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   with money that I call social debt,
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.280]   which is when the money that you have influences,
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.020]   it changes how other people think of you.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.600]   And even maybe how you think about yourself.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.280]   And you can measure your asset.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.720]   It's not actually debt.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.800]   Like it's not like debt you repay the bank,
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.060]   but it is very much a debt in terms of
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.960]   it is an anchor on your happiness that you have to repay.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.020]   And fame is the ultimate social debt.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.420]   And for a lot of people, their social debt of fame
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.920]   is more than the money that they made
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.120]   from whatever made them famous to begin with.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.000]   And there's this anecdote from Tiger Woods
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.760]   where he said he loves scuba diving
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.480]   because when he's 100 feet under the ocean
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.760]   is the only time in the world
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.280]   where people aren't taking pictures of him
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.840]   and asking things of him and gawking at him.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.720]   Like that sucks.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.160]   That's not that you have a lot of sympathy
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.840]   for somebody like that, but it does suck.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.640]   Like you can measure his net worth very quickly.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.480]   What's your net worth?
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.440]   Just show me the number.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.240]   How do you measure the liability
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.860]   of feeling like you have no privacy
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.400]   unless you are scuba diving?
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.760]   That's a hard thing.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.000]   And at various levels, a lot of people have that.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.780]   Even if you are earn a modest income
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.920]   and all of a sudden your friends, your family start saying,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.580]   "Hey, I heard you got a raise.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.480]   "I could use a little bit myself."
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.360]   That's a social debt.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.080]   They want you to pay at dinner and whatnot.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.300]   And of course, maybe you're happy to do that.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.220]   You're happy to share it.
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.960]   But let's not pretend that there's not
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.240]   a little bit of social debt and liability
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.780]   that comes with every added amount of income that you have.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.360]   - I mean, so much of social media is just by definition
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.800]   in terms of the number of followers being displayed,
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.160]   et cetera, number of likes and comments being displayed
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.280]   is designed to set up these metrics of comparison.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.800]   - Yeah, the smartest minds of the generation
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.520]   work at Facebook and Instagram and Twitter
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.340]   to figure out how to give you FOMO,
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.120]   how to generate a little bit more dopamine.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.520]   And they're very good at it.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.800]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.520]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.160]   I recently became a Function member
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.440]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.460]   to lab testing.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.360]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.340]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.960]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.840]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.640]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.900]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.320]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.060]   Function not only provides testing
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.520]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.160]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.040]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.600]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.440]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.560]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.880]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.680]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.540]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.040]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.720]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.000]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.780]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.140]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.040]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.100]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.860]   and detoxification, and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.420]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.840]   is so important for health,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.620]   and while I've been doing it for years,
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.540]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.040]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.940]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.460]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.380]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.780]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board,
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.020]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.340]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.620]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:15.220]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.820]   but they're offering early access
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.060]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.340]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.320]   to get early access to Function.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.980]   One thing that I wish somebody would do,
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:31.660]   maybe it's been done, is you mentioned earlier this,
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:36.160]   not typical, but I guess semi-common thing of an article
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.300]   will come out and say, you know,
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.660]   the five things that people say on their deathbed,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.420]   or that they, and they look back,
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.660]   and they mentioned that they wish
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.020]   they'd spent less time at work.
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.380]   They wish they had spent more time with their kids,
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.780]   or more time in nature, perhaps.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.100]   Has anyone ever just asked people directly,
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.460]   what were the things that they are most proud of,
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.500]   or the things that they really feel
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.300]   brought them tremendous meaning then,
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.260]   and as they're passing away?
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.800]   Because it's related,
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.440]   but it's kind of the inverse of the same question.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.280]   Yeah, Warren Buffett brought this up one time.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.680]   He said a good way to think about life is,
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.640]   it's kind of grim, but he said,
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.880]   write what you want your obituary to say,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.000]   and then work backwards to live up to it.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   And in that situation, if you were to write,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.160]   like, what do you want your obituary to say?
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.120]   Most people would say,
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.400]   oh, I hope it says Morgan was a good father.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.360]   He was a good husband.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.480]   He helped his community.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.200]   He was admired by his coworkers.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.240]   That's what I want it to say.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.100]   And for a lot of people, it's different for everyone,
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.680]   but it would be something like that.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.960]   And why Buffett said it was important
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.480]   is because nobody who's writing their preferred obituary
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.460]   would say, would include the size of their house,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.480]   how many horsepower their car had,
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.640]   how nice their clothes were,
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.680]   'cause everybody knows it doesn't matter.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.220]   And it's like, forget who made this idea.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:54.560]   There's a thing between resume virtues and eulogy virtues.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.400]   That was David Brooks.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.920]   David Brooks said that, thank you.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.860]   Resume virtues are, you know, how much money you make,
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.200]   your degrees, everything.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.260]   Eulogy virtues is, he was a great father.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.140]   He was a great friend.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:04.980]   He helped his community.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.940]   He was funny.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.980]   And I think most people really aspire
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.080]   to have eulogy virtues,
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.580]   but they spend all their day chasing resume virtues.
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.800]   Resume virtues can be great.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.820]   I want a good education.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.140]   I want a good income.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.540]   But what you're really trying to chase
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.380]   is to use those things to gain more resume virtues
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:20.220]   at the end of the day.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.760]   So I think if you think about it through that lens,
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.940]   a lot of these things become clear.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.540]   And that's why, like I said,
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:29.220]   going on a great vacation with my kids, if that's a 10,
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.620]   what's really fun about that is spending time with them
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.080]   when I'm detached from work.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.760]   I'm not checking my phone every seven seconds.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.840]   I'm just spending hours with my kids,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   giving them my full attention.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.040]   That's what made me happy.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.000]   The view was great on the beach, cool,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.880]   but that's what made me happy.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.680]   And I can do that at home, can't I?
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.360]   And so that's the difference between,
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.000]   like going to Maui is a resume virtue.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.440]   Spending time with your kids is a eulogy virtue.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.040]   - Why is it, do you think,
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.240]   that even though we've perhaps all heard by now
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.380]   that compounding interest is great, right?
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.140]   You can put in, let's say a small
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.540]   or a moderate amount of money into,
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.060]   even just a savings account that's accruing a couple percent
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.900]   varies year by year and with the economy, of course,
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.420]   or into the markets that over time,
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.080]   if you quote unquote set it and forget it,
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.740]   just kind of like put it there and walk away,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.820]   that you're likely to make X percent over time.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.180]   And you can look at the plot.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.420]   You can look at that line upward and to the right.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.780]   It almost always is jagged line
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.340]   drifting upward to the right.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.040]   And even just scroll over and see, okay, at age, whatever,
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   I'm going to have X number of dollars.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.120]   And that value is often very high
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.840]   relative to where one's current wealth is.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.160]   Even if they're a student or they have very little put away.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.920]   We all hear this, we can see it.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.120]   You can run the models.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.160]   It's almost trivial.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.200]   And yet people don't do that
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.520]   even if they have the income to save.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.880]   Is it that hard for us to project our emotional state
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.900]   and the sorts of things that we integrate
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.420]   in terms of life meaning and value into the future,
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.060]   that most people just don't do that?
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.020]   And why do you think that is?
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.060]   I mean, I'm not asking you to play neurobiologist here.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.060]   I mean, I think we both agree
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:10.200]   that time perception is a complicated thing,
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.540]   but you would think that people would just sort of get it,
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.700]   but we're not rational.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.380]   Most people aren't rational in that way.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:17.980]   They don't save, they don't invest,
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:19.240]   and they don't compound interest.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.020]   And so they end up with a lot less money
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.820]   than they could have and a lot more regret.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.620]   - Yeah, I think there's two ways to think about this.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.020]   One is my friend Michael Batnick phrased it this way.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.460]   He said, "If I ask you what is eight plus eight
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.700]   "plus eight plus eight,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.200]   "you figure that out in five seconds."
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.040]   That's an easy one.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.180]   If I said, "What is eight times eight
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.740]   "times eight times eight times eight?"
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.820]   Even if you're a math nerd, it's too hard.
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.640]   You can't figure it out.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.300]   We're not wired for exponential thinking.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.580]   You just can't do it.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.220]   And therefore, even if you show you the numbers,
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.060]   "Hey, invest a small amount, retire with a million dollars."
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.220]   I think it's so counterintuitive
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.420]   that most people see that and they're like,
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.140]   "Eh, okay, that doesn't really seem right.
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:54.640]   "It doesn't really pass the sniff test."
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.820]   How big the numbers can get,
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.900]   how quickly the numbers can get big.
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.700]   The other thing is if you tell a young person,
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.940]   "Hey, you have 50 years in front of you to invest.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.680]   "That's great, time's on your side.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.180]   "When you're 70 years old, you're gonna have $10 million.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.980]   "50 years from now might as well be 10,000 years from now."
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.420]   You're talking about people who don't know
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.740]   what they're gonna eat for dinner tonight.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.560]   And you're talking about like,
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.420]   "Hey, let's talk about the year 2077."
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.540]   It's so far out of there.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.580]   Even if that's the right way to think about it,
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.240]   it's a tough way to think about it.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.620]   And time perception, you mentioned,
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.220]   is so difficult for people.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.700]   If I said, "You're gonna get punched in the face
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.380]   "in 10 seconds," that's a fear.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.220]   And you're like, "Oh, I don't."
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.600]   But if I said, "Someone's gonna punch you in the face
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.900]   "50 years from now," I'll deal with it when I get there.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.100]   It's so easy to put out of sight, out of mind.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.380]   And the other thing is Warren Buffett
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.220]   talked about this a lot.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.260]   He said, actually, it was Charlie Munger who said this.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.060]   He said, "When teaching finance to young people,
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.020]   "people either understand it instantly or never."
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.620]   It's like some people are just wired to get it
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.720]   and some people aren't.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.900]   And that's always been the case.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.420]   Munger often said all the time,
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.620]   he said, "The iron rule of math is only 1% of people
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.300]   "can end up in the top 1%."
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.940]   And that's why, for a lot of people,
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.940]   yes, you should save and invest for 50 years.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.380]   Let's not pretend that that is easy
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.460]   or that everybody is psychologically able to do it.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.500]   Some people are wired differently.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.660]   Of course, that's the case, as they are with health
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.900]   and intelligence and lots of other things.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.220]   So I do think there's a thing for financial education
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.860]   with getting people to understand what is possible.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.300]   But I don't think we'll ever live in a world
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.100]   where everyone gets it and does it.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.940]   I don't think that world has never existed
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.380]   and I think will never exist because it's not math,
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.820]   it's not a spreadsheet, it's behavior.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.500]   And we now live in a world
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.120]   where we understand the dangers of smoking
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.260]   and highly processed foods and whatever it might be.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.940]   But even if we know it, people still do it
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.360]   because it's behavioral, it's not intelligence.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.880]   So showing people the numbers
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.980]   and getting them to do it is night and day.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.700]   - Do you know how they got people to stop smoking,
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.240]   in particular young people?
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.460]   It wasn't by scaring them about their health.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.380]   Turns out the most effective campaign to get,
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.700]   especially young people to stop smoking
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:57.700]   was to hijack the inherent rebellion of youth
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.900]   and to display ads of wealthy older people
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.380]   in rooms full of smoke.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.880]   So it became us as the youth rebelling against them,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.900]   the older generation that are trying to take our money,
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.460]   it had nothing to do with health.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.820]   - I love that. - And it absolutely worked.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.100]   And I have friends that work on this sort of thing
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.540]   in the context of public health,
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.620]   as it relates to all sorts of public health initiatives.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.340]   And the effective way to change human behavior
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.820]   as it relates to health is to incentivize aesthetics,
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.820]   to incentivize fear or to hijack fear of dying.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.420]   But even fear of dying is not sufficient
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:42.420]   as compared to hijacking these cross-generational,
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.380]   let's just call them frictions that exist.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.860]   So I found that to be interesting.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.340]   You used a math example of eight plus eight plus eight
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.660]   plus eight versus eight times eight times eight times eight.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.860]   And you said that the human brain
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.780]   is not capable of exponential thinking,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.460]   or most people's brains are not capable
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.500]   of exponential thinking.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.580]   I think you either intentionally or inadvertently
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.460]   hit on something really important.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.200]   I don't know that the dopamine reward system,
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.660]   which is the fundamental currency of pursuit and reward
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.060]   across all timescales, it's kind of wild, right?
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.700]   One neuromodulator, and there are other things involved
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:18.820]   that modulate that modulator,
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:23.460]   but one neuromodulator is involved in reward pursuit
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.620]   across all timescales, whether or not we're playing,
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.220]   let's say we're both competitive enough
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.240]   to play a game of chess or checkers,
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.740]   dopamine is motivating the pursuit for the win,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.640]   or a four-year degree or an eight-year degree,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.900]   or why you would want maybe your kids to win a soccer game.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.440]   Now you're like a third person in dopamine, right?
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.540]   It's across all timescales, all scenarios.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.060]   It's incredible, and across many species.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.180]   So it makes me wonder,
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.600]   and I'll have to ask some of my colleagues
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.300]   that work on these dopamine reward schedules for a living,
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.380]   whether or not the dopamine reward system
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.440]   actually can do exponential math.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.860]   It might not be able to do exponential math.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.580]   It might be that the pursuit of water,
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.180]   the pursuit of mates, the pursuit of food,
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.340]   the pursuit of shelter,
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.260]   which is what these dopamine circuits evolved
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.540]   under the constraints of,
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.400]   whether or not they are even capable
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.560]   of doing exponential thinking.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.680]   - Or if it's like the marshmallow test,
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.360]   which got misconstrued in many ways,
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.700]   but it's like, yeah, would you rather have one right now
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.540]   or two in the future?
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.880]   It's, I think for a lot of people, it's just like they're,
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.520]   there are some people for whom,
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.880]   like they're wired so differently for this.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.600]   So you hear stories about like the old,
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.520]   the old, very wealthy people, the old billionaires,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.040]   when they were 20 years old,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.240]   they would not get a haircut
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.160]   because they knew that $3 haircut
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.320]   would compound into $100 by the time they're older.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.440]   They were just so wired from birth to understand this
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.120]   and to have a very long perception of time to do it.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.560]   By definition, that's the rarity.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.880]   Most people are not like that.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.360]   And I don't know if they should be either.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.800]   I don't know if you should be the kind of person
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.000]   your entire life, who is always saving for a future
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.640]   and never enjoying what you have too.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.800]   Like that can lead to a lot of regret as well.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.160]   And there are those people.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.600]   - So let's parse the marshmallow test.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.560]   The marshmallow test, I think initially done at Stanford,
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.480]   I think it was a Bing nursery school or something like that,
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   or maybe somewhere at Stanford.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.000]   If I'm wrong, someone will correct me in the comments.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.800]   Of course, for those that don't know,
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.560]   is they brought these really cute kids into rooms
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.080]   and they put the marshmallow in front of them
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.280]   and they told them they could eat it now
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.120]   or they could wait
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.720]   and they could get two marshmallows later.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.760]   And then they videotaped them
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.400]   and the videos are absolutely delightful of the kids,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.760]   you know, like distracting themselves
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.980]   or having the marshmallows talk
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.440]   or taking a little piece of the marshmallows.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.840]   I mean, it reveals as much variation
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.360]   on human self-constraint behavior
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.840]   as you could possibly imagine.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.080]   And they're really interesting as you know.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.080]   I would like to know whether the children
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.920]   that were able to wait and therefore get two marshmallows
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.760]   were trying to resist the temptation
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.920]   or whether or not they were being pulled forward
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.400]   by the anticipation of two marshmallows.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.920]   - My understanding, and maybe this is not complete,
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.240]   but my understanding, at least part of it
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.040]   was neither of those two things.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.920]   The kids who did the best and resisted it
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.400]   were the ones who distracted themselves.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.800]   They weren't even thinking about the marshmallow.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.820]   They would sing a song,
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.160]   they would start playing with their shoes,
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160]   they'd play with another kid.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.640]   And the ones who could not resist
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.480]   are the ones who just sat there
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.360]   staring at the one marshmallow that was tempting them.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.600]   That's too hard to resist.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.240]   Almost everybody will resist that.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.000]   It was like the environment that they put themselves in.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.480]   - But they weren't thinking into the future
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.200]   about how great it would be to have two marshmallows.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.040]   - I don't think so.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.960]   I think they were, because their kids are so distracted.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.200]   They have the memory of a goldfish.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.160]   They wanted to just go do something.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.760]   They'd sing a song, they'd play with their shoes,
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.160]   they'd play with their friends.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.040]   And then by dint of doing that,
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.700]   all of a sudden they had waited long enough
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.000]   to get the two marshmallows.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.200]   I think that was at least part of it.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.160]   And I think that's true for a lot of people too.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.800]   Think about the stock market,
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.320]   where so much temptation to always watch it
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.200]   and see what it's doing.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.160]   'Cause we have CNBC and there's the ticker
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.640]   and the lights are green and red and whatnot.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.080]   For a lot of people, it's impossible to watch that.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.440]   Or even worse, in Robin Hood,
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.680]   you get a push notification on your phone.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.240]   That's too hard to resist.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.640]   But you know where you see very good investing behavior,
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.280]   where people do a really good job,
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.160]   is when you invest automatically every paycheck
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.600]   into your 401k and you forgot your password.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.920]   Because that environment is against temptation.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.800]   There's nothing to do.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.020]   You forgot your password.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.440]   But if you're just bombarding yourself with stimulus
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.440]   of what to do, most people cannot resist that.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.960]   - My way of dealing with social media,
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.800]   I would say compulsion, not addiction,
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.580]   is I now, one could take an old phone.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.000]   I actually got a phone specifically for social media.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.280]   So I have Instagram and X on that phone.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.640]   I don't even recall the number of that phone.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.520]   I airdrop things onto it if I wanna post
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.280]   and I do what Rogan calls post and ghost.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.380]   So you post and then it goes into a box.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.720]   Because otherwise, I'm just absolutely blown away
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.680]   by how much time can be sucked away.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.400]   - All of it.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.220]   - You tell yourself,
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.920]   "I'm gonna just look at social media for a moment."
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.960]   And then you're pulled down some rabbit hole.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.120]   It's just incredible the way they've designed
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.480]   these algorithms to get you.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.680]   And of course I like social media.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.840]   I teach on social media.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.720]   This conversation will probably be,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.760]   fragments of it will be on social media.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:05.120]   But I think that people don't realize
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   how compulsion inducing the dopamine circuitry is.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.520]   And once you start getting pulled down it,
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.040]   you're a different organism altogether.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.560]   And it's not a coincidence that the people
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.640]   who have the largest social media accounts
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   spend very little time on social media.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.040]   - 'Cause if you spend too much, it just gets overwhelming.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.160]   - Well, you're spending time doing things
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.440]   like commenting and liking
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.280]   and there's a liability to some of that,
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.640]   but there's a reward to it too, an immediate reward.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.920]   What you're not doing is going and doing the thing
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.000]   that you bring to social media
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.760]   that brings you more followers and views.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.420]   So I always think of social media
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.640]   as that last point in a funnel
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.080]   where I go do things in real life,
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.760]   like research papers, talk to people, learn,
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.400]   and then organize that learning into a format
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.200]   that I think people can benefit from
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.560]   and then put it on social media.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.640]   But that's the end point.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.200]   And so if I stay too long there,
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.560]   then I'm not getting more material.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.480]   It's almost like if I were a farmer,
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.680]   once the crops ship, I'm not going to stand there
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.080]   just like looking at the road as the truck goes by.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:13.920]   - You got to plow the field.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.600]   - Yeah, you got to get back and plant more seeds
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.440]   and plow the field.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.680]   I mean, so I like to think about these things
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.900]   in these very basic terms,
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.440]   because I feel that the dopamine circuitry,
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.120]   it hasn't evolved, right?
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.640]   But we have new technologies
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.540]   that have hijacked it to some extent.
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.840]   Jerry Seinfeld said one of the reason he quit his show
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.360]   in the 1990s was because what made it so good
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.560]   and so funny is that he and Larry David
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.320]   would go like sit in a deli and watch people order
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.160]   and make a joke.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.120]   That's where they got their content from
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.400]   was observing the world.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.080]   But they got so busy and so famous
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.280]   that they couldn't do that anymore.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.360]   And he knew that it was going to come
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.720]   at the detriment of the show,
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.480]   that it wasn't like the ultimate reward
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.960]   of like how big was the season?
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.080]   How many people watch the show?
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.120]   How much money do we make?
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.040]   What made them great was going out and living
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:53.880]   and doing their thing.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.680]   And once it came at the expense of that,
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.260]   it didn't work anymore.
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.240]   - Well, this raises a really key point for people,
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.200]   including myself, which is in an ideal world,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.200]   one can make a living that is sufficient for their needs,
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.000]   doing something that you truly enjoy doing.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.720]   Or I would say to be realistic,
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.720]   where 75% of the activities are pleasurable,
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:26.080]   maybe 15% are kind of neutral.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.940]   And then the remainder, there's some punishing features.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.860]   There are punishing features in every profession.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.780]   - Yes, Jeff Bezos said if you can enjoy half,
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.620]   that's pretty good.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.440]   - Okay, all right.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.020]   So I'm a little more stringent with my,
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:37.500]   yeah, I'm more of an optimist than Bezos.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.360]   Hey, I don't, but then again, he's Bezos.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.500]   Yeah, I mean, you want to be able to enjoy your work.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.820]   Not all aspects of it are going to be pleasurable,
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.980]   but ideally that's the case.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.160]   Because what we're talking about here
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.440]   is effort that precedes dopamine.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.020]   And I'm a big believer that dopamine
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:56.900]   that is not preceded by effort is very dangerous.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.340]   It's not just things that are addictive,
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.820]   but by way of example, methamphetamine, cocaine,
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:05.220]   dramatically and quickly spike dopamine levels.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.180]   - With no effort put in.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.540]   - With no effort put in.
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.420]   And then of course we know from the beautiful work
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.940]   of my colleague Anna Lembke and others,
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:13.020]   that then the dopamine profile
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.660]   is that then the higher the peak
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.300]   and the faster the rise to peak,
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.020]   then the more drop below baseline
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.860]   and the more time it takes to return to baseline.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.860]   And typically what people do is when they're below baseline
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.780]   in terms of their dopamine,
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.340]   that's when they really start hitting the hammer
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.460]   with whatever behavior or substance.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.220]   And all it does is drive that baseline
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.820]   further and further and further down.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.820]   - Maybe that's a good analogy for the lottery winner
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.620]   who gets a lot of money, a lot of dopamine in this example,
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.060]   but didn't put anything into it.
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:38.980]   You didn't build a business.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:40.060]   You didn't work at your career.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:40.900]   You just got lucky.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.820]   So it doesn't feel as good.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.800]   There's no effort put into to like base it against.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.420]   - Compare it against what you were talking about before,
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.520]   which is time that's unstructured
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.320]   with your kids playing Legos.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.700]   It's almost, it sounds effortless.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.540]   It's not like you're like,
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.840]   oh, I got to go play with my boy's Legos.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.860]   I'm sure that you're like, yes, like this is fun.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.900]   This is the good stuff, as they say.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.860]   And so there are forms of reward, it seems,
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.900]   that are not preceded by effort.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.340]   Although you had to raise those kids
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.780]   and your wife had to give birth to those kids
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.620]   and it's work.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.140]   But in terms of what's happening in that limited timeframe,
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.660]   it's just so seamless, right?
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.940]   It's just sheer pleasure.
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:17.940]   And yet that kind of pleasure is enriching.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.840]   It has me very perplexed.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.800]   As a biologist,
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.840]   I still don't know the underlying mechanisms,
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.940]   but clearly we have multiple paths to pleasure,
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.180]   but I think we have only one path for motivation
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.500]   and that's dopamine.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.700]   But I think there are multiple forms of pleasure
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.920]   and I'm certain that dopamine that is,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.780]   high levels of dopamine that are not preceded by effort
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.420]   are not just bad, they are downright dangerous.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.180]   - I feel like so much of it too with parenting.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.400]   This is a slightly different topic,
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.440]   but it's the things that you're not trying to have fun with
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.560]   that build the biggest memories.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.840]   And for me, it's when I travel with my son, he's nine.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.520]   So we go on a lot of trips now.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.260]   What's fun is not the event we're going to,
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.900]   whether it's skiing or a football game.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.940]   That's not the best part of the trip.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.520]   The best part of the trip is flying with him,
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.220]   renting a car with him, going out to dinner with him.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.760]   That's where you get all the memories.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.300]   It's like, it's a process of doing it
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.140]   that's gonna, you're really enjoying,
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.540]   that's gonna build all the memories.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.420]   Not necessarily the final destination where you're going.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.800]   - Yeah, I just wanna hover on that for a second
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.840]   'cause I can think of numerous examples in my life
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.740]   where the best parts of a relationship
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:20.700]   were like a drive home with someone where like,
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.980]   I'm asleep for part of the time,
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:23.220]   they're asleep for part of the time.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.580]   And you get back and like, you really,
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.900]   you feel like you really did something.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.300]   There's something bonding about traveling with people.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.580]   It's even in the absence of external input.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.980]   Like you're just, what is that?
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.380]   It must be something fundamental,
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.720]   some fundamental circuit about journeying
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.300]   with other members of our species.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.880]   - Going through a challenge with someone,
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.380]   going through a journey of like, we did this together.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.860]   We went through it together.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.700]   I think there's so much of that.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.060]   If you go on a long hike with somebody at the top,
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.020]   like you wanna hug each other.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.440]   Like we just did that together.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.100]   And it's not even about being at the top.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.620]   It's like the journey you did with each other.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.980]   So cliche, but I think it's true for a lot of things.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.560]   - And what's that movie with Emile Hirsch where he,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.540]   it's a true story about the guy that goes out
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:04.600]   into the Alaskan wilderness and lives on that bus.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.140]   And sadly he passes away there.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.460]   I just spoiled it for you.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.460]   But he has, I think it's called "Into the Wild."
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.380]   "Into the Wild," where he's obsessed with this notion
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.520]   of bonding with nature, but then in his journal,
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.660]   a real journal of a guy that really died out there,
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:24.660]   he gets to the realization that the fundamental pursuit
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.260]   in life is to experience things with other people.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.380]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.900]   And this is why solitary confinement is such a torture.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.940]   The extreme end of it.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.760]   - Brutal, brutal.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.880]   On the other end of the spectrum, there's freedom.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.760]   So let's talk about freedom.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.620]   - Yeah.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.520]   - It means different things to different people,
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.940]   but certainly one does not want to be enslaved by anything,
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.900]   including their own pursuit of work.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.900]   So there, I think at least two forms of anti-freedom.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.880]   One would be the type that exists within our head.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.420]   We have to continue on this track
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.720]   because I'm afraid of failure,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.940]   or I'm in pursuit of something,
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.640]   and we are actually enslaved in a way
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.940]   that we sort of create for ourselves
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.900]   in the act of pursuit.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.900]   The other is the job where it's providing resources,
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.900]   but we really don't need to be there.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.580]   And yet people don't hop off the train.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.100]   You know, they could.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.140]   They could escape the dreaded boss
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.380]   or the dreaded circumstance.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.120]   You know, I remember a time when all I wanted
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.180]   was a window at work that opened for fresh air.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:34.460]   That's all I wanted.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.420]   And like all these other things,
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.340]   I just wanted a window that opened.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.740]   I even tried to find one of these like little saws,
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.240]   but then the maintenance people or whatever,
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.740]   the facilities people told me I'd get in trouble.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:48.100]   We yearn for freedom.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.380]   We hate enslavement for all the obvious reasons.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.620]   In your observation,
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:58.620]   what is the best way to frame this need for freedom?
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.500]   And I have to imagine that people listening
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.640]   are at various points along their careers.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.220]   What have you observed here in yourself
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.340]   and with other people you talk to, wealthy, not wealthy?
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.380]   What is freedom?
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.820]   How do we get real freedom?
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.380]   - I think there's this anecdote that I love,
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.880]   which was from Franklin Roosevelt when he was a kid.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.220]   I think he was like five years old.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.540]   He complained to his mother one day.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.980]   He said, "My entire life is rules and schedules,
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.820]   and I hate it."
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.780]   So his mom said, "Okay, Frankie, tomorrow,
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.380]   you can do whatever you want.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.420]   The day is yours, anything you want."
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.900]   And his mom, Sarah Roosevelt, wrote in her diary that night.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.180]   He said that day that he could do anything,
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.660]   he went back to his normal schedule.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.100]   He did everything on schedule like he was supposed to do,
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.100]   but he was much happier
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.900]   because nobody was telling him to do it.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.540]   And I think that's what's true for a lot of people.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.180]   Freedom does not mean you do nothing.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.700]   It doesn't necessarily mean you retire.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:49.260]   It doesn't mean you quit working.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.140]   I wanna be free and independent,
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.820]   which means I wanna wake up every morning and say,
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.780]   "I can do whatever the hell I want today."
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.660]   Even if most mornings, what I wanna do is work
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.180]   and be productive and put myself to use.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.140]   So I think a lot of people misconstrue freedom
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.060]   as I'm gonna ride off into the sunset and do nothing now.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.060]   It's like, no, I think people have an inherent drive
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.940]   to wanna be productive and social and do things.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.900]   But there's a big difference
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.580]   between your boss telling you to do it
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.180]   and doing it on your own terms.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.580]   When I was a junior in college,
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.460]   like a lot of young men,
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.380]   I wanted to be an investment banker.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.420]   That's what looked like power and prestige.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.820]   So I got this investment banking internship
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.780]   and I was absolutely miserable.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.540]   They had this saying that is so funny in hindsight.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.260]   They said, "If you don't come to work on Saturday,
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.940]   don't bother coming back on Sunday."
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:34.900]   But just the culture of it was work 100 hours a week,
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.540]   just go nuts with it.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.380]   And I hated it.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.420]   I hated every single second and I had to leave.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.820]   But it wasn't because I was not into hard work.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.380]   I think I was absolutely willing to work hard.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.140]   I just didn't want anyone to tell me to do it.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   And so when I became,
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.620]   not necessarily financially independent,
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.980]   but I could have a job, it was more entrepreneurial.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.820]   It was like, oh, I will work very hard.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:56.300]   And sometimes I might work as hard as an investment banker.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.100]   I might work 80 hours a week, but it's on my terms.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.100]   And I think everyone is way more willing to do that
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.500]   than they are to be told what to do.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.300]   I think that is an inherent human driver.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.740]   And if you can use your money for independence
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.460]   to where you can wake up and say,
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.340]   I have the financial flexibility to work where I want,
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:14.300]   live where I want, retire what I want,
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.460]   take a different job, move to a different department,
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.020]   even if it's gonna pay less,
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:20.700]   that giving yourself independence and autonomy,
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.820]   I think for most people is what's gonna drive.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.300]   That's the highest tool that you can use with money.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.700]   And what's important about that is
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.620]   where do you get independence with money?
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.240]   It's the things you don't spend money on.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.460]   It's the car you didn't buy.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.740]   It's the house you didn't buy.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.200]   And most people will view that as like idle money.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.100]   You're saving up money.
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.620]   It's just sitting in the bank doing nothing.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.420]   No, no, no, it's giving you independence.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:43.680]   And once you view as like every dollar that you don't spend
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.980]   is money that you are actually spending on independence.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.860]   It's not idle.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.220]   It's giving you marginal more independence
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.780]   than you had the day before.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.580]   Then I think, to me, that's why I save money.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.100]   I'm not saving money because I'm a pessimist.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.140]   I think it's all gonna come collapsing down.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:59.920]   I'm saving money 'cause I wanna be independent.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.160]   'Cause that's what I think is gonna give me
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.020]   the most fulfillment, the most happiness.
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.740]   And that's where the savings comes from.
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:09.080]   - Wow, I think this is a super important concept.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.080]   How should the person who is,
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.060]   well, let's just say early, mid career,
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.100]   who likes what they're doing,
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.540]   but thinks that this is probably not the thing for them.
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:22.940]   I hear about this all the time.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.220]   Like, it's just like, yeah, like it's good,
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.180]   but it's a ton of work.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.860]   It's unclear how it's gonna turn out,
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.740]   but they feel like they're already on the conveyor belt.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:32.340]   There's always this question of,
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.840]   do you stay in investment banking another year
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.680]   to make a bunch of money,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.740]   and then you get out so that you then have the freedom
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.140]   to pursue something where you have more freedom?
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:43.660]   People are always playing this kind of mental math.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.860]   And I don't think there's a clear answer,
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.780]   unless, of course, you're lucky enough that,
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:48.860]   like, you fall in love with science.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.620]   I mean, I did not become a neuroscientist to make money,
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.960]   and Lord knows I didn't.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.500]   I mean, I made some, I made a living,
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.400]   but if people heard what I was making
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.420]   as a tenured 45-year-old professor
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.140]   at one of the premier universities in the world,
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.140]   where the salaries are relatively high,
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.420]   they would be shocked.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.100]   Just shocked that post-tax income
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.460]   is quite low by Bay Area standards.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.760]   - But did you feel like you had independence?
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.380]   You could teach what you want, say what you want.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.500]   There was a level of independence.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.340]   - Absolutely.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.160]   Oh, and I loved it.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.180]   And, you know, and I still teach there,
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.200]   and, you know, it's one of these things
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.820]   where I wouldn't trade it for anything.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.640]   I also, in terms of intellectual stimulation,
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.780]   in terms of being able to look to my left
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:27.340]   or look to my right and realize
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.580]   that most of the people at Stanford, students included,
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.380]   are just phenomenal.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.500]   Like their level of intellect, their drive,
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.220]   their excitement for what they're doing.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.340]   I mean, no one ends up there by accident.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.500]   So that was and remains extremely exciting.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.700]   But I think a lot of people,
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.820]   unless they find a profession that they really love,
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.700]   or there's some feature of that profession
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.780]   that keeps them, you know, looped in in a way
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.660]   that feels satisfying, the people, et cetera,
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.060]   most people are kind of thinking like,
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.900]   all right, how do I work to make a living?
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.020]   And then, you know, like, what's the exit ramp?
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.500]   People think a lot about exit ramps,
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.600]   and sometimes it's a dollar amount,
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.720]   but also it's the idea that maybe, you know,
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.860]   go work on their real love, which might be like gardening.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.700]   They want to, you hear about these sort of hobby interests,
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.540]   right?
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:17.780]   I'll go, I'll write poetry or I'll, you know, go, you know,
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.940]   ceramics or something like that.
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.440]   The things that they truly enjoy doing.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.840]   How should people optimize along those musts
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.640]   versus want-tos versus sort of aspirational goals?
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.480]   - Two things come to mind here.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.760]   One is like, most people understand inherently
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.520]   the dangers of communism or something.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.880]   If the government's telling you what to do,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.920]   when to do it, what to say, that's a bad thing.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.300]   That's going to erode society.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.480]   But a lot of those people work at a job
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.620]   where their boss tells them what time to come in,
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.440]   what to wear, what to say, how to act, whatnot.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.880]   So they really understand it fundamentally at one level,
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.360]   but they're actually doing some version.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.320]   Now companies have to manage their employees, whatnot.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.560]   It's not a knock against that,
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.680]   but I think what's really true for independents
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.280]   and people, if they eventually move on to writing poetry
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.080]   and playing in their garden, whatever it might be,
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:03.920]   is that you eventually,
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.620]   is that you leave on your own terms.
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.400]   That whatever your exit from your career was,
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.660]   was because you wanted to do it on your own terms.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:11.600]   So the thing in psychology called the peak end rule,
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.460]   where to simplify it, minimalize it,
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.840]   a lot of how you remember any endeavor that you did in life,
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.560]   a career, a vacation, whatever it is,
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.400]   is how you felt at the very end.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.880]   And for a lot of people, if you have a great career,
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.260]   you enjoyed your career, you helped people,
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.200]   you made money, your colleagues appreciated you,
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.000]   but then you got fired or your boss came to you
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.760]   and said, you're too old to keep doing this.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.640]   That's bad, you'll never recover from that.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.760]   And you compare that to the people
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.960]   who quit on their own terms.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.800]   They said, look, I'm proud of my career, but that's enough.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.080]   I'm gonna take a step back
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.120]   and pass the baton to another generation.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.940]   Those are the people who,
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:45.060]   even if they didn't really enjoy their career that much,
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.580]   will look back at it fondly,
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.320]   because it gets back to freedom and autonomy and control.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.560]   Do you leave on your own terms
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.040]   or are you forced out on somebody else's schedule?
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.240]   And so I think maximum, wherever you go in life,
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.600]   whatever you're doing, even if you're not an entrepreneur,
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.960]   maximizing for independence and autonomy
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.200]   and doing it on your own terms,
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.440]   on your own calendar is absolutely vital
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.400]   in anything you're doing.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.200]   I mean, most people are not necessarily,
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.140]   particularly as they get older,
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:11.120]   are not necessarily scared of death.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.280]   They're scared of a death, not on their own terms.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.520]   That's gonna sneak up on them
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.200]   where they're not gonna have a chance to say goodbye.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.040]   So I think that's a good analogy for a lot of these things.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.400]   We're not scared of the ultimate outcome.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.720]   We're scared of not being able to do it on our own terms.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.340]   - I once heard Ray Dalio say something along the lines of,
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.800]   you know, the first third of your life
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.240]   is spent trying to learn how to function in the world.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.680]   Then there's a kind of middle third
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.480]   where you are acquiring resources
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.760]   to be able to take care of yourself
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.600]   and people close to you.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.040]   And then in the final third of your life,
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.040]   you want to take your knowledge,
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.480]   take what you've gleaned in terms of financial
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.800]   and other types of wealth,
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.320]   'cause of course there are other types of wealth,
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.400]   and put back, you know, for subsequent generations.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.920]   It's a beautiful model, if you think about it.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.080]   - I heard it phrased as when you get older,
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.760]   you either become an elder or elderly.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.720]   You get to choose which one.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.800]   Do you wanna be an elder and help other people or elderly?
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.560]   You're just gonna disintegrate over time.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.200]   You gotta choose which one.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.320]   - Nowadays, we have both the benefit
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.480]   and the problem of people living longer
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.480]   and maintaining vigor longer and therefore working longer.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.840]   This is certainly true in academia.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.200]   People don't like to retire.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.200]   They really do not like to retire.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.440]   And I don't think it's just so they can make more money.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.280]   I think it's so they can stay intellectually active.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.280]   People get into science typically because they like learning
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.500]   or academics generally.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.480]   They have a campus office where they go to,
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.800]   and, you know, it makes them feel socially connected.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.000]   So you can understand all the reasons
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.120]   why these people in their late 60s, 70s, and even 80s,
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.160]   sometimes even 90s, continue to go to work.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.920]   It's rare for these older generations of people
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.380]   that stay in various professions
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.880]   to continue to glean resources, but it happens.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.160]   I mean, how old is Buffett?
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.560]   - 93, maybe, yeah.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.400]   - He's still investing?
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.440]   - Yeah, oh yeah, full-time.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.500]   - Okay, and presumably he's gonna use that money
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.940]   for what, either philanthropy
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.000]   or generational wealth within his family?
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:05.840]   Is that the plan?
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.980]   - He's already given away, I think, about 100 billion.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.120]   And the plan is to give away the vast majority.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.200]   I think he announced recently
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.880]   that he was gonna leave each of his kids
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.520]   a billion dollars for philanthropy,
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.480]   not for their personal use, but for philanthropy.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.080]   And the rest is all given away.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.280]   - Oh yeah, the children of the ultra-rich
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.520]   that inherit all their wealth,
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.800]   I don't know what the numbers are there.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.200]   I know a great number of them squander it.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.840]   But I also know a few examples of some
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.720]   that really make good on those incredible assets
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.840]   that they inherited and are very thoughtful,
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.180]   hardworking people.
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.020]   It does happen.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:40.940]   - There are a couple of families.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:43.200]   I think of all the big robber baron families
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.440]   of 150 years ago,
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.080]   the Rockefellers probably did it the best.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.880]   The Rockefellers still have a lot of wealth.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.760]   The Vanderbilts by far did it the worst.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.040]   They just squandered it in a couple of generations.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.660]   And this is fairly well known now,
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.740]   but it's pretty interesting.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:58.360]   The first Vanderbilt heir who did not get a trust fund
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.680]   for whom all the money was dried up,
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.360]   the first person who didn't get any money
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.720]   was Anderson Cooper of CNN.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.120]   His mother, Gloria Vanderbilt,
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.260]   was the last Vanderbilt who got a big trust fund.
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:11.960]   And Cooper, I think not coincidentally,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.600]   is the most successful
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.200]   and probably the happiest Vanderbilt heir in 150 years.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.160]   And he's talked about this.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.960]   He was like, I was the first person in my family
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.720]   who had to make a name for himself.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.100]   The fact that his last name is not Vanderbilt, it's Cooper,
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.440]   and he didn't get any money.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.420]   He was like, I had to go out and find my own way
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.840]   and find my own identity.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.440]   Whereas all of his ancestors,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.460]   their identity was you're rich from birth.
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.300]   That's your identity.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.700]   You don't need to go out and make a name for yourself.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.020]   You don't need to work hard.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:38.440]   You don't need to create anything.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.560]   All you need to do is sit here and spend your money.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.280]   And it made them miserable.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.520]   And Cooper was the first person.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.640]   Look, this is very anecdotal.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.280]   I'm not saying this is how it's going to work for everyone,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.040]   but the first person who had to make a name for himself
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.960]   and work for himself was the one who was the most successful
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.260]   and probably the happiest.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.520]   - Super important concept.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.880]   Again, incredibly important.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.720]   I think because people often will think that they,
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.040]   because they were born into families
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.740]   that didn't have a lot of money,
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:09.000]   that somehow they were given the short end of the stick.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.200]   And in some sense they were, right?
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.940]   I mean, it's one thing to grow up in a world with assets
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.300]   and another world where you don't have assets,
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.020]   but we don't often hear about the downside.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.300]   - It's hard to have sympathy for a Vanderbilt heir
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:23.860]   who inherited $400 million on their 18th birthday.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.580]   Well, they're gonna have a lot of sympathy for that, right?
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.340]   - Right, well, there's show succession, right?
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.940]   You know, it's all about the horrible interpersonal dynamics
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.020]   of people that have a lot of wealth
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:33.180]   because it's never enough
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.180]   and they self-destruct essentially.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.500]   - I think the situation is you don't have sympathy for them,
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.860]   but you should also realize that if you were in their shoes,
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.600]   you would probably self-destruct as well.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.900]   It's very difficult to do.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.300]   Once in a while, you see someone
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.980]   who is completely motivated irrespective of money.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:50.080]   You know, Mark Zuckerberg was offered a billion dollars cash
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.900]   for Facebook when I think he was 22.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.420]   And he said, "No, I don't want it, I'm gonna keep going."
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.260]   That's a ridiculously rare personality.
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.140]   And I think, you know, most people,
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.220]   if I inherited a billion dollars on my 18th birthday,
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.940]   I probably would have no motivation.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.900]   But if Musk did, if Elon Musk did,
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.100]   wouldn't slow them down whatsoever.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.620]   Jeff Bezos did, Mark Zuckerberg did.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.740]   Those are very rare people who have a motivation
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.260]   that is so detached from money.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.660]   - I wonder if it's the excesses of wealth
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.900]   that destroy people,
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:22.020]   or if it's the fact that the excesses
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.820]   take them away from the pursuit
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.340]   of what delivered the wealth in the first place.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.020]   - For a lot of those people,
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:30.580]   it's the pursuit of solving the problem that's doing it.
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.700]   And I have a good friend, Patrick O'Shaughnessy,
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:33.660]   who phrased it this way.
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.820]   I'm gonna paraphrase him, but he said,
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.220]   "If you had to describe the mindset
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.740]   of those very successful entrepreneurs,
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:43.780]   it's not driven, it's not motivated, it's tortured."
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.860]   That they wake up every morning
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:47.340]   tortured by the problems that they're not fixing,
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:51.300]   and the opportunities that they have not yet found.
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:52.980]   And there's a famous Elon Musk interview,
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.060]   I think it was on Lex Friedman,
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.980]   where he was like, "You think you wanna be me,
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.940]   the richest man in the world, but you don't."
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:59.780]   And he was like, "It's a storm up here.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.020]   It's a mess up here."
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.020]   I think that's true for a lot of people.
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.860]   My friend, David Center,
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.420]   I was a great podcast founder.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:06.260]   - I love the founder's podcast.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.100]   - He's such a good guy.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.940]   He's one of the best guys in the world I've ever met.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:13.940]   But he says of all the 350 founders that he's profiled,
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:16.460]   only one of them has he actually said,
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:17.900]   "I would want that guy's life."
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.140]   It was Ed Thorpe.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.300]   But put that aside, of the other 349,
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.900]   I think you read their biography,
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.060]   and you can say, "I'm so glad that they existed."
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.340]   By most of the time, they did a lot of good in the world.
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.140]   They created products that make us better off.
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:34.060]   And never in a million years would I want his life.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.300]   It seems miserable.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.540]   Because most of the time, the simple answer is,
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:40.460]   their financial and career success came,
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.740]   the reason they're so successful
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.660]   is because they devoted every waking second
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:46.700]   of their entire life to this one problem, this one endeavor.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.820]   And that came at the expense of their family life,
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.260]   of their health, of their mental health,
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.700]   their physical health.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.580]   And if you get a full view of their,
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.740]   it's easy to look at Musk and say,
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:57.180]   "Oh, richest man in the world, wouldn't that be fun?"
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.100]   Yeah, but it came because he's had this life
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.340]   of a singular devotion to, well, in his case,
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.780]   two or three different companies.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.540]   And I think if you take that full picture,
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:10.140]   it's less glamorous than it would seem.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.940]   And it's too tempting in life to have envy of someone
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.620]   and say, "Oh, well, I want their money.
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.100]   And I want their career and their relationship
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.220]   or their humor."
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.260]   You're picking little bits and pieces from their life,
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.460]   but it's not how it works.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.860]   You gotta take the full package.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:26.820]   And when you look at the full package of those people
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.140]   who you might envy,
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:30.420]   if you actually take a complete view of their life,
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.380]   maybe some of them you would say,
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:33.980]   "No, that is a great life," like Ed Thorpe.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   But I think for a lot of them, if you got the full view,
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.820]   you would look at it and say,
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.060]   "Oh, that's actually a lot different than I thought."
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:39.940]   I framed this one way.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:42.260]   If you look at, this is flagrantly anecdotal,
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:45.140]   but among the 10 richest men in the world,
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:48.580]   there are a cumulative 15 divorces among them.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.580]   So it's very easy, particularly for young people to say,
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.620]   "Oh, I'm jealous of that person.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.540]   I envy that person.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.940]   I wanna be that person."
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.780]   But I think for a lot of them,
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:57.300]   if you actually got a full view of their life,
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.380]   it's not nearly as good as you would think.
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:05.820]   I think people like Elon Musk, people like Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.780]   they represent these incredibly extreme examples
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.340]   that obviously most people can't even, including me,
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:18.500]   can't fathom what a day in their life must be like.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.380]   Matt Zuck, he was on this podcast,
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:24.860]   and it seems that he really enjoys doing what he's doing.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.460]   But I think for me and for most people,
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.860]   it's just so far out of the stratosphere
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:33.780]   of understanding similar to the amount of wealth
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.620]   that they've acquired.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.820]   It just sort of like, what do you even do with all of that?
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:38.220]   And people go, "Well, I'd figure it out."
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:39.060]   Yeah, I'm sure you would,
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.100]   but it's so astronomically outside the scale
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:46.260]   of one's normal kind of dopamine reward schedules
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.300]   that it's hard to imagine.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.140]   And what are you gonna do?
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.760]   Buy a plane as big as a state?
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.260]   But there's a place in between struggling
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:00.260]   to "make it" and being at that extreme
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.660]   where people hit that sweet spot.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:04.520]   And I think a lot of your work is really aimed
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.420]   at at least shining light on the possibility
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.700]   of a sweet spot, where you're doing something
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:13.660]   that you find meaningful, making sufficient income,
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.960]   that your anxiety is buffered,
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.340]   you have meaningful relationships in and out of work,
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:24.720]   and you've essentially built a "good life," right?
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.580]   I mean, I heard Naval say something recently
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:30.060]   where he said, "You know, you want resources,"
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.660]   along the dimensions I just mentioned,
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:36.660]   "a healthy, fit body, a calm mind, and a home full of love."
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:41.560]   I think that's a pretty awesome list right there.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.780]   And it's a lot of work though, right?
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:46.760]   Just to check off even one of those four boxes,
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.180]   a lot of work, right?
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.180]   - I think because money is so tangible,
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:52.460]   the counting it is so easy and so tangible
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.900]   that even if people know that,
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.580]   they're gonna put an inordinate amount of effort
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.820]   towards making more money
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.660]   at the expense of their relationships,
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.940]   their health, their children, their friends, their family,
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:02.980]   and it comes at the expense.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.060]   Because if I were to say,
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:07.260]   "How do I increase my income by 10%?"
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.500]   And it's like, "I can wrap my head around that.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.940]   "I can give you a number of what that would be
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.220]   "and how I might be able to do it."
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:13.580]   But if I said, "How do I get my kids to love me 10% more?"
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:15.720]   Like, "Ah, I have no idea how to measure that
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:16.900]   "or how to even pursue it."
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.440]   So even if I want that, because it's hard,
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.780]   it's not tangible, it's much easier to ignore
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:23.540]   and just pursue the thing that you can count,
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.380]   which is money.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.340]   - Do you have a dog?
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.580]   - I do, golden retriever.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.300]   - I was gonna say, "You want them to love you 10% more,
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:30.180]   "get them a puppy."
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.060]   But it sounds like you already did that.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.660]   I'm just, I'm only half kidding.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:37.820]   I always say that dogs are not only unconditional love,
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:42.820]   but they have the ability to give on a daily basis,
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:46.900]   multiple times per day in a way that,
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:49.460]   I mean, they give love as readily as they receive love.
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.940]   It's just like this perfect reciprocal loop.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.500]   And they're constantly in the moment.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.340]   They're just living right there.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:55.220]   This is great cartoon.
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.140]   A lot of people have probably seen it.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:00.220]   It's a guy and a dog sitting on a lake.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.220]   And the guy's thought bubble coming out of his head
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.180]   is he's thinking about money.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:04.020]   He's thinking about work.
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.300]   He's thinking about stocks.
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.260]   The dog's thought bubble is a picture of them
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.300]   sitting on the lake.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.100]   They're just, the dog's just right in the moment,
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.660]   just enjoying what he's doing right there.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.500]   I think that's like, that's my jealousy of my dog.
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.300]   When I look at her 24 hours a day,
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:18.540]   everyone will, there's a dog will recognize this.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:19.500]   They're just in the moment.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.540]   They just enjoy what they're doing,
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.380]   whatever they're doing.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.900]   Everyone, including me, is either worrying,
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:27.380]   thinking about the past or dreaming about the future.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:28.220]   - I love that.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:29.100]   What's your dog's name, if I may?
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.220]   - Lucy.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.940]   - Golden Retrievers are an amazing breed
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.940]   because they also are universally loving.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:34.780]   - Yeah.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:37.340]   - They love the person that, you know,
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:39.780]   they're owner the most,
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.420]   but they also love people that stop
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.300]   and meet them on the street.
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:43.340]   Not all dogs are like that.
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:45.100]   - The worst guard dogs in the world.
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:45.940]   You can break into your house,
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:46.860]   a Golden Retriever will just come up
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:48.780]   and wag its tail and lick you.
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.620]   - I love it.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.340]   Let's talk about this social comparison thing.
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:57.500]   I'm trying to make this practical for people
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.060]   that are both partnered and not partnered.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:05.620]   Seems to me that a lot of what I've observed
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:08.260]   in terms of people who are on the conveyor belt,
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.940]   work, work, work, work, work,
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.900]   have a picture in their mind of kind of
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.100]   where that's all going,
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.820]   when enough is enough,
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:16.900]   and when they plan to hop off or stay on
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.700]   or how late to stay.
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:20.540]   In large part based on,
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.260]   yeah, their upbringing.
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:23.940]   Yeah, kind of who they are,
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.180]   but also the messages that they're getting
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:30.220]   from typically the one other person
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.740]   that has the greatest degree of input, right?
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.140]   Like you could create a picture
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:36.620]   where the spouse in either direction
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.580]   is saying like, "We need more."
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.420]   - Right.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:40.260]   - Right?
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.460]   That changes the picture completely.
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:42.540]   - Right.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:43.940]   - Where the spouse just says like,
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.380]   "I would just like to see you more.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:47.900]   I don't need any more stuff.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.100]   I just want to see you more.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:50.820]   We want to see you more."
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.460]   These are the sorts of at-home dynamics
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:55.940]   that I think drive a lot of decisions about career,
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.820]   not just what careers to pursue,
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:59.660]   but how long to stay in,
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.020]   whether or not you try and make partner in a firm,
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.500]   whether or not your social media account
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.620]   needs X number more followers or not.
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.780]   I think to me, this is as important
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:13.500]   as the social comparison of your peers at work or online.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.460]   The messages that we receive by the people closest to us
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:20.100]   about what to be afraid of, what the needs are.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.780]   And I don't know that people have really parsed
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:26.660]   how to resolve all that,
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.500]   but I'm guessing you probably have some thoughts about this.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:30.780]   - Well, I think the balance between it is so difficult
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:32.700]   because for a lot of people who have families
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.340]   and are working very hard,
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.340]   at the core, if you said, "Why are you working so hard?"
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.380]   "Well, to make more money."
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.300]   "Why do you want more money?"
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.460]   "To take care of my family."
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.700]   Like it's for very good intentions,
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:42.540]   but it's coming at the expense of time
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:43.780]   with your family and whatnot.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.620]   So a lot of things,
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.340]   it's not that you're making a terrible decision.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.420]   You're doing what you think is right.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.260]   And then if you said,
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.060]   "Well, how much is enough to take care of your family?"
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.860]   By and large, it's a game of comparison.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.980]   The way that people lived a hundred years ago,
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.100]   what is a good life a hundred years ago,
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.620]   is a completely inadequate life today.
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.580]   Not even a hundred years ago.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.620]   You go back to our parents' generation
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:04.260]   and say in the 1950s.
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:06.340]   There is a nostalgia for the 1950s of,
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.300]   "Oh, life was so good then and so great."
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.860]   And the white picket fence and the dog
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.060]   and the stay-at-home mom.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.060]   It's a good picture.
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:15.780]   But what was the definition of a good life back then?
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:19.300]   A good middle-class life was an 800 square foot house
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.060]   with one bathroom for four people
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.020]   and camping for your annual vacation.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.900]   You would describe a life that most people would say
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:25.980]   that's inadequate today.
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.180]   That's not my definition of a good life today.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.460]   So that is shifting all the time.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.220]   And therefore you're saying like,
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.340]   "Well, how much money do you need to be happy?"
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:37.460]   The truth is I need more money than the next family,
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.300]   than the next person.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.620]   It's this continuous chain.
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.740]   And I think a lot of that is just evolution.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.180]   It's a competition for resources.
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:45.300]   And it doesn't matter how much money you have.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.580]   What matters is that you have more money
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.780]   than the next person.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.180]   That's the sad truth for a lot of this.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:52.100]   And therefore you can easily imagine a world
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.380]   in which my grandkids are earning on average
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.340]   way more money than we are today
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.660]   and have way better resources,
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.060]   better health, better technologies,
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:01.220]   and they're no happier for it.
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:03.460]   And they don't feel any more relieved for it.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.820]   They don't feel like they can scale back
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.220]   and work less for it
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:08.180]   because they're gonna be competing with other people
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:09.700]   that have all of those things.
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:11.180]   John Maynard Keynes, a great economist,
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:13.260]   very famously predicted a world
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:15.140]   where people would be working 20 hours a week
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.580]   because technology was gonna make it
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.980]   so we didn't need to work.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:19.660]   And that's not how it works whatsoever.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.140]   We are working less than we did
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:22.980]   back when everybody was a farmer,
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:27.220]   but not nearly as little as we could be
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:29.980]   if we still had the expectations of a 1950s family
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.900]   living in an 800 square foot house.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.260]   If we had those expectations,
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.420]   people could be working way less,
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:37.180]   but it's all a competition between other people.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:38.980]   So even if 100 years from now,
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:41.740]   a middle-class family is living in a 5,000 square foot house
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.340]   with a spaceship in their backyard,
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:44.580]   if that becomes the norm,
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.820]   you don't appreciate it, any of it.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:49.540]   I mean, if you took someone 100 years ago,
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:50.980]   if you took John Rockefeller,
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:52.900]   the richest man in the world 100 years ago,
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.300]   and brought him to today
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.620]   and showed him a middle-class family in America,
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.500]   he would say, "What is this, like Advil?
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.860]   "You take a pill that makes your headache go away?
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.740]   "You have sunscreen?
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:03.620]   "You just rub this on your face?
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.860]   "You don't get sunburn?"
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.420]   His jaw would be on the floor.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.980]   But nobody appreciates that today like he would
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:11.300]   because it's just commonplace.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:14.340]   Your definition of a good life is I expect to have that.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.500]   So it's always gonna be the case that
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.500]   the reason we're working hard
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:18.660]   is to take care of our family.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.300]   And what we feel like is an adequate amount
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:22.300]   is a growing level over time.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:24.660]   I should also say that that is by and large a great thing.
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:26.620]   The reason society progresses
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.460]   is because most people wake up in the morning
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:29.980]   feeling a little bit inadequate.
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:31.340]   Whatever I have today is not enough
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.100]   and I need to go work harder to get more.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.500]   That's why we have good technology
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.220]   and economic growth over time.
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.660]   So at the macro level, it's a great thing.
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.540]   That's what pushes society forward.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:43.500]   And better medical technologies, all better technologies.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.860]   But the individual level, it creates this hamster wheel
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:48.420]   of a constant feeling of inadequacy
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.100]   that we try to compensate for
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.580]   by working harder and working harder,
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:53.020]   even when it comes at the expense
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.260]   of things that should be more dear to us,
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.660]   like our friends and family and health.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:01.840]   - And with social media, we now have access to millions,
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.720]   if not billions of comparison points.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.300]   Whereas just 30 years ago, even 20 years ago,
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:10.120]   we only had access to local comparison points.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.180]   Like the people in your neighborhood
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.180]   drove certain types of cars.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:14.500]   Now online, you can see people
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.520]   that you went to high school with that have certain lives
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.660]   and their vacations that are spectacular
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.980]   relative to the ones that one typically has.
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:26.220]   I'd like to talk about this notion of social comparison
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.740]   as a function of place.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.060]   We can touch on some major cities.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.780]   We were doing this before we started recording.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.660]   It's kind of fun to do.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:36.740]   Like in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley area where I grew up,
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:43.260]   it seems like there's a high value placed
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.900]   on the people who managed to do things
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.420]   that wick out to the entire world,
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.340]   the building of companies or technologies
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.180]   that go everywhere.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.140]   It's not just because of Facebook and Instagram,
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:56.100]   it's also because of biotech,
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:58.140]   it's because of all sorts of things.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.100]   Apple, right?
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.820]   I mean, there's a whole history of that.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.940]   What would you say for like New York City?
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.700]   What is the dominant message
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:09.060]   that's being pumped into the psyche of New Yorkers?
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:11.220]   And by the way, I love New York City,
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.820]   but it'd be fun to play this game a little bit
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:15.460]   as an example and then we'll then wick it out
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.980]   to people regardless of where they live in the world.
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:18.820]   - Well, this is one of those things
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:22.060]   where what is so good and beneficial for society
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:24.580]   is what makes individuals miserable.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.180]   So I think, what is the message here in Los Angeles
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.620]   or in New York or any other big city?
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:31.980]   San Francisco, the message is waking up in the morning
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.780]   and feeling inadequate because you are surrounded
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:35.540]   by people who at least look like they're doing better
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:38.140]   than you and you say, I have to chase that person,
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:39.140]   I have to get what they have.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.260]   That is great for society.
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.460]   That's where we get new technologies,
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.020]   new innovations and growth.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.060]   The individual level, it's very difficult.
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.740]   I grew up out in the woods in Lake Tahoe.
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.700]   And in that region, if you are a dentist,
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.580]   let's say you are on top of the world,
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.060]   you are the richest guy in town,
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.060]   everybody looked up to you,
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:57.100]   you had the nicest house, the nicest car.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:00.100]   If you are a family dentist here in Los Angeles,
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.260]   you don't stick out whatsoever.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.380]   You might feel like you are so far behind
[01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:06.340]   'cause you're surrounded by legitimate billionaires.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.460]   And so I think it's interesting to ask,
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.780]   is a dentist happier in Lake Tahoe or here?
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.340]   I think it's probably in Lake Tahoe
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.540]   because your comparison group is so much less,
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:16.740]   especially back in the pre-social media days.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.660]   The states that are statistically the happiest
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:21.460]   in the United States, it's not for cities,
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.100]   it's not Los Angeles, it's not New York.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.260]   It tends to be in the Midwest where wonderful places,
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.740]   whatnot, but less competitive
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:29.980]   than the grind of the big cities.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:32.020]   And so, but that's where,
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.900]   at the individual, where are you happiest?
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:35.340]   It's where you have less comparison,
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.900]   but for society, what is better?
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:40.700]   It's when you have a huge competition for getting ahead.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.820]   So I don't know where I come down on that
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.220]   of like where I would wanna be.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.180]   Of course, I wanna be happy as an individual,
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.180]   but I wanna live in a society that is moving ahead.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.340]   And the reason it's moving ahead
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:52.940]   is because most people wake up feeling inadequate.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.060]   - You grew up in Tahoe?
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:54.900]   - Yeah.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:58.100]   - I love Lake Tahoe, but can I ask you,
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:00.340]   did you grow up being competitive
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.740]   or thinking about how well people skied or snowboarded?
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.860]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.100]   It was also, I lived in Tahoe pre tech money.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:07.980]   It's very different now
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:10.220]   'cause so much Bay Area tech money just flooded into it.
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.300]   It's its own little Hamptons now.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.020]   But back in the day, it was,
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.420]   I felt like when I grew up,
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.300]   normal people drove old pickup trucks
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:20.020]   and rich people drove new pickup trucks.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.540]   That was the difference between rich and poor.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.660]   And both in a city like Los Angeles and New York
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:26.900]   and in a social media world,
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.420]   especially it's normal people drive Honda Civics
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.940]   and rich people have private jets.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:32.660]   Like the stratification between them
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:35.180]   is just blown so far out of proportion.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.980]   I see this with my nine-year-old son,
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:39.220]   who like a lot of kids watches Mr. Beast,
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.060]   who I think is great.
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.900]   I think he's an awesome, awesome guy,
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:44.620]   but it's completely warped my son's sense of money.
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:45.540]   'Cause Mr. Beast will be like,
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.740]   "Oh, keep your hand on the table
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:50.780]   "and the last person with their hand wins a million dollars."
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:52.580]   It's like, if that's your sense of money,
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.220]   it's completely warped and skewed.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:58.540]   And so, look, it's a tough way to live.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.140]   And I think the more of that angst that people have
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.700]   of I'm inadequate, I need to get ahead,
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.260]   the better society is gonna be,
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.340]   the more technology we're gonna have.
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:08.940]   Great example of this is,
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.620]   what decades were the most technologically innovative?
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.020]   By far, it's not even close.
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:16.860]   It was 1930s, the Great Depression
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:18.660]   and the 1940s, World War II.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.700]   When society was on fire,
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.820]   that's when every business, every scientist,
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:24.540]   every entrepreneur woke up every morning and said,
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:27.860]   "I need to figure this out right now, today, immediately."
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.700]   During the Great Depression, if you were a business owner,
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.300]   it was, if I don't figure out a way
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:33.660]   to become more efficient, I'm bankrupt tomorrow.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:36.020]   So that was the birth of a lot of the assembly lines.
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:37.460]   It was the birth of the grocery store,
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.580]   the birth of the laundromat.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:39.860]   Every business got more,
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.260]   just better at what they do.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:45.540]   And the ones that didn't went out of business immediately.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.380]   World War II was, if we don't figure out new technologies,
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.380]   we're gonna lose everything.
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:53.540]   Hitler's gonna control the planet.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:56.460]   So that was nuclear energy, radar, jets,
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:59.100]   go on down the list of things that we benefit from today,
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:02.540]   happened because of that social angst that we had back then.
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.300]   And so I think there's so much evidence
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:06.820]   that society progresses when things are a little bit on fire,
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:08.060]   not too much on fire,
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:09.660]   'cause then you just get overwhelmed with it.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:11.740]   But if you have a little bit of angst of,
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.980]   "I need to wake up, I need to do this."
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:16.900]   And when societies become fat and happy and decadent,
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.620]   or when companies do this,
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.340]   companies that just are minting money,
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.860]   and there's no pressure on it,
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.780]   they have more money than they know what to do with.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.540]   That's the downfall of a lot of companies,
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.420]   Sears, IBM, Intel, Boeing,
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:30.100]   who are either not around
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.540]   or are shells of their former selves.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:32.740]   I think you can tie a lot of that
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.340]   to the success that they had in the past
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:37.100]   when there was no pressure to innovate and get ahead.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.300]   It was just a culture of,
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.740]   "We have so much lying around here
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.340]   that we can do anything that we want."
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:43.860]   I had a guy tell me one time, he said,
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.700]   "Every business should have a little bit of debt,
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:47.940]   because it keeps you in check,
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:50.140]   keeps your ambitions in line of waking up and being like,
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.180]   'No, I have to succeed this year
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.420]   because we have debt to pay off.'"
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.780]   And when you have too much freedom
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.220]   and a little bit too much autonomy,
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:59.860]   you have a higher chance of just letting it slip away.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:02.180]   What made you great when you were young
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:04.420]   and poor and broke and hungry
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.980]   slips away when the wealthier you become.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.940]   - Tell me what you think of this mental exercise.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.100]   As you're describing this to me,
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:15.100]   I'm thinking about how at different stages of my career,
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.500]   first academic science, and I still teach,
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.380]   but I shut down my animal lab,
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:21.180]   I'm still involved in some human research,
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:23.660]   but mainly focused on the podcast these days.
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:29.380]   I can look to different things around me
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:31.660]   that were the forces pulling on me.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.980]   I like to think in terms of carrot and stick.
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.500]   You know, for those that don't know what that is,
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.260]   'cause we have a lot of listeners from outside the US,
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:39.300]   carrot is the thing you're working towards,
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.980]   the enticing thing, the reward,
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:43.480]   stick is the punishment, carrot and stick.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.140]   Because frankly, that's how the brain works,
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.140]   carrot and stick, right?
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.740]   And a lot of what we're talking about today
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:53.680]   is carrot and sticks of different sizes,
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.020]   different types, et cetera.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:58.140]   For every stage of my career,
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:02.180]   graduate student, postdoc, professor before tenure,
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.580]   professor after getting tenure,
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:04.620]   it's kind of interesting concept.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:05.860]   People think of it as job for life,
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.540]   but it's really academic freedom,
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.740]   and you're still on the fundraising treadmill,
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.500]   or even as a podcaster.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.740]   You know, what the force was inside me,
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.260]   and I'm not trying to make this about me,
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.740]   I just can, I know that there are different people
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:20.280]   that I'm trying to satisfy.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:24.300]   And of course, satisfy my own curiosity and intellect,
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.060]   but there are forces, there's the,
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:27.820]   I'm part of a group, I'm part of a team here,
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.140]   I can't let them down.
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.060]   So it doesn't matter how well I slept last night,
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.580]   I happened to sleep pretty well last night,
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.020]   but it doesn't matter, I got to show up,
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:37.020]   got to suit up and show up, as they say.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.580]   Do you think it's worthwhile for people to stop
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:43.800]   wherever they are in their life arc,
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.780]   and just think about like,
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.900]   where are these forces pulling us,
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.620]   the carrots and the sticks?
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:52.740]   Because I think therein lies a lot of information.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:57.060]   Are you working for an expectation that you need to fulfill
[01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.400]   because you did it before?
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.940]   I sometimes think about professional athletes,
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:03.300]   they sometimes have a shorter professional life
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:04.380]   than in other careers,
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:07.040]   because just physical capabilities give way.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.180]   But you know, like what drives them?
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:11.780]   I often want to know like, what pulls them?
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:14.260]   Like, where do they feel obligated?
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.020]   Where, you know, not just, you know, what the drive is,
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:18.280]   but where do they feel obligated?
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.820]   Where do they feel like kind of pulled?
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:20.940]   Is it to the general public?
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.820]   Is it their parents?
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.620]   Is it their bank account?
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:25.700]   Is it the fear that they're going to have to retire
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:26.540]   at some point?
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:27.380]   Do you ever think about this kind of stuff?
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:29.060]   - I think a lot of it is tied to your identity
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.700]   of just who do you see in the mirror
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.780]   when you wake up every morning.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:34.500]   And if your identity is, I'm a professional athlete,
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.380]   if your identity is, I'm a podcaster,
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:38.680]   I am a rich person, whatever it might be,
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.060]   then that's what's pulling you.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.700]   It's that source of your identity.
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.300]   So this gets back to the Paul Graham idea
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:44.980]   of keep your identity small.
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:48.060]   I think he meant it mainly in the context of politics,
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:50.020]   of politics can just poison your identity
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:52.060]   and it really affects your thinking.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:53.960]   But keeping your identity small for a lot of things,
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.620]   I think, is a great point of view.
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:58.540]   The more you look in the mirror and say, I am a blank,
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:48:59.540]   doesn't matter what that is.
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:02.100]   I'm a professor, I'm an author, whatever it is.
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:04.500]   It's hard to give that up 'cause it's part of your identity.
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.780]   I saw this with my own dad who was,
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:08.860]   he was a doctor and he retired
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.380]   and he went back to work a year later.
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:12.800]   'Cause I think at least part of it was
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.860]   when he looked in the mirror,
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.180]   he had to say, I am a doctor, that was his identity.
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:18.060]   And when he retired, he couldn't say that anymore
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.340]   and it drove him crazy.
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:20.820]   I think it's true for a lot of people.
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.780]   Now that could be great.
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.800]   For him, it was great.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.500]   And I think for me, my identity,
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:27.820]   I think my core identity is I'm a father, I'm a husband,
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:31.060]   I hope to be a friend, but then maybe it's I'm an author.
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.420]   And if I had to give that up, it might sting a little bit.
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:34.940]   It's not maybe the core of my identity,
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.140]   but it's right there.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.320]   And I think for a lot of people, if you're successful,
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.300]   core to their identity is I'm a person
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.260]   who makes a lot of money.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:43.620]   I'm a person who makes X dollars per year.
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:45.100]   And they're unable to give that up.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:47.500]   And that again, I think if we're talking about money,
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.060]   that's when money becomes a liability
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.660]   is when it's ingrained in your identity
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.700]   and it's controlling you.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.300]   You're not using it as a tool.
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.920]   It's using you as its little marionette doll
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:57.900]   to control you every day.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:00.980]   And I think that's when a lot of people go astray
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:02.100]   with their happiness with money
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.320]   is when it starts controlling them
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.540]   because it's so core to who they see in the mirror every day.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.620]   - Yeah, that's like that cartoon of the person standing
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:10.420]   with a little cage in front of their face.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:12.200]   Like they're giving up freedom
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:14.060]   by virtue of some mental construct.
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:15.060]   - Right.
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:20.060]   - I wonder if perhaps even better than Paul's idea
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:24.220]   of shrinking one's identity to make it operational
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:25.820]   and make it verb based.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:27.020]   Because it's one thing to say,
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.180]   I'm going to not use my professional title
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:32.900]   of podcaster, professor, author, doctor.
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.260]   But if one gets to the verb function
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:37.860]   that drove the pursuit of things in the first place.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:39.060]   - I enjoy doing this.
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:40.260]   - I'm a curious person.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:44.000]   I seem to mention him all the time
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.180]   and I'm just going to do it 'cause it's my podcast.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:50.280]   Rick Rubin's a close friend
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.180]   and I feel so lucky for that friendship.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:54.080]   Of course, I love the music he's produced
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.440]   but that's not why I love the friendship.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.400]   I happen to just really think Rick's a great guy.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:00.360]   But because he's so verb and action based,
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.840]   it's about almost everything Rick talks about
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.400]   in terms of creativity and productivity
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.920]   is about discarding with titles
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.720]   and concepts of who you were before
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.320]   and just being in the verb state
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.640]   of wherever you happen to be at that point in your life
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.080]   and creating offerings.
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:18.840]   And he actually likes to remove the concept of an audience.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:21.960]   He actually talks about this is your offering to God
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.480]   and the audience may or may not like it.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.040]   But that in his words is the way to frame it
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.720]   because otherwise you end up trying to satisfy people.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.400]   And then you're no longer in the process
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.200]   of exploring your curiosity or creativity.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.560]   So yeah, I've decided at this moment
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.580]   and I'll make it, I'll put it on record
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:42.520]   that I'm not going to think of myself as a podcaster.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.440]   I mean, I did a lot of things.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.920]   I did, you know, pursued skateboarding,
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:47.000]   pursued, you know, tropical fish tanks,
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000]   pursued, you know, science and research sciences,
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.560]   teaching, which, you know, and then this,
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.380]   public education and podcasting.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:56.560]   I fully expect that in five to 10 years
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.200]   I'll be doing something completely different
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:00.640]   but it'll still be attached to the verb state
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.280]   that drove every single one of those professions
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.700]   or every single one of those pursuits.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.320]   Because as Rick's taught me,
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.380]   it's the energy that you need to continue to tap into
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:11.360]   that is self-rewarding.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.740]   The feelings of delight, of friction,
[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:16.040]   and then release when you solve a problem.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.440]   It's not really about the profession or the title
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:21.360]   or even the resources that come from that.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.720]   But that in fact, the greatest resources,
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:25.140]   in particular financial resources,
[01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.400]   coming from identifying the verb state
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.400]   of being in pursuit of something that's truly unique to you.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.060]   And that changes over time.
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:36.240]   I'm always amazed at these examples like the Warren Buffetts
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.200]   and these people have been investing their whole life.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.400]   You pointed this out in your book
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:42.240]   that one of the fundamental things
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.640]   about Buffett being so successful
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.240]   is that he's had a lot of time investing.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.140]   - He's been doing it since he was 11 and he's 93.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:51.580]   - Right, it doesn't seem like he needs another venue.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:53.040]   It seems like he's got it dialed.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:53.880]   That's his venue.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:57.040]   If he were a golfer, he'd be golfing at 93.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.320]   - Yeah, he's doing it because he loves to do it.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.980]   I think it's true for me as a writer,
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.000]   what's always been the case.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.560]   I wonder if this, I think this might really apply
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:06.680]   to your own career.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:09.280]   I've always written for an audience of one, which is myself.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.520]   I just wanna write things that I think are interesting.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.480]   I wanna write stories that I find appealing.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:16.020]   I wanna write it in a style that I would enjoy reading.
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:18.000]   And I don't care that much
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.100]   about the audience who might read it.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.560]   Of course, I want them to read it
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.840]   and maybe buy the books and enjoy it,
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:23.960]   but I'm writing for myself.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.280]   And I think you always do your best work when you do that,
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.040]   if you're writing or producing a podcast
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.640]   for an audience of one, which is you.
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:32.760]   And so I think if you're doing it otherwise,
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:35.640]   it's performative and people do much worse work.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:36.540]   They're much less creative.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.680]   They're much less enjoyable when it's performative.
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:40.360]   When you start off by asking,
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.520]   what does the audience wanna hear or see?
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:43.880]   And let's do that. - Yeah, that never works.
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.000]   - But that's what most people do.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.200]   And even what does every writing 101 teacher
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:48.040]   teach their students?
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:48.920]   Know your audience.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.800]   I don't think it's good advice
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.000]   because know your audience very quickly
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.840]   becomes pander to your audience.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:57.200]   Not just as writers, but in any form of work that you do,
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.540]   pandering to your boss, pandering to your quarterly metrics,
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.720]   whatever that might be.
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.020]   You're always gonna do your best work
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.360]   if you have the independence and the autonomy
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.840]   to have an audience of one, which is yourself.
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.640]   Brian Chesky of Airbnb talks about this.
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:11.580]   He's like, "Don't build a product that 1,000 people like.
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:13.340]   "Build a product that 100 people love
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.800]   "or that one person you love and use it."
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:17.600]   That's when you're gonna always do your best work.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.480]   You're not trying to manage a product or a book
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.700]   or a podcast towards some metric or goal.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:24.200]   You're doing it 'cause you love doing it.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.080]   Much easier said than done for a lot of careers
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.440]   because if you're working for a company,
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.040]   you do have metrics you have to follow.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.560]   You do have formulas and policies you have to follow.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:32.980]   So it's not that everyone can do this,
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:35.580]   but it's unavoidable that you're always gonna do
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.300]   your best work when it's yours
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:38.380]   and you're doing it for yourself,
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.880]   not because you're trying to reach some metric.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.820]   - I guess the phrase, you know, be a lifer.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:45.100]   I used to think that meant,
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.880]   if you were a musician, stay a musician.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.500]   If you're in finance, stay in finance.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:51.340]   But I think now I'm gonna revise that to,
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:55.740]   one wants to be a lifer at tapping into the energy
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:58.020]   of pursuing things that are really meaningful to them
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:01.500]   in that moment, in that phase of life.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:02.340]   'Cause it's so different.
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:03.200]   I mean, when I was a kid,
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:05.060]   I was obsessed with fish tanks and tropical birds
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:06.820]   and then skateboarding, punk rock music.
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.660]   And it changed.
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:09.220]   I mean, the venue changed,
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:12.560]   but we don't really change as in terms of identity
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.780]   very much, right?
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.000]   These professions and these bank accounts,
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.980]   and we don't actually,
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:20.800]   we're not fundamentally changed by them.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.320]   It's really a bunch of verb states that drive all this.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.680]   - And I actually hope that in 20 years,
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.600]   I'm doing something different,
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.360]   that I'm not writing about the same topic.
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.560]   So maybe I hope I'm still writing and thinking
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.100]   and reading and learning.
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:33.380]   But if you're always doing the same thing,
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:36.380]   I think someone like Buffett is an incredibly oddball,
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:38.540]   rare bird who's been doing the same thing for 80 years
[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:39.380]   and loves it.
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:42.360]   Like I wanna grow and adapt and evolve in what I'm doing.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.600]   But if something becomes core to your identity,
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.760]   then it's hard to release that and let go.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:48.240]   You feel like you have to keep doing it
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.680]   even when it's not that fun anymore.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.880]   And you're not getting the dopamine rush
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.360]   of trying something new.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.580]   You're attached to something,
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:56.520]   you keep being a lawyer or whatever it might be,
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.720]   because that's your identity,
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.160]   even when you don't like it anymore.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.800]   - Think about Michael Jordan playing baseball,
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:03.800]   which he did for a little while.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.640]   He wanted to play professional baseball.
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.300]   So he gave himself the shot.
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.140]   I think it's awesome,
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.120]   even though it didn't turn out as well
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:12.240]   as basketball turned out for him.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:16.360]   Because it just reflected his inherently competitive,
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.960]   high-performance nature.
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:18.800]   - I had to keep doing something.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.360]   Or Bezos, so I keep bringing it up.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.140]   But you build the biggest,
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.840]   most successful company in the world, Amazon.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.280]   What do you do in your retirement?
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.380]   You start a rocket company kind of thing.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.840]   Maybe he did, I don't know this,
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:30.720]   I don't wanna put words in his mouth.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.800]   Maybe he did get a little bit bored with Amazon.
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.720]   And it was, he needed to do something else.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:35.560]   But he's not gonna retire.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:36.380]   He's not gonna play golf.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:37.280]   He's not gonna sit on his boat.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:38.960]   He's gonna go build another company.
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:39.940]   Always have to be doing something,
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:41.640]   even if it's growing and adapting.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.200]   - You're working on a new book.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:48.600]   And I eagerly anticipate the release of that new book.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.640]   When's it coming out?
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.960]   - September, 2025.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.960]   - Okay, so we got a little while to wait.
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:55.840]   Are you willing to share a few things
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.000]   that you're thinking about,
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.400]   or that we might expect to see in that book?
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.120]   - Yeah, I think there are pieces of the book
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:04.720]   that you and I have talked about today.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.560]   The book is called "The Art of Spending Money."
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:07.840]   And I make a point of,
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:10.020]   the book is not called "The Science of Spending Money,"
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:11.920]   because spending money is not a science.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:12.880]   It's not something where you can say,
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.080]   "Here's the formula that works for everybody."
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:15.920]   It's an art.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:16.760]   And what is an art?
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.640]   It is different for everybody.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:18.720]   It's subjective.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.040]   It's often contradictory.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.500]   And I think that's what an appropriate way
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:23.840]   to spend money should be.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.880]   So at no point in the book do I say,
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.400]   "Here's how you should spend your money,"
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:29.160]   'cause I don't think anybody can accurately do that
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:30.420]   for a broad audience.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:33.280]   It's a look at the psychology of envy,
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:34.800]   of keeping up with the Joneses,
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.280]   of social aspiration,
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.320]   of identity that we've been talking about,
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.360]   managing money and kids,
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.520]   of being jealous of other people,
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.480]   of wanting to get attention for yourself.
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:46.360]   It's a look at the psychology of that
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.840]   without offering any firm, concrete advice,
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.600]   which I would say a lot of people don't like that.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:51.440]   A lot of people are like,
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:52.920]   "Well, just tell me what to do."
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.680]   But I try to make a point in the beginning,
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.240]   same with my first book, "Psychology of Money,"
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.640]   of I can't tell you what to do 'cause I don't know you.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.280]   And what's right for you is gonna be
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.720]   maybe not right for me.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:02.920]   You have to figure it out for yourself,
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.760]   but I can tell you what's probably going through your head
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:06.360]   as you're going on that journey.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.880]   I can tell you about the psychological pitfalls
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.960]   and challenges and advice that is psychological.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:13.920]   It's not what you should do,
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.280]   but here's how most people
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:17.320]   and why most people fall for envy
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.360]   and why if you understand the mechanics of envy,
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.800]   how silly it can be.
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.400]   That's what the book dives into.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:24.840]   - In a lot of ways,
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.480]   what sounds like you're describing
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.480]   is kind of identifying the sources of self-seduction
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:36.480]   where we, by virtue of social media
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.140]   or just by virtue of being human,
[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:41.860]   we compare what we have to see if it really is what it is.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:46.960]   You would think that we would be pretty good as a species
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.160]   at just experiencing things,
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:50.920]   kind of like the dog sitting next to the lake.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.480]   Given that we can understand that we have this propensity
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:57.760]   to compare and to regret things of past,
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:59.600]   but not be able to anticipate future regret.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.560]   You'd think we would be better at that,
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:02.520]   but clearly we're not.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:04.520]   - Well, I guess this gets back to basic evolution.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.760]   Evolution doesn't care if you're happy.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.920]   It cares that you reproduce and you grow over time.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.660]   That's what it's maximizing for.
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:10.500]   It doesn't really care
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.040]   whether you're having a good time during the process.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:13.880]   - Make more of yourself and take care of the young
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.160]   and then you're dispensable.
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:15.980]   - Keep going.
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:16.840]   Louis C.K. says more of me.
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.380]   That's what we're trying to do.
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:20.160]   And whether you're happy or not
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.720]   doesn't really play into the situation
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.320]   and actually might reward the person
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.840]   who is gaining a ton of resources,
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.360]   even if they're miserable in the process,
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.040]   who's making a ton of money in the process,
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.720]   even if they wake up miserable every morning,
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.880]   they're getting a lot of resources
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:34.480]   that might increase their fitness over time.
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.120]   Happiness doesn't play much of a role.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.840]   - Do you think birth rates are going down
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:42.840]   because people feel that they have to use more
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:45.920]   of what they earn for themselves
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.680]   or that it's harder to establish a relationship
[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:52.040]   to money and resources that makes them feel capable
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:53.380]   of taking care of others?
[01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:55.320]   - I think it's so complex.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.880]   It doesn't lead to simple answers,
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.080]   but I think there is a lot of evidence
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:01.080]   that what happens, why societies all over the world,
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.040]   this has always been the case,
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.800]   have fewer kids when they become wealthier
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.640]   is because their expectations for those kids go up.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.120]   So if you're living in a poor society,
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:11.160]   poor economy, or during a poor era,
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.200]   you could have 10 kids
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:14.080]   because you knew all 10 of those kids,
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.440]   or at least the ones who survived
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.360]   were gonna become farmers.
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:17.640]   That's what they were gonna do.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.280]   And that was their only hope.
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:20.360]   That was all they could do.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.240]   And you didn't need to provide a lot of resources for them.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:24.360]   If I give them basic food and shelter and clothes,
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.300]   that's all they need to become a farmer.
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:28.680]   And I think if you fast forward to today's economy,
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:31.320]   the expectations are so much higher.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.080]   You want your kid to become a PhD,
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:33.920]   to become an astronaut,
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.680]   become a hedge fund, whatever it might be.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:37.040]   And there, because of that,
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.840]   you need to provide so much more resources for that kid.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.480]   I need to foster their growth and development
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.280]   from the time that they are infants
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:46.800]   and provide them tutors and afterschool activities
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:48.200]   and maybe send them to private school
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.460]   and definitely send them to a college,
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.120]   which is gonna cost a fortune.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.360]   Because the expectations for what you need to provide
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.960]   are so much higher,
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.320]   you feel like you can only provide that
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:58.220]   to maybe one, maybe two kids,
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.700]   which would have been a couple of generations ago,
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:01.840]   three or four kids.
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:04.400]   And a couple of generations before that, 10 kids.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:06.840]   There's also a very grim statistic about it used to be,
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.320]   why do people used to have 10 kids?
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:10.720]   Because six of them died before they were five.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.640]   And so if you needed those hands on the farm,
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:14.880]   you needed to have a lot of kids
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.180]   to make sure you had a lot of teenagers
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.160]   who could help you one day.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:19.560]   And so I think we're blessed to now live in a world
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.600]   where thankfully the infant mortality rate
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.920]   has collapsed so much
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:24.880]   that we don't need to play that lottery game
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.720]   that we used to.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:29.700]   - What are you teaching your kids about money?
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:32.200]   And at what age should we start to do that?
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.920]   And for those listening who don't have kids,
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.720]   I suppose it's never too late to learn.
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:38.360]   - I think one of the points I always make
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.000]   that I've learned the hard way, parenting,
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.040]   is I don't think you need to sit your kids down
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:45.040]   and teach them about money
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.300]   'cause they're paying attention whether you know it or not.
[02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.940]   Kids are so incredibly good at learning.
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.300]   They're better at learning than adults are,
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:54.260]   particularly for things like language and whatnot.
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:56.700]   But you don't need to sit your kids down and say,
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.880]   "This is how much we spend, and this is what we value,
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:01:59.980]   "and this is why I save."
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:02.100]   They're paying attention, they're figuring it out.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.820]   Every time they hear you say, "I can't afford this."
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:06.580]   Every time we're at the store and they say,
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.780]   "Oh, look, this is on sale, let's get two of these."
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:10.740]   They're making a mental note of everything.
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.740]   Every time they hear you bicker about work,
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:14.340]   every time they hear you talk about a raise,
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.140]   even if it's just in the next room,
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:17.360]   they're piecing it all together.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:18.660]   And I don't think they even know it,
[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:19.720]   but they're so good at learning
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.240]   that they're building a mental model.
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:24.000]   And so even if you never sit your kids down and teach them,
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.760]   by the time, certainly they're teenagers,
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.640]   they know a lot about money.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.680]   And maybe some of those things are good,
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:31.200]   maybe some is bad, but they're paying attention.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.640]   And so I think the only thing you can do as a kid,
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.320]   or as a parent, I should say, is to lead by example.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.680]   'Cause we talked about this earlier,
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:40.960]   the propensity to rebel as a kid, as a teenager.
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:42.080]   You talked about the smoking ads
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:43.680]   where they just wanted to do the opposite
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:45.060]   of what everyone else is doing.
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:47.760]   I think particularly for teenagers, which I don't have yet,
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.380]   but if you sit them down and say,
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:50.540]   this is what you should do.
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.460]   You should always do this, you should never do that.
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:54.980]   Their propensity to rebel is enormous.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:56.620]   So I think, I shouldn't think it can backfire
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:57.580]   if you try to teach them.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:58.540]   I think the best you can do,
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:01.420]   the only thing you can do is lead by example with people.
[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:04.220]   One thing that a lot of, not just very wealthy people,
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.340]   but moderately wealthy people will say is,
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:08.540]   or ask is, how do I teach my kids
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.660]   about money without spoiling them?
[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:12.660]   How do I use my money to help my kids without spoiling them?
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:14.240]   That's a big topic for a lot of people.
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:16.640]   Even if you're like a middle-class family,
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.080]   how do I leave a small inheritance or help my kids?
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.080]   Should I buy them a new car
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:22.680]   or should I help them through college?
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.600]   I think a big thing that is easy to overlook is two things.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.720]   You might think as a parent
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:31.040]   that you are teaching your kid grit and independence
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:34.080]   by withholding resources from them.
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:35.680]   And you're doing it very well intentioned.
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:37.880]   You need to earn your iron, my money, and this is mine.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:39.440]   You gotta go figure out your own.
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:42.240]   I think it is very easy to overlook
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.920]   that you are not teaching your kid independence and grit.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:46.800]   You're teaching them to resent you.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:49.200]   And I have a good friend, Chris Davis, who told the story.
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:50.340]   Now, he's an extreme example.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:52.600]   Chris Davis's grandfather is Shelby Davis,
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.880]   who was a billionaire investor,
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.920]   one of the greatest investors of all time.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.320]   And Chris tells a story that when he was a kid
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:00.280]   and his grandfather took him skiing,
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.760]   his grandfather would say,
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.400]   "If you want me to buy you a Lyft ticket,
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.980]   "you need to hike up the hill first and ski down,
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:06.960]   "hike to the top.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.240]   "And if you do that, then I'll buy you a Lyft ticket."
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:12.920]   And Chris said, the lesson that they learned from that
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.600]   was not grit and independence and hard work.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:16.680]   The lesson they learned from it
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.040]   was grandpa's kind of a jerk sometimes.
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:20.800]   And I think that's an extreme example,
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:22.480]   but you see that a lot with kids.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:24.280]   One like very practical takeaway from this
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:25.640]   is that I think as a parent,
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:27.920]   you have to live the same lifestyle as your kids.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:30.360]   It's very difficult to say mom and dad fly first class,
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.360]   but you're back in coach.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:32.640]   - Does anyone actually do that?
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.880]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:37.580]   And maybe that's still a very extreme example,
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:41.040]   but you think as a parent that the kid is learning is,
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.940]   "Oh, if I work as hard as mom and dad,
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:44.540]   "one day I'll be sitting up there."
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.380]   And they don't.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:47.200]   The lesson they learn is mom and dad
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.720]   think they are superior to us,
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:50.600]   or mom and dad are superior to me.
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:52.120]   I'm inferior to them.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.160]   I think this is why you see a lot of very wealthy kids
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:55.920]   who are just psychologically broken,
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.440]   because I think you have well-meaning parents
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:00.600]   who are like, "Look, we're very wealthy, but you're not.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.880]   "You gotta earn your way."
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.800]   And all the kid hears throughout their life is,
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:06.320]   "I'm inferior, I'm inferior, I'm inferior, I'm inferior."
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.060]   And by the time they become adults,
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:09.580]   it's so ingrained into who they are
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:11.020]   that they can't take a step forward.
[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:13.060]   They can't advocate for themselves.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.620]   And so, look, that's what the very wealthy deal with,
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:18.340]   but I think that's what I think a lot about with kids.
[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:19.540]   The other thing that every parent
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:23.400]   with more than one kid will understand and recognize is,
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.720]   my two kids could not be more different.
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:28.380]   Their personalities, their goals.
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:31.220]   Even with the same parents living under the same roof,
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:33.500]   they are a million miles apart.
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:36.220]   And so, if you say, "What are you teaching your kids?"
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:38.700]   I don't know who they're gonna be when they grow up.
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:39.540]   I don't know what their goals
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:41.060]   or their aspirations are gonna be.
[02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:43.480]   So, is it right for me to tell my daughter like,
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.960]   "Oh, here's how you can save
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.500]   "and become super wealthy over time."
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:48.100]   What if she doesn't wanna live that life?
[02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:50.220]   What if she does have more of a YOLO personality of like,
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.800]   "Oh, I just wanna go travel the world.
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:53.780]   "I have no aspirations to become super wealthy
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:55.500]   "and retire early."
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.820]   So, you have to let them figure it out for themselves
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:00.380]   and realize that what might be right for you
[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:02.260]   and what may have been right for the era
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:04.980]   in which you and I grew up in might not be right for them
[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:07.820]   and might not fit the era that they grew up in.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.140]   - I like this saying,
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:12.780]   "None of us know what it's like to be,"
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:15.300]   you know, pick an age, "13 years old in 2024."
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:18.340]   We think we do because we were 13 years old at one point.
[02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:22.140]   Your earlier descriptions of depriving kids
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:25.580]   of the first-class ticket, putting them in coach
[02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:28.300]   and the parents flying in first class,
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:31.240]   it makes me realize that we like to think
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:35.120]   that those sorts of things will drive integration
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:35.960]   of the lesson.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:38.620]   But each one of your examples pointed to the fact
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.320]   that kids are integrating based on the emotion
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.560]   they experience at the time.
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.360]   They're not thinking about the larger lesson.
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:46.440]   - No, they're in their moment.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:49.360]   - They're thinking, "I'm hiking up this hill and this sucks."
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.760]   And they're not piecing together things over time.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:53.080]   Like, "Okay, I'm doing this
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:55.280]   "and he's trying to teach me a lesson."
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:57.080]   It's really, they're very attached
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.200]   to their immediate feelings.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.360]   - Right, and maybe it would be different
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:00.640]   in Chris Davis's example
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:02.540]   if the grandpa hiked up the hill with them.
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:03.720]   'Cause then the lesson you're taking is like,
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:05.200]   "Oh, we're gonna do this together."
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.160]   And that is teaching the value of hard work.
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.160]   "I'm gonna do it with you.
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.440]   "I'm gonna suffer with you."
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.960]   So leading by example rather than by humiliation,
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:13.800]   I think is the way to do it with kids.
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:17.640]   - When I was a kid, my dad used to walk me
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:19.000]   to this point along our street
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.960]   where then he would split off to go to work.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.120]   He was a scientist.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:23.120]   He would go to his laboratory
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:26.400]   and I'd go off to kindergarten and first grade.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:29.920]   And I remember one day asking him what he did for a living.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:31.760]   And he's a physicist.
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:33.840]   And he said, "Well, I'm a physicist."
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:34.680]   And I said, "What's that?"
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.720]   And he explained a little bit about what it was.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.960]   And I'll never forget, we still talk about this.
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:40.500]   He and I, I'll never forget.
[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:42.760]   I said, "Do you like it?"
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:44.920]   And he said, "Well, you know that feeling
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:47.240]   "the night before your birthday?"
[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:48.080]   I said, "Yeah."
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:51.160]   And he said, "I feel like that every day."
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.440]   And then I think he also said,
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.400]   and I'm still a little bit murky on this one.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.240]   I need to touch base with him about this sometime again soon.
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:00.560]   But he said, "Yeah, you don't always get presence.
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:01.540]   "It doesn't always work out.
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.660]   "But the feeling that you might
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:04.840]   "or that you're likely going to,
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:08.440]   "or there's a possibility, that just feels so good."
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.440]   And I think I must've internalized that lesson
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:12.360]   because what I like is work.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.560]   I don't think I'm addicted to work,
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:15.800]   although some in my life have accused me of that.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:17.840]   And I'm willing to be open to that possibility.
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:19.960]   But it wasn't even really about discovery.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:22.240]   It was about the possibility of discovery.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.880]   And so I think in terms of teaching to kids
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:29.700]   and teaching to peers and teaching among humans,
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:34.000]   getting people to think about the verb states
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.320]   that really motivate them from the best place
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:38.440]   seems to be the kind of general theme
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:40.720]   throughout today's discussion and in your book somewhat.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:43.240]   I'm not trying to summarize to find a point here.
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:45.280]   But if I may, it seems like,
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.120]   and what Rick Rubin has said about,
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.360]   he has this like just supernatural track record
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:53.560]   at bringing out the best creative elements in people
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:54.820]   from different genres of music.
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:57.080]   It seems to be about tapping into these verb states
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:00.160]   of like what is the thing that brings out your best
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:01.640]   as opposed to thinking about the rewards
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.960]   that come from that.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:04.360]   But it's hard, right?
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:05.520]   We see those numbers.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:08.000]   We see those, the followers, the dollars, et cetera.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.740]   We see the metrics of comparison.
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:11.200]   It's tough.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:13.880]   There's a work to this that is not obvious.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:15.040]   - I think it will always be like that.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.600]   We're never gonna live in a world
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.400]   where people don't compare themselves to others.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.440]   We're never gonna live in a world
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.120]   where people don't feel inadequate to others
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:23.040]   who have more than them.
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.320]   But back to kids.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.120]   I think this is a great place to tie us together.
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:29.320]   If you ask most parents, what do you want for your kids?
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:31.400]   Most parents will say, I just want them to be happy.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:33.200]   I just hope, I hope they're happy one day.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:34.760]   And then if you said, well, do you hope
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:37.080]   that your children are rich and successful?
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:40.160]   Parents might say like, yeah, but mainly just happy.
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:41.360]   Like, I just want them to be happy.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:42.200]   Regardless of what they're doing.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.580]   If they're a kindergarten teacher, I want them to be happy.
[02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:47.320]   And I think the parents themselves say that
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.760]   because they haven't done that themselves.
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:50.920]   Because the parents themselves have chased money
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.600]   over happiness and they see the downside of it.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.280]   And that's very common.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:58.360]   And that's why they say, I hope my kid does this
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.200]   because I haven't done a good job of that myself.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:01.760]   Because the temptation is to do that,
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.080]   is to pursue something that's not gonna make you,
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.680]   is going to make you richer, but not necessarily happier.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:09.740]   Now, that's not an argument against money or working hard,
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:10.600]   which I wanna do.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:11.920]   I wanna work hard and make money
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.720]   and have more money, of course.
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:15.880]   But I think there's such a stark difference
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:18.660]   between using money as a tool to make yourself happier,
[02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:21.440]   versus as a yardstick to compare yourself against others by.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:24.380]   And so much in the modern world is the latter.
[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:26.320]   We're not using money to make ourselves happier,
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.620]   or freer, or more independent, or to sleep better,
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.520]   or to spend more time with the people we enjoy.
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:33.240]   We use money to measure ourselves against other people.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.760]   It's just, do I have more than you?
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:35.880]   Is my car faster than yours?
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:37.560]   Is my house bigger than yours?
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.620]   And all of that is completely separated
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:41.760]   from what we actually want, like for our kids
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:43.080]   and ultimately for ourselves, which is,
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:46.080]   can I use this to become happier and live a better life?
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:49.740]   What a wild concept, but it seems just spot on.
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:55.940]   So we need to think about money a little differently,
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:00.940]   or a lot differently, if we are to get the most satisfaction
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:02.940]   from our work and from resources.
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:04.380]   - It requires a lot of looking in the mirror
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:06.340]   and just saying like, who am I and what do I want?
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:07.660]   I think that's the biggest thing,
[02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:09.860]   particularly when we started this conversation
[02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:11.220]   by saying everybody's different.
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.260]   What's right for me is not right for you.
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:15.660]   Inherent in that is that you have to understand yourself.
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:17.900]   And a lot of people, a lot of financial damage is done
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:20.220]   when people have a financial plan
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:23.300]   that is right for another person, but it's wrong for them.
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:25.940]   And that's dangerous because it's the right financial plan,
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:27.100]   maybe for a lot of other people.
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:28.020]   So it makes sense.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:28.860]   It's rational.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.680]   It makes sense on paper, on the spreadsheet it looks good,
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.080]   but it doesn't fit your personality.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.860]   That's when a lot of damage is done.
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:35.060]   So I think to do better with money,
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:38.380]   you need to spend a lot of time thinking about who you are
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:41.220]   and your family and your goals and your aspirations,
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:42.900]   realizing that all those things will change
[02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:44.140]   and adapt over time.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:45.360]   So what was right for you 10 years ago
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:46.920]   might not be right today.
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.580]   And in a way that might seem selfish,
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:51.180]   like tuning out the rest of the world
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:52.900]   and tuning out other people and coworkers
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:55.800]   and neighbors and whatnot, just saying,
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:57.900]   how can I use this as a tool to become happier,
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:59.180]   to live a little bit better life?
[02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:02.020]   Like what's the purpose of money if it's not that?
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:02.860]   - I love it.
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:05.500]   Well, Morgan, thank you so much
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.780]   for doing the work that you do.
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:09.780]   It's an incredibly unique perspective
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:13.860]   on this thing that we all have to deal with, grapple with,
[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:18.540]   and hopefully can develop a symbiotic relationship
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.620]   with money.
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:22.300]   And it's clear from talking to you today
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:23.440]   and also from reading your book
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:27.260]   that there's a strong central cord of benevolence
[02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:28.700]   in all of this.
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:29.940]   I don't know if that was your intent.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:32.620]   It seems to just come through in who you are.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:35.500]   But when I read your book and as we talked today,
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:38.780]   it's just so clear that you want the best for people.
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:41.620]   So I think that's an important thing to highlight
[02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.260]   because there are a lot of people out there
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:44.860]   telling people how to make money,
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.500]   what to do or not to do with their money,
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:49.340]   but you're telling us how to live more meaningful lives,
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:52.140]   which is something just in order of magnitude
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:52.980]   more important.
[02:12:52.980 --> 02:12:54.880]   So for that and the work that you've done
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:55.720]   and that you're doing,
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.260]   I'm eagerly anticipating your book next September.
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:01.080]   And for coming here today to educate us,
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:02.300]   thank you ever so much.
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.140]   - This has been so much fun.
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:04.540]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:05.380]   - Thank you for joining me

[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.460]   for the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:45.940]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:47.740]   I do read all the comments.
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:48.860]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:13:48.860 --> 02:13:50.060]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:51.680]   It's my very first book.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.100]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:55.240]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body".
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:56.420]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:57.560]   for more than five years,
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.900]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:01.420]   of research and experience.
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:04.500]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
[02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:06.980]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:09.420]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:12.820]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:14.900]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:18.780]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:21.140]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.940]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:24.700]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:27.420]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body".
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.420]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:32.320]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:35.300]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.080]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.220]   And on all those platforms,
[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:40.340]   I discuss science and science related tools,
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:41.860]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.300]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:45.380]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:46.680]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:50.340]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:51.540]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:53.080]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:54.600]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.580]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.980]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.180]   as well as protocols in the form of brief,
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.160]   one to three page PDFs.
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:04.060]   Those one to three page PDFs cover things
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:06.660]   like deliberate heat exposure, deliberate cold exposure.
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:08.740]   We have a foundational fitness protocol.
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:11.100]   We also have protocols for optimizing your sleep,
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:12.380]   dopamine, and much more.
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:14.740]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:17.840]   Simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab,
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:20.180]   scroll down to newsletter and provide your email.
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:22.540]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:23.900]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:26.460]   for today's discussion with Morgan Housel.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.660]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:30.760]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:33.340]   [upbeat music]
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:36.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
