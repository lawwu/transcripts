[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:54.180]   that all of us have that kind of basic intuition when the line is crossed. It's the same thing for like pornography. Yeah. You know when you see it. I think there's the same level of intuition that should be applied across the board here.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:02.540]   Um, and it's when that intuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society. That's when it starts to feel like censorship.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:10.140]   Yeah, I mean people find it a different thing. Um, you know, someone loses their job simply for their political opinion, even if that employer has every right to do it.

They have every right in the world and I'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't fire someone for their political opinion, but think that through like what society do we want to, what kind of society do we want to live in and it's been funny watching, you know, and I point this out, yes, I will defend businesses first amendment rights of association to be able to have the legal right to decide who works for them.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:12:03.900]   Um, but from a moral or philosophical matter, if you think through the implications of if every business in America becomes an expressive association, in addition to being a profit maximizing organization, that would be a disaster for democracy because you would end up in a situation where people would actually be saying to themselves, I don't think I can actually say what I really think and still believe I can keep my job.

[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.220]   Which is a set of questions.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:55.020]   Maybe you can elaborate on what the perfect rhetorical fortress is.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:01.560]   So the perfect rhetorical fortress is the way that's been developed on the left
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.380]   to not ever get to someone's actual argument.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:07.500]   I want to make a chart, like a flow chart of this,
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.580]   about like, here's the argument,
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.900]   and here is this perfect fortress that will deflect you every time you say it.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   I want to make a chart, like a flow chart of this,
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   Here's the argument, and here is this perfect fortress that will deflect you every time you say it.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   I want to make a chart, like a flow chart of this,

[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   I want to make a chart, like a flow chart of this,
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:11.900]  ,
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:41.920]  .
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   It's the only way you can get the argument.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   It's the only way you can get the argument.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   It's the only way you can get the argument.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   And I started to notice this certainly when I was in law school,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   And I started to notice this certainly when I was in law school,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   And I started to notice this certainly when I was in law school,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   And I started to notice this certainly when I was in law school,

[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.960]   I feel like if you, if you gave one of these things to Richard Feynman,
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   he'd be like, he would tear it to pieces.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   And then not get the job.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:27.960]   Yeah, there's some element of it that creates this hard to pin down fear.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   So you said like the firing,
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   the thing I wanted to say is firing a hundred people or two hundred people.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   Yeah.

[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.040]   the other thing that I think is very important is that, you know,
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.040]   you know, there are a lot of different cases that are, you know, afraid for the jobs and a lot of different cases.

[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:00.960]   I'm in the rest of compassion and
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:00.960]   I'm in the rest of compassion for another human being you have to have to have 90% compassion and
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:30.980]   And that takes just a huge amount of effort but I don't know if there's thoughts you have about this how to handle speech in a way without censoring bringing it to the surface but in a way that creates more love in the world I remember Steve Bannon got disinvited from the New Yorker festival
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:47:01.000]   and Jim Carrey freaked out and all sorts of other people freaked out and he got disinvited from from the and I got invited to speak on Smirconish about this and I was saying like listen you don't have people to your conference because you agree with them like that's we have to get out of this idea that that's because they're trying to make it sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon like that's nonsense like if you actually look at the opinions of all the people who are there you can't possibly endorse a Steve Bannon because they're trying to make it sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:01.000]   You can't possibly endorse a Steve Bannon because they're trying to make it sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:01.000]   You can't possibly endorse a Steve Bannon because they're trying to make it sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon

[02:11:52.240 --> 02:12:20.140]  Ð»ÐµÐ½ing bias on the editors of Wikipedia. So for that, what happens is on articles, which I mostly appreciate that don't have a political aspect to them, you know, scientific articles or technical articles. They're going to be really strong. Even history, just describing the facts of history that don't have a subjective element strong. Also, just
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:20.140]   using my own brain, I can kind of see where this is going to go.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:48.080]   filter out if it's, uh, you know, if it's something about January six or something like that, I know I'm going to be like, I'm not whatever's going on here, I'm going to kind of read it, but most I'm going to look to other sources. I'm going to look to a bunch of different perspectives on it's going to be very tense. That's probably going to be some kind of bias. Maybe some wording will be such which is one word. This is where we Wikipedia does this thing. The way they word stuff will be by it.
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:13:18.100]  , the choice of words, but the Wikipedia editors themselves are so self reflective. They literally have articles describing these very effects of how you can use words to inject bias in all the ways that you talked about it. That sounds healthier than most environments. It's incredibly healthy, but I think you could do better. One of the big flaws of Wikipedia to me, that community notes on X does better is the accessibility of the

[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:17.980]   I am thinking that your cause is social justice in many cases can lead people to think I can be as cruel as I want in pursuit of this. When a lot of times it's just a way to sort of vent some aggression on a person that you think of only as an abstraction.
[02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:30.920]   So I think it's important for people to realize that whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you want to put out there.
