[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   We come this evening in our consideration of the Epistle to the Romans to the verses
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.920]   20 and 21 in the fifth chapter, the fifth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.080]   verses 20 and 21.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:33.440]   Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound, but where sin abounded, grace
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.940]   did much more abound.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.520]   That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.600]   unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.200]   Now these two great verses come here at the end of this chapter, and, as you see, at the
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.560]   end of this most important and interesting paragraph, which we have been considering
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.440]   together for many weeks, the paragraph which starts at verse 12 and goes on here right
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.000]   to the end of chapter 21.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.560]   Now the very word "moreover" at the beginning of verse 20 arrests our attention at once.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.000]   Here is obviously something additional.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.360]   "Moreover"—in addition.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.040]   Now why does he say this?
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.220]   Well, let's put it like this.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.500]   You remember that last Friday evening we were indicating that verses 18 and 19 rarely sum
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.820]   up the big argument which the apostle was concerned to put before us.
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.140]   "Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.980]   by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.900]   Therefore, as by one man's disobedience many were constituted sinners, so by the obedience
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.740]   of one shall many be constituted righteous."
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.180]   That was the big thing that he was anxious to say.
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.580]   In a sense, he has really finished his statement and his argument there at the end of verse
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.580]   19.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.380]   But he goes on, "Moreover."
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.660]   He has got something further to say.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.020]   Now what is it and why does he say it?
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.220]   Well, this is very typical and characteristic of the great apostle.
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.620]   He has a feeling, obviously, that he has left a kind of loose end, and his feeling is that
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.100]   he can't just leave it like that.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.980]   He has made a reference, you remember, in the fourteenth verse—indeed, in the thirteenth
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.860]   verse as well—to the law.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.780]   Sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed where there is no law.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.860]   Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.820]   similitude of Adam's transgression.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.540]   So what he is now doing here is he just wants to round off what he has been saying about
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.160]   the law.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.100]   So he adds a kind of postscript.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.860]   He is really finished, but this is a kind of postscript.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.900]   Now then, he says, "If any of you are in trouble about this, this is what I've got
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   to say.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.660]   And there is no doubt at all that there were large numbers who were in trouble.
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.140]   The Jews were in great trouble about this.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.340]   When I say the Jews, I don't mean only the unbelieving Jews.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.180]   I mean partly also the Jews who had actually become Christians.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.660]   It took them a great deal of time to understand exactly the whole position of the law in this
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.900]   great economy of God, in this great plan and purpose of salvation.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.420]   And the apostle, who first and foremost was always a pastor, and who wrote all his letters
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.300]   not to write theological treatises, but in order to help simple people to understand
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.740]   their faith, he always takes this extra trouble to explain things to them in order that they
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.780]   should be perfectly happy in their minds.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.340]   In other words, he knew perfectly well that in view of what he'd been writing, certain
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.380]   people would get up and say, "Very well, in the light of what you say, what was the
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.980]   object or the purpose of God in giving the law at all?
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.100]   Because as we understand your argument, the law has no value.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.460]   Here you are," they seem to say to him in effect, "You've taken the whole of the
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.420]   first four chapters that you've written to tell us and to repeat it constantly that
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.740]   the law is not the means of our justification."
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.700]   "All right," they say, "we seem to be clear about that.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.140]   We thought that we could justify ourselves by keeping the law, but now you've established
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.260]   it and you've emphasized it and underlined it that no man can be justified by the deeds
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.260]   of the law."
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.620]   "Very well, then the law wasn't given in order that we might be justified."
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.740]   But now they say you've gone further.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.260]   In this paragraph, beginning at verse 12, you're now even saying that it isn't the
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.020]   law even that condemns us.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.700]   Well, what is the object and the purpose of the law?
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.300]   You've convinced us it isn't a justifier?
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.260]   Well, then we thought, well, probably then its function is to condemn us.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.300]   But here you've been telling us that it isn't, because you have been at pains to
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.580]   say this, that we're all condemned by the one sin of Adam.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.940]   It is by the one man's disobedience that many were constituted sinners.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.060]   It is because of the offense of this one man that judgment came upon all.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.780]   The law doesn't justify us.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.980]   The law doesn't even condemn us.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.020]   Well, what does the law do?
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.300]   Does it do anything at all?
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.420]   Is there any point in the law?
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.420]   Is there any purpose?
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:27.740]   Now, you can see what an acute question this must have been to the Jew, because to him,
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.460]   you see, the law that was given through Moses was the great thing.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.080]   It was such a momentous thing, the giving of the law.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.820]   It was the thing that had really marked them out from all the other nations who hadn't
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.220]   got the law in this way.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.660]   And here comes a teaching which seems to tell it on the surface to say the law is of no
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.300]   value at all, neither justifies nor condemns.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.180]   Now that is a perfectly good question, therefore, to ask.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.020]   What is the purpose and the function of the law?
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.060]   Now, you see, the question arises because Paul has really been pressing this matter
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.180]   in verses 13 and 14.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:12.220]   He says, "Until the law," that's to say, before the law did come through Moses, "sin
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.720]   was in the world."
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.680]   Not only that, death reigned from Adam to Moses before the law was ever given.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.860]   So that it's perfectly clear that the human race was condemned not by the law that was
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.140]   given through Moses, because the condemnation was already here.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:39.340]   It's proved by the universality of sin and death from Adam to Moses.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.960]   So that this question does, I say, arise in a very pertinent manner.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.860]   And it is very important that we should know the answer to the question.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.460]   And thank God, I say, the great apostle does deal with it.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.460]   And I'll take that up in a postscript.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.220]   Moreover, I haven't forgotten about it.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:07.100]   But you see, he had a certain amount of interest in style after all.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.900]   He's already had his parentheses, we've seen, in verses 13 and 14, and that even led to
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.860]   a second one in verses 15, 16, and 17.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.540]   And he seems to say to himself, "Well, there's a limit even to the number of parentheses.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.260]   I can't give yet another."
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.820]   So he finishes his matter and decides, "All right, I'll take that up in a postscript."
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.020]   And here he does so in verses 20 and 21.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.060]   I don't know about you, my friends, I must confess I am charmed by this man in everything
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.100]   he does.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.280]   I admire his method.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.060]   I like his style.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.820]   I like his way of doing things.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:52.020]   But particularly, I say, and above all else, I admire his great pastoral heart.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.320]   You haven't got a teacher here who avoids difficulties.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.500]   He doesn't leave out difficult passages, this man, and simply deal with things that are
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   easy and simple.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.540]   No, no.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.340]   He wants to help the people.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.900]   And having set himself up as a teacher, he must teach, and he must give them an explanation
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.260]   of this matter.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:16.980]   And here he is doing it in his customary and characteristic manner.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.260]   Very well, then.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.260]   What does he say?
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.340]   Well, let me take it up as a subject.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.980]   What is the function of the law?
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.660]   That's what he is really telling us here in these two verses.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.140]   Now the law, let's be quite clear about this.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:40.300]   The law in this verse 20 means the law that was given through Moses, the law that was
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.100]   given there on Mount Sinai.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.820]   Very well, that's an important point.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.660]   That's what's involved, all that was involved in the law of Moses, not only the moral but
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.380]   the ceremonial, the whole of the law.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.540]   That's what he's discussing.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.540]   Now why is it important that we should look at this?
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:10.140]   Why can't we skip over verses 20 and 21 and really at long last get to chapter 6, which
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.580]   is of course the interesting chapter, and then chapter 7 and chapter 8?
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.100]   Need we stop with these two?
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.780]   Well, I suggest that we must for this reason, that you can't understand the New Testament
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.060]   really unless you understand this whole question about the law.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.300]   You notice how often it comes in.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.700]   Take that third chapter of Galatians, out of which I read a section at the beginning.
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:40.300]   Now the law keeps on coming in the whole time, and no Christian can read his New Testament
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:47.260]   intelligently and understand its teaching unless he knows exactly what the apostle is
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.980]   talking about at this point.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.020]   It has a relevance therefore for us.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.380]   And so we really must examine it.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.740]   Now then, what does he say?
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.740]   What is the business of the law?
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.820]   It isn't to justify us.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.300]   It isn't even to condemn us in a fundamental sense.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.900]   What then is its function?
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.260]   Well here's his answer.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.820]   Moreover, he says, the law entered.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:23.140]   Now here's an interesting word, and every word that he uses has got to be watched.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.780]   We've found this word "entered" before, haven't we?
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.340]   Do you remember it in verse 12?
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:35.500]   "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin."
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.500]   Right.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.620]   Here he says, moreover, the law entered.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.740]   Now here in the authorized version we've got the same word.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.900]   It's the same word "entered" in both cases.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:55.460]   But you know the apostle did not write exactly the same word.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.700]   In the two places.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:06.020]   The difference is this, that here in verse 20 he has added a prefix to the word which
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.180]   he used in verse 12.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.660]   By one man, he says, sin entered into the world.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.740]   Here the law entered.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:21.220]   The same word, but before you come to the word, a prefix, "para."
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:27.860]   Para means alongside of, by the side of.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.260]   So that this is a bigger word and a more comprehensive word.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.740]   It is telling us more than the word in verse 12.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.500]   In verse 12 he says that sin entered into the world.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.620]   He's saying here that the law entered in by the side of.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.620]   By the side of what?
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.540]   Well, by the side of the sin that had already entered.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.700]   One thing has come in, and there it is.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.980]   Now something else comes in by the side of it.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:59.580]   Now it's most important that we should grasp that and really lay hold on it with our minds.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.220]   He means, therefore, that something has been added.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.060]   There was a state of affairs already existing, ah yes, but into that situation something
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.060]   else comes.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.300]   It isn't so much that it's creating a new situation.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.740]   It comes in alongside of the situation.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.060]   That's the principle that we've got to understand.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:30.140]   And at once we are already more than halfway to an understanding of the function of the
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.700]   law.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:43.220]   The very word that he puts here, "added alongside," tells us that the law in and of itself is not
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.460]   something that is of fundamental importance to us.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.540]   It is something additional.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.140]   It is something that has come in for the time being, put alongside of, for a particular
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.140]   function.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:03.700]   It isn't a fundamental thing in the sense that sin is fundamental and salvation is fundamental.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:10.100]   It's something that comes in, some addition, something that comes in alongside of.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:16.340]   Now, this word is a word that the apostle uses in another sense.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:23.020]   He talks in the epistle to the Galatians of some people that have crept in privily.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.680]   You'll find it in the fourth verse of the second chapter, and that because of false
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.700]   brethren unawares brought in who came in privily.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.140]   Now, it's exactly the same word.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:39.020]   Well, we don't want to add the idea of privily at this point, but it's the same general
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.380]   meaning.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:46.220]   It's not something fundamental, not something that is essential.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.620]   It has a function, but it isn't one of those fundamental things.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.580]   Now then, the law entered, came in alongside.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.260]   That's, I say, the key to the understanding.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:06.420]   Well, it came in alongside, he says, in order that the offense might abound.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.740]   Now, what's the offense?
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:13.460]   Well, it is partly Adam's offense, but it isn't only Adam's offense.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.780]   It is everything that has come out of Adam's offense, and that, as we've already seen,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:24.900]   includes our offenses also, because he has told us, hasn't he, in verse 16, that the
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:30.940]   free gift is of many offenses unto justification.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:39.180]   So when he says the offense might abound, he means the sin of Adam and all the sins
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.780]   of men ever since.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:49.260]   Very well, the law has come in alongside in order that this sin, these actual sins and
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.180]   offenses might abound.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.180]   What does this mean?
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.860]   Well, it means increase.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.860]   It means, if you like, be augmented.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.580]   Very well, there are our actual words.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.400]   What is then the teaching?
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.020]   What is the function of the law, according to the apostle?
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:19.900]   It's been brought in alongside in order that the offense, the sins, might abound.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.740]   Now then, I think we're in a position, are we not, to say the real business and object
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.340]   of the law.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.260]   Here we stop.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.780]   The law, obviously then, was never intended as a way of salvation.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.700]   I'm not going to stop with that tonight, because the apostle surely has made that abundantly
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.600]   plain and clear in the first four chapters.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:51.860]   By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law is
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.220]   the knowledge of sin.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.860]   He's already told us all that in verse 20 of the third chapter.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.740]   He's really just summing it up here.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.500]   This is the end of this great section, so he's summing it up once more.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.380]   There it is, and then you have that explicit statement in the third chapter of Galatians,
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.380]   verse 21.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.060]   "Is the law then against the promises of God?
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:25.060]   God forbid, for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.780]   should have been by the law."
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.140]   But he says that's impossible.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.780]   No law is capable of giving life.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:41.140]   So let us get rid once and forever, in a final sense, of the idea that God gave the law to
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.020]   the children of Israel in order to give them a chance to save themselves by it.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.600]   It was never intended for that.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.060]   It was not added as a possible means of salvation.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.620]   You sometimes hear people saying that in preaching.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.280]   Evangelists sometimes say it.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.380]   God gave them a chance to save themselves by the law.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.540]   He did not.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:05.620]   The law was added that the offense, the law entered that the offense might abound.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:14.740]   It was never intended as a way of salvation, because no law can ever save anybody.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:21.180]   It's impossible, says the apostle here and in Galatians 3, verse 21, and indeed everywhere.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.180]   All right.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:28.340]   "Very well then," says someone, "does he mean that the law was deliberately brought in alongside
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:35.660]   by God in order to make us sin more, that the offense might abound?"
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.980]   Well we needn't stay with this.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.940]   That's utterly impossible.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.260]   God neither tempteth any men nor can be tempted, says James.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.620]   God will never do anything to incite anybody to sin.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.500]   The suggestion is utterly impossible.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   Dismissed.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.940]   "Very well then, what is he saying?"
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:06.340]   Well what he's saying is this, that the law has actually, and was meant to, increase sin
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.180]   in three main ways.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.180]   What are they?
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:18.020]   Well first, the law increases our knowledge of sin.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.580]   Go back again to chapter 3, verse 20.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.660]   By the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.780]   You'll find him saying it again in the seventh verse of the seventh chapter.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.780]   What shall we say then?
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.100]   Is the law sin?
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.100]   God forbid.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:42.980]   "Nay, I have not known sin but by the law.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.820]   For I have not known lust except the law hath said thou shalt not covet."
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.060]   Here then is the first thing.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:59.220]   The business of the law is to increase my knowledge of sin.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.940]   And it does that in four main ways, I suggest.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.660]   Here is one.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:14.580]   Law increases my knowledge of sin because it defines sin for me.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.420]   You see, we are ignorant about sin.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.660]   People commit sin without knowing that they're committing sin.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.660]   We need to be educated.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.780]   A man might have done a thing for years and saw no harm in it, or indeed he might have
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.580]   seen a certain amount of harm in it, or harm in it in a certain sense, but still he doesn't
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.420]   know exactly what he's been doing.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:41.620]   Now the business of the law is to codify, is to define.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.020]   Now that sort of thing has obviously happened in the laws of most lands.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.920]   To start with, in primitive societies they had no laws at all.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.900]   But then as they go on, they find it's necessary to put certain things down in writing in order
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.460]   that we shall know what is right and what is wrong, what we can do and what we can't
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.460]   do.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.500]   In order to codify these things, you have to define them, because two people may not
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   agree about this.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.980]   "Well, very well then, sir, you write your laws, or you determine your law by cases,
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.620]   it doesn't matter how you do it.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.820]   The point is that you've got a number of principles and of rules and regulations to
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.820]   guide you."
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.260]   Now that's one of the functions of law.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.220]   It is to define sin, to pinpoint it.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.340]   Now the apostle has already said this twice, so I'm not going to stay with it.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:38.180]   The first time he says it is in chapter 4, verse 15, where he says, "Because the law
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:47.700]   worketh wrath, for where no law is, there is no transgression."
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.060]   There is sin, but there is no transgression.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.700]   That is the difference between sin and transgression.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.780]   Transgression is sin defined as such by the law.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.100]   It's no longer just a wrong act now, it is now breaking a law as well, because the law
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.100]   has defined it, it's transgression.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.420]   There it was then in chapter 4, verse 15.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:15.340]   But we've also, you remember, found it in this section that we're looking at in verse
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.340]   14.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:23.740]   "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not known it."
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:32.500]   Notice verse 13, "For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.300]   there is no law."
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.020]   And I think you'll remember that I interpreted that as meaning this, and it isn't my interpretation.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.260]   The word imputed here means this.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:48.300]   Sin, he says, though it was in the world before the law was given, it wasn't entered into
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.300]   the ledgers until the law came.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.620]   That's exactly what the word means.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.900]   It wasn't put down in the ledger.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.580]   It wasn't put down in the account.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.340]   It was sin, people did sin.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.340]   Yes, but it wasn't codified.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.020]   It wasn't put into the accounts.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.020]   That's the difference.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   That's what law does.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.660]   All right, it pinpoints it and defines it.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:15.060]   But then, going beyond that, of course, it helps us to an understanding and a knowledge
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:21.460]   of the real nature of sin in its depth.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.660]   Now we all know something about sin.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.220]   We've all got within us a sense of right and wrong, and we all, by nature, as Paul
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.380]   argued in chapter 2, even the pagans who've never had the law, they've got a conscience
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.960]   within them, and they can excuse or accuse one another.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.700]   We all know when we've done something that's wrong.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.620]   But oh, the fact that we know that doesn't mean that we know much about the nature of
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.140]   sin.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:51.500]   It's only the law that really gives us an understanding of the nature of sin.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.580]   Listen to Paul saying it in chapter 7, verse 13.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.660]   Was then that which is good made death unto me?
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.240]   God forbid.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:09.900]   But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good, that sin
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.580]   by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.420]   That's one of the things the law does.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:24.340]   It teaches me about the depth of sin, the fullness of sin, the nature of sin, the exceeding
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.260]   sinfulness of sin.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.980]   I would know this without the law.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:34.260]   A man doesn't really understand the nature of desire and of lust and of coveting and
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:39.480]   what he calls concupiscence, apart from the law.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.660]   But the law, you see, begins to teach us.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.540]   Listen to his other terms, listen to him talking about the motions of sin that were within
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.540]   me.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.700]   It's the law that stimulated all that, he said, and made me aware of all that.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.700]   I didn't know about it before, but now I do.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:02.380]   The law has given him a knowledge of the character of sin, and thereby it has increased sin,
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.140]   augmented sin.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.220]   It's made it greater.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:13.340]   But he also teaches us in that seventh chapter about the terrible power of sin.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.460]   You see, until the law comes and teaches us about these things, we don't really see the
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.980]   thing outside ourselves.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.700]   As I say, we are just aware that we do things that are wrong, and, "Oh, well, that's all
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.700]   right."
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.700]   We say, "That wasn't very much."
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:31.420]   But, oh, when the law has taught us and enlightened us, we are amazed at this horrible thing,
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.700]   this terrible power that has entered into the world.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.660]   But it's the law that opens our eyes to this.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.580]   People who are not taught in the law, they know nothing about this.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.940]   That's a part of their ignorance and their darkness.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.660]   And then that, in turn, leads me to the third point, which is this.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.260]   It is only the law that teaches me as to the terrible grip which sin has taken on the human
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.940]   heart.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.860]   It's only the law that teaches me that sin isn't just a matter of doing things that are
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.980]   wrong, that it's twisted my whole nature, that I'm a pervert, that every man born as
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.660]   the result of Adam's transgression is a moral pervert.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.020]   His whole nature is twisted.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:22.300]   And there again in the seventh chapter, he'll tell you all about that, what sin has done
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.860]   to the human heart.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:30.020]   And finally, the fourth point is, he brings out its awful deceitfulness.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:40.140]   "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.260]   No man knows that until he gets the teaching of the law.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.500]   He doesn't understand about the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   It's only the law that teaches him that sin has so affected him that the law that was
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.660]   meant in a sense to help him makes him sin all the more.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.660]   That's what sin has done.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.180]   Now then, by the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:06.580]   And you see the importance of preaching the law.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:11.180]   I suppose the greatest trouble in the church today as well as in the world is that men
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.740]   have not a knowledge of sin as they should have.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.460]   Sin is regarded very lightly and very loosely.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.380]   We are regarded as morbid if we preach the seventh of Romans and if we hold before people
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   their own sinfulness.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.100]   Oh, we are prepared to admit we want a bit of help and that we are weak in this respect
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:35.060]   or that, but the scripture teaches us the depth and the foulness, the exceeding sinfulness
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.620]   of sin.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.820]   And you see our fathers, our great-grandfathers, and those who went before them, they knew
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.860]   all about this.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.060]   And it was in such times you get revival, you see.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:53.620]   It's when men and women realize the depth of iniquity and of sin that is in them that
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.460]   they begin to cry out unto God.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:02.100]   But if you haven't a real understanding of sin, if we are lacking in a knowledge of sin
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:08.540]   which is given only by the law, well then we shall be content with a superficial evangelism.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.460]   And isn't that one of our troubles today?
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.540]   Hence the importance of going carefully and in detail into this postscript to this fifth
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.540]   chapter.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.660]   Very well, then, there's the first thing.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.940]   The law increases our knowledge of sin.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:32.620]   Secondly, because of that it increases our conviction of sin.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.060]   This isn't merely a matter of head knowledge or of intellectual information.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.780]   Oh no, if we really have the knowledge it will convict us.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.780]   How does it do so?
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.460]   Again, I want to suggest to you that it does it in two main ways.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:53.380]   First of all, it makes our sin greater, because now with this knowledge that the law has given
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:59.540]   us we not only do wrong but we know what we are doing.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.780]   You see, we didn't know it before.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.780]   We were like children.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:07.380]   A little child does something wrong, he really doesn't understand what he's doing.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.300]   It's only as he learns and gets greater knowledge that he'll have an understanding of the wrongfulness
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.780]   of the thing that he's doing.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.660]   So that is the man's position as the result of the knowledge which is given him by the
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.940]   law.
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.180]   It therefore convicts him more deeply of his sin.
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:31.220]   You see, now with this knowledge that the law gives me I realize that when I do wrong
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:38.980]   I'm not just committing a wrong action, I'm defying the majesty of God.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:45.660]   I'm standing up to God's holiness and righteousness and his everlasting law.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.700]   That's the terrible thing about sin.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.140]   It isn't merely that I'm sorry afterwards or that I've hurt myself or hurt somebody
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.140]   else.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.140]   No, no.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:59.140]   Oh, David, you see, saw something of it in the 51st Psalm, "Against thee, thee only,
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   have I sinned."
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.820]   It says a man who was an adulterer and a murderer, but he'd seen it.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.100]   The terrible thing about what he'd done was not merely that he'd committed adultery with
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.020]   Bathsheba and that he'd murdered her husband.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:17.180]   "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight."
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.460]   He knew better.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.540]   That's the thing that breaks him down and that he can't forgive himself for.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.780]   And it's the same with all of us once we know something about the law.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.500]   It isn't merely that we do wrong things.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.620]   We are flouting the vice divine.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.380]   We are spurning the vice divine.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:40.340]   We are deliberately putting our wills against the will of God.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.340]   Adam did that.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.820]   We in turn, once we know the law, are doing the same thing.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.620]   The people between Adam and Moses, as he's told us already in verses 13 and 14, they
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.160]   didn't realize it fully.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.420]   They sinned, but they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.140]   They didn't sin after the similitude of Adam's transgression.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:03.220]   But once the law comes, it gives us this knowledge, and so it makes our sin much worse.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.620]   Sin abounds.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.820]   It becomes a much bigger and a more heinous thing.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.780]   And why am I so concerned about this?
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.060]   And why am I stressing it and emphasizing it?
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:21.620]   Well for this reason, that that is the way to convict your good moral men of being a
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.620]   sinner.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:30.620]   You see, there are so many people in the modern world, educated people, good people.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.140]   Of course they're not drunkards.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.380]   Of course they're not adulterers.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.380]   Murder?
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380]   Impossible.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.220]   They're the most respectable people in the land.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.380]   And they feel, you see, that they can sit and listen to your preaching, and they're
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.380]   quite unaffected.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.580]   They've never done any of these things, and they do a tremendous lot of good.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   They're idealists.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   They're philanthropists.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.060]   They're doing good with both hands.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:32:02.620]   There's only one way to convict them of sin, and it's this way.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.380]   Where does God come into their lives?
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.740]   Do they ever think about him?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.420]   Do they live their good life because of him?
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.060]   God is entirely ignored by them and insulted by them.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:28.260]   I would say that the greatest sinners in the world tonight are the self-satisfied, self-contained,
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:37.100]   good moral people, because they believe that they, as they are, are fit to stand in the
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.860]   presence of God.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:43.620]   And secondly, they are telling God that he need never have sent his Son into the world,
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.100]   and the Son need never have died upon the cross.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:52.380]   There is no greater insult to God than that, and that's what they are guilty of.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.340]   There is no greater sinner in the universe than the man who has never seen his need of
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.100]   the blood of Christ.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.100]   There is no sin greater than that.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:07.820]   Adultery and murder and fornication are nothing by its side.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.300]   That's the gospel.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:15.380]   So you see, it is most important that we should realize this.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.740]   It determines our preaching.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.100]   It determines our evangelism.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.820]   If we are going to preach and evangelize in this sort of way and say, "Are any of you
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.820]   in trouble?
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.820]   Are you unhappy?"
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.460]   The good moral man says, "Of course, this has nothing to do with me.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.900]   I'm perfectly happy and I'm not in trouble at all."
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.100]   We say, "Then some of you are victims of drink and of sex and so on."
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.220]   "He's not preaching to me," says the good moral man.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.460]   "These things don't worry me at all.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.460]   I'm a happily married man.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.980]   I've got my children and all is well.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   Is there some crisis?"
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.180]   "No crisis in my life."
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.020]   He sits as the Pharisee sat listening to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.100]   We are told that they were sitting by, looking on as spectators.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.140]   "Oh, this is all right for some people.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.140]   Nothing to say to me."
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.860]   So you see, we mustn't preach like that.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:07.100]   We don't start with men's needs, with their weaknesses, their fears, their phobias, and
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.140]   all the rest of it.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.740]   We don't preach subjectively.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   What do we preach?
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.100]   We preach God.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:20.020]   We preach the Lord of the universe, the Creator, the Lord God Almighty, the everlasting God.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.340]   And we tell all men that they're under him and before him.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:29.500]   Your good moral man comes in there, and everybody comes in there.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.260]   I'm not surprised, you know, that so many people are outside the church.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:40.180]   We've been preaching the gospel in a way that it seems to them that it's irrelevant.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.940]   We are to hold mankind face to face with God.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.060]   And the moment we do that, it's not difficult to prove that there is none righteous, no,
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.620]   but one, that the whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.060]   That self-contained man with his self-contained house and his self-contained everything, he
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.500]   never thinks of God.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.620]   He doesn't worship him.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.620]   He never comes on Sunday with others to join in singing his praise.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.620]   He's the greatest sinner of them all.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.940]   He can live without God.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.940]   He's not interested in God.
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.060]   And the Son of God was never necessary.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:23.300]   Oh, my friends, the law, it's the law that teaches us like this and convicts us of sin,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.100]   because the law always brings us face to face with God.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.700]   Oh, let me give you the final proof of what I'm saying.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.220]   You remember the man who came one day with his clever question to our Lord?
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.660]   He said, "Now then, which is the first and the greatest commandment in the law?"
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.660]   You see, he knew.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.980]   He came from the circles in which they were always arguing about these things.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.940]   One said that adultery was the greatest.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.780]   Others said, "No, I think it's murder."
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.340]   And the other said this, that, or the other.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.900]   It was always something that you did.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.700]   And our Lord's answer was devastating.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.860]   They never expected it.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   This, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength."
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.740]   That's the first commandment.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.740]   Attitude towards God.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.020]   "And then your attitude to your neighbour."
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.020]   That's the second.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.700]   It's like it.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.500]   Not actions primarily.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.980]   The first is your relationship to God and your attitude towards him.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.860]   Well, very well, it's the law alone that will teach us that.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:37.380]   It convicts us, and it also convicts us of the extent of our own sinfulness.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:43.940]   Paul says in chapter 7, "I was alive without the law once, but then the commandment came,
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.260]   'Sin revived and I died.'"
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:52.740]   What makes him write about himself as he does in chapter 7 and call himself a wretched man
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.420]   and feel his utter helplessness and that he can do nothing about himself?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.180]   Oh, it's what the law has taught him.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:06.780]   The law has convicted him of the depth of his sinfulness, his inability, his total inability
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:11.340]   to do anything at all about it, and has made him see that in him that is to say in his
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:18.380]   flesh dwelleth no good thing, and that he is a wretched man without hope altogether.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:25.260]   The law convicts us of the extent of our own sinfulness.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.540]   That's the second thing, which I've thus divided into two headings.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.460]   Now that brings me to my third main heading.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:39.420]   The third thing that the law therefore was meant to do, or actually does, is this.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:46.460]   The law not only increases my knowledge of sin, and not only increases my conviction
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:38:01.700]   of sin, the law, because of what sin has done to me, actually makes me sin and incites me
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.700]   to sin.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:09.340]   Listen to the evidence in chapter 7, verses 5, 8, and 11.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:19.260]   "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.780]   members to bring forth fruit unto death."
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.860]   There's the first statement of it.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:33.740]   Look at verse 8, "But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:39.420]   of concupiscence, for without the law sin was dead."
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.500]   And then the ninth follows, "For I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.140]   came, sin revived and I died."
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:55.580]   Then in verse 11, "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:59.100]   slew me."
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.900]   Because of what sin has done to me, and because it's perverted my nature, and because it's
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:10.180]   got such a grip on my heart, the very law that tells me not to do things creates within
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.380]   me a desire to do them all the more.
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:19.980]   "Unto the pure," says Paul to Titus, "all things are pure.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:25.660]   But unto them that are sinful and defiled is nothing pure, but even their minds and
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.740]   consciences are defiled."
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:34.580]   And that is why I would tell you again that I've never believed in morality teaching.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.060]   Because if you teach people morality, I mean now about sex and things like that, the thing
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.980]   they're introducing to the schools now, and so on and so forth.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.580]   I don't believe in it for this reason.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.420]   Because the minds of these children are impure as a result of sin, and what you're going
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:55.540]   to do to them is to create a greater desire to know about these things and to do them.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.400]   They're already finding out about it surreptitiously.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.980]   You are now going to do it officially for them through your education committees, and
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.140]   they'll revel in it and they'll gloat in it, and they'll enjoy it tremendously, and you'll
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.260]   add to your sin.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.380]   Knowledge of sin has never prevented anybody from sinning.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:21.660]   Indeed, the more one knows about it, the more one is subject to the temptation to do it.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.580]   No, no.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:37.420]   Once and forever, says Paul, the law has increased sin, even in that sense that it's made us
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.220]   sin even more.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.580]   It was never meant to do it.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.060]   The law is just and holy and good.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.060]   The trouble is in me.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.780]   "Don't say there's anything wrong with the law," he says.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.060]   "Was then that which is good made death unto me?
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.060]   God forbid!
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:59.860]   But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me, by the commandment might become
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.620]   exceedingly sinful."
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.420]   What a terrible thing sin is.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:13.460]   And it's only the law that shells us this, because it even makes us sin.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.380]   Very well then, I give you my fourth and my last point, which is this.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.860]   It isn't actually here, but he puts it so plainly in the parallel statement in Galatians
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.340]   3 that I must introduce it here.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.940]   We are dealing with the object of the law.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.700]   Why did the law enter in alongside?
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.860]   Why did God put it there?
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.940]   Well, here's the final thing.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:42.260]   Its ultimate object—and this leads to the second half of our verse tonight—the ultimate
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:49.100]   object of the giving of the law was to bring us to Christ.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:53.820]   Listen to Galatians 3, verses 22 to 24.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:42:02.780]   "But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.700]   might be given to them that believe.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.780]   But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith that should
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.180]   afterwards be revealed."
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.420]   That's its job.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.300]   "Wherefore, the law was our schoolmaster, our pedagogue, the one who takes us by the
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.740]   hand and takes us to the school where we can finally learn."
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.740]   That's what it is.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:31.860]   The law is our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.860]   That is what the law was meant to do.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:41.140]   Far from being designed to save us, it was meant to show us that nothing and nobody could
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:50.660]   save us but the Son of God, our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:43:07.700]   Here it is then, moreover, the law entered that in order that the offense might abound,
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:15.460]   in order that we might so see ourselves as we are in sin, that we should know and feel
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:23.300]   our utter and complete hopelessness.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   I had no intention of spending so long on this first half of this verse.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:37.060]   I have done so for the reason that I've already been giving, that somehow or another we have
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:44.220]   forgotten this law work in connection with our preaching.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:49.620]   Great preachers of three hundred years ago and two hundred years ago spent a long time
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.780]   with what they called a law work.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.300]   We don't hear about it today.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.460]   My feeling is that the Church is as she is for that reason.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:06.060]   Our work is all superficial because you've got to go down before you go up.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.700]   You see, you can't appreciate the second half of this verse if you don't appreciate
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.460]   the first half.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:17.380]   The law entered that the offense might abound, but where sin abounded, there did grace much
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.380]   more abound.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.900]   But, you see, if you don't see the first half, you can't possibly see the second.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.060]   We can't go into this this evening.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.660]   But there it is, you see.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:40.100]   The man who really knows something about the grace of God is the man who knows most about
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.780]   his own sinfulness.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.300]   The man who thinks there was very little wrong is very easily put right.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.540]   There's not much in it.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:57.180]   But you see, Samuel Davis, whose hymn we sang as our second hymn, and read about Samuel
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   Davis.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.500]   He lived two hundred years ago in the United States of America.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:07.100]   He was one of the successors of Jonathan Edwards as principal of Princeton University.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:16.060]   He was not only a towering genius, worthy of comparison in many senses with Jonathan
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.340]   Edwards himself, but he was a mighty preacher.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:26.180]   And he was used of God as Edwards was in a great revival.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:33.300]   He is the man who writes, "Great God of wonders, all thy ways are God, matchless,
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.660]   God-like and divine."
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.740]   He works in creation, in nature, in every way.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:48.540]   "For the fair glories of thy grace, more God-like and unrivaled shine."
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.700]   This is the amazing thing.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.460]   Who is a pardoning God like thee?
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.840]   And who has grace so rich and free?
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.700]   You see, it's down in the depths.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.700]   You realize that.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.780]   You say, "I've gone so low, nothing can ever do it."
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.420]   "It's all right," says Paul, "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.020]   But I mustn't go on.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:13.740]   I want to spend adequate time on that.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:20.500]   But I just show you that you can't appreciate the second half of the verse if you don't
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.780]   understand the first half of the verse.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:29.340]   Well, God willing, we'll go on with that next Friday, but let's meditate upon the
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.460]   knowledge that the law has given us, my friends.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:40.300]   Let's see ourselves as we really are in the light of the law.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.980]   Let's not be like the children of Israel who are always saying, "Peace, peace," when there
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.340]   was no peace.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.700]   Let's not be like the false prophets against whom the charge is, "They have healed the
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:56.200]   heart of the daughter of my people," lightly saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.660]   It's not enough just to say to a sinner, "Come to Jesus."
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.980]   No, no, let him know what he's doing.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.940]   Let him see himself.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.380]   If you want him to admire the matchless grace of Christ, well, let him realize what he is
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.380]   first.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.620]   He can't fully realize it.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:18.740]   Apart from that, you must see that sin has abounded, and the law makes it abound in the
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.500]   ways that we've seen.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:29.940]   And then you can go on to look at the other side and begin to enjoy it here in this world,
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:37.220]   and go on enjoying it more and more, and go on enjoying it throughout the countless ages
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.220]   of eternity.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.220]   Let us pray.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:53.500]   O Lord, our God, we know not what to say, as again we come unto thee.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:03.820]   We can but bow before thee, and worship thee, and praise thy great and holy name, great
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:16.380]   God of wonders, all thy ways, God-like, matchless, and divine.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:29.900]   But O Lord, we worship thee above all, that we see thee in the face of Jesus Christ, and
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:35.580]   all the matchless grace that is in him.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:45.300]   O God, receive the tribute, the praise, the adoration of the whole of our being.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:58.020]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within, bless his holy name.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:04.860]   But now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:12.780]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us, now this night, throughout
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:21.820]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:32.060]   shall see him face to face, in all his glory, in the glory.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.620]   Amen.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.540]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
