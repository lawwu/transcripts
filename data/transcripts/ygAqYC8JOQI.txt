[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.460]   what kind of things would you talk about here?
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.360]   What kind of questions would you ask?
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.240]   The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.700]   He's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.320]   with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.840]   His films tell stories of war and power,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.000]   fearlessly and often controversially shining light
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.360]   on the dark parts of American and global history.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.040]   His films include "Platoon", "Wall Street",
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.680]   "Born on the Fourth of July", "Scarface",
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.120]   "JFK", "Nixon", "Alexander", "W", "Snowden"
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.720]   and documentaries where he has interviewed
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.400]   some of the most powerful and consequential people
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000]   in the world, including Fidel Castro,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.680]   Hugo Chavez and Vladimir Putin.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520]   And in this conversation, Oliver and I mostly focus
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.320]   our discussion on Vladimir Putin, Russia
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680]   and the war in Ukraine.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   My goal with these conversations is to understand
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.040]   the human being before me, to understand not just
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.620]   what they think, but how they think,
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.240]   to steel man their ideas and to steel man
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.820]   the devil's advocate, all in service of understanding,
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.560]   not derision.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.680]   I have done this poorly in the past.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.520]   I'm still struggling with this,
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.540]   but I'm working hard to do better.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   I believe the moment we draw lines between good people
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.040]   and evil people, we'll lose our ability to see
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.080]   that we're all one people in the most fundamental of ways
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.960]   and lose track of the deep truth expressed
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.900]   by the old Solzhenitsyn line that I've returned
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.400]   to time and time again, that the line between good
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.220]   and evil runs through the heart of every man.
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.440]   Oliver Stone has a perspective that he extensively documents
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.640]   in his powerful controversial series,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   The Untold History of the United States,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.720]   that imperialism and the military industrial complex
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.460]   paved the path to absolute power and thus corrupt the minds
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.780]   of the leaders and institutions that wield it.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.720]   From this perspective, the way out of the humanitarian crisis
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.800]   and human suffering in Ukraine and the way out
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.440]   from the pull of the beating drums of nuclear war
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.840]   is not simple to understand, but we must,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.580]   because all of humanity hangs in the balance.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.320]   I will talk to many people who seek to understand the way out
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.680]   of this growing catastrophe, including to historians,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.380]   to leaders, and perhaps most importantly,
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.600]   to people on the ground in Ukraine and Russia,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.080]   not just about war and suffering, but about life,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.300]   friendship, family, love, and hope.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.720]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.920]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.840]   in the description, and now, dear friends,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.520]   here's Oliver Stone.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.660]   You're working on a documentary now about nuclear energy.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.500]   - Yes.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.720]   - So it's interesting to talk about this.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.520]   Energy is such a big part of the world,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.400]   about the geopolitics of the world,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.280]   about the way the world is.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.400]   What do you think is the role of nuclear energy
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.360]   in the 21st century?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.080]   - Good question, and first of all,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.920]   everyone's talking about climate change, right?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.720]   So here I wake up to that a few years ago,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.360]   and clearly we're concerned.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.360]   I picked up a book by Josh Goldstein
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.760]   and his co-author, who's Swedish.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.280]   Those two wrote a book called "A Bright Future."
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.680]   It came out a few years ago, and I lapped it up.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.980]   It was a book, fact-based, clear,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.640]   not too long, and not too technical,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.040]   and it was very clear that they were in favor
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   of all kinds of renewables, renewable energy, yes.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   They hated, made it very clear how dangerous
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.960]   oil and gas were, methane,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.840]   and made it very clear to the layman like me,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.900]   and at the same time said that these renewables
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.440]   could work so far, but the gap is enormous
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.120]   as to how much electricity the world is gonna need
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960]   in 2050 and beyond.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.760]   Two, three, four times, we don't even know the damage,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.920]   but we have India, we have China, we have Africa,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.560]   we have Asia coming onto the scene
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.920]   wanting more and more electricity.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.200]   So they addressed the problem as a global one,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.560]   not just as often in the United States,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.000]   you get the ethnocentric United States point of view
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.200]   that we know we're doing well, blah, blah, blah.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.080]   We're not doing well, but we sell that
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.440]   to people that we're comfortable.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.080]   We spend more energy than anybody in this country
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.280]   per capita than anybody, and at the same time,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.720]   we don't seem to understand the global picture.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   So that's what they did, and they made me very aware.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.680]   So the only way to close that gap,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.800]   the only way in their mind is nuclear energy,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.840]   and talking about a gap of building a huge amount
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   of reactors over the next 30 years, and starting now.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.720]   They make that point over and over again.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.880]   So obviously this country, the United States,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.280]   is not gonna go in that direction,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.680]   because it just is incapable of having that kind of will,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.560]   political will, and fear is a huge factor,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.280]   and still a lot of shibboleths, a lot of myths
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.560]   about nuclear energy have confused
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.000]   and confounded the landscape.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.760]   The environmentalists have played a huge role
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.120]   in doing good things, many good things,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.440]   but also confusing and confounding the landscape,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.560]   and making accusations against nuclear energy
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.820]   that were exaggerated.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.400]   So taking all these things into consideration,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.120]   we set about making this documentary,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.040]   which is about finished now, almost finishing.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.120]   It's an hour and 40 minutes, and that was a hard part,
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   getting it down from about three and a half hours
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.200]   to about this, something more manageable.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.760]   - Is it interviews?
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.440]   - It's interviews among others,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   but essentially we went to Russia,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.680]   we went to France, which is the most, perhaps,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.580]   advanced nuclear country in the world, Russia,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.160]   and the United States.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.720]   We went to the Idaho Laboratory,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.840]   and talked to the scientists there,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.640]   as well as the Department of Energy people
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.700]   that are handling this.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.280]   Idaho is one of the experimental labs,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.340]   the United States is probably one of the most advanced,
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.960]   and they're doing a lot of advanced nuclear there.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.960]   We also, we studied, well, Russia gave us a lot of insight,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.520]   were very cooperative, because they have
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.080]   some of the most advanced nuclear,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.160]   actually the probably most advanced nuclear reactor
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.440]   in the world, at Beloyarsk, at the Ural Mountains.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.720]   So we did an investigation there,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   and in France they have some very advanced nuclear reactors
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.360]   and they're building, now they're building again.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.600]   They had a little, the Green Party came into power,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.560]   not into power, but became a factor in France,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.160]   and there was a motion when Hollande was president,
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.880]   they started to move away from it.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.080]   Actually, they were beginning to just abandon,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.040]   they let, not complete, in other words,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.600]   close down some of the nuclear reactors.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.320]   There was talk of that, but thank God, France did not do that
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.160]   and Macron came in and recently reversed it.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.840]   They reversed it and they're building as fast as they can now
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.160]   especially with the Ukraine war going on.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.640]   There's an awareness that Russia will not be providing,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.120]   may not be providing the energy Europe needs.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.400]   And then China is the other one too.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.320]   That's the other factor.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.600]   I'm talking about the big boys.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.720]   They are doing tremendous work and fast,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.360]   which is very hopeful, but of course China
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.920]   is building in all directions at once.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.080]   Coal continues to be huge in China,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.080]   and methane too, but China is building
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.200]   to basically coal, coal in India, in China,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   are the biggest users of coal.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.080]   And as you know, Germany went back to coal a few years ago.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.960]   So all these factors, it's a fascinating picture globally.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.480]   So we try to achieve a consensus
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.720]   that where nuclear can work and where it will be working,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.920]   whereas it will be used more and more.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.320]   The question is how much carbon dioxide
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.840]   China and Russia will be putting out.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.240]   France is the only one that's not putting it out.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.640]   The United States has not changed.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.600]   With all the talk and all the nonsense about renewables
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.360]   and the new lifestyle and all this,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.300]   it's great for your guilt complex,
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.200]   but it doesn't do anything for the total accumulation
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.640]   of carbon dioxide in the world.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.080]   - Who's gonna lead the way on nuclear, do you think?
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   You mentioned Russia, France, China, United States.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.920]   Who's gonna lead?
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.080]   - Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.200]   a United Nations kind of thing,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.480]   because the world doesn't seem capable of uniting.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.880]   We go to these conferences, Kyoto,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.800]   and we talk and we agree,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.440]   but then we don't actually enforce.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.720]   I don't think it can happen that way.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.120]   I think it's gonna be an individual race with countries.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.200]   They're gonna just do it for their own self-interest,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.160]   like China's doing it.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.800]   China, the thing is, if it works,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.680]   and I'm praying that it will really work on a big scale,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.240]   China will back away from coal naturally.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.960]   The same thing will be true of India.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.140]   They will see the benefits,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.200]   because if you go to India,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.000]   you see the cities, the pollution.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.400]   You walk around in that stuff,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   and you get, there's no hope in this,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   and you sense it.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.720]   So people will move in this direction naturally,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.800]   because nuclear is clean energy.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.580]   And the amount of casualties of nuclear
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.760]   is the lowest on the industrial scale
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   for energy producing, from coal down to oil, everything.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.640]   The lowest casualty rate, very lowest,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.860]   .002 or something is nuclear.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.060]   So not that many people have died from nuclear.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.900]   Not that many.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.580]   I think 50 people at Chernobyl,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.580]   which was the worst accident.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.100]   Nobody died at Fukushima.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.780]   Nobody died at Three Mile Island,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.380]   and that's what you hear all over and over again,
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.900]   these accidents.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.420]   The environmentalists have sold us the idea
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.660]   that they're dangerous.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.940]   And it's, a lot of environmentalists,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.320]   thank God, have changed.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.640]   They've come off that routine,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.360]   and they've saying, we were wrong.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.960]   We've done a lot of good work.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.440]   Greenpeace did a lot of good work.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.520]   Whale, saving this, saving that.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.440]   But they admit themselves, not they don't,
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.320]   but people who have been in the organization
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.640]   have said, we were wrong.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   In 1956, we show the articles in the New York Times
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.100]   that came out.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.280]   The Rockefeller Foundation,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.300]   which of course is a big producer of oil,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.660]   the Rockefeller family.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.660]   And the foundation came out with a study,
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.900]   which was weighted.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.300]   They tipped the scale, put a thumb on the scale.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.020]   But it was a scientific expose of radiation
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.180]   in the study that came out, printed in the New York Times,
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.660]   because the New York Times publisher, Sulzberger,
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.060]   was on their board.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.040]   He was one of the board members.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.920]   So they got a lot of strong publicity
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.360]   condemning radiation, which started the process
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.000]   of doubting nuclear energy.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.440]   The radiation levels that they pointed out were very minor.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.600]   And of course, if you go into a scientific analysis
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.080]   of this now with what we know, it's just not true.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.200]   But it tilted the scale back in the '50s, '60s,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.440]   and started the questioning the nuclear business.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.920]   - Do you think that was malevolence or incompetence?
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.120]   - No, I think it was competition.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.600]   I don't think it was conspiracy as much as it was a sense
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.160]   that we don't want this nuclear energy.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.800]   It's gonna end the dominance of oil.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.600]   Absolutely, and it will.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.080]   And it will anyway, because it's the only sane way
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.480]   for the world to proceed.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.400]   But the world will have to learn through adversity.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.520]   So in other words, the situation could get worse,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.440]   much worse, and certain countries are just gonna have
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.240]   to adapt like we always do.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.960]   When things become too hard, you've got to go,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.400]   you have to change your thinking.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.200]   - And humans are pretty good at that.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.820]   - Yes, talking about human nature,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.000]   they're very adept at that.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.200]   Germany, for example, I mean, they were,
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.520]   when the Fukushima happened,
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.120]   they went out of the nuclear business.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.440]   That was shocking to me.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.320]   They just pulled out and they destroyed,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.480]   destructed several of their nuclear reactors
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.960]   who were still functioning and put up coal,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.400]   or yeah, put up coal and oil, replaced it.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.580]   And as a result, Germany drifted into this place
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.760]   next to France.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.500]   Their electricity bills went up and France stayed the same.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.240]   They don't have that, they have a different system
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.760]   in Europe, but more or less, no question that France
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.840]   was doing a lot better than Germany.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.880]   And now, with this Ukraine issue,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.840]   it's a very interesting fulcrum point,
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.680]   whether Germany is, what direction they're gonna go now.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.240]   How can they, how can they keep going with coal?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.120]   They just can't.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.060]   - What's the connection between oil, coal,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.640]   nuclear, and war?
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.200]   Sort of energy and conflict.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.280]   When you look at the 21st century,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.160]   when you were doing this documentary,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.200]   were you thinking of nuclear as a way to power the world,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.480]   but is it also to avoid conflict over resources?
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   Is there some aspect to energy being a source of conflict
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.620]   that we're trying to avoid?
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:06.960]   - I don't have the energy, the history of energy
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   at my fingertips, and it's a very long history here.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.480]   But I would say, apparently not.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.480]   It does seem that it's individually,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.320]   each country can answer its needs by building.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.580]   And up until now, we haven't had conflict,
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.260]   except in this issue of Russia supplying Europe.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:34.880]   Obviously, the pipeline, Nord Stream 2 has been closed,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.840]   and Nord Stream 1 is also probably gonna be phased out.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   And the concept of Russia supplying gas to Europe
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.480]   is now up in the air, and who knows what's gonna happen.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.840]   I just don't see how Europe can get away
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.880]   from using Russian gas.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.460]   But Russian gas is not the solution,
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.840]   because it's methane, too,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.780]   and it goes up into the atmosphere.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.780]   Methane, in the short term, is worse than coal, worse.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.760]   There's all kinds of charts we show in the film.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.320]   We try not to be too over-factual,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.940]   but methane is not the answer.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.280]   It's a short-term answer.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:22.040]   Will countries go to war over energy is a question
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.800]   that I'm trying to think of all the wars that happened.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.080]   You could say Germany, of course, during World War II,
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.440]   needed oil very badly, and it dictated their strategy
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.160]   with Romania, et cetera,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.760]   and getting the oil fields open.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.680]   But I don't really, I haven't thought that one through.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.220]   I'd have to make a documentary on it
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.800]   to really understand how energy and war interface.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.160]   - It's always part of the calculation,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.560]   but it's a question of how much.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.440]   Right, that's the question.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   I just have to ask,
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.680]   'cause you mentioned your mom was from France.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.440]   You've traveled for this documentary,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.520]   and you traveled in general throughout the world,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.140]   in Russia, Ukraine.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.820]   What are the defining characteristics of these cultures?
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.480]   Let's go with Russia.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.680]   So I, as I told you, I came from,
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.520]   I'm half Ukrainian, half Russian.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.280]   I came from that part of the world.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.840]   What are some interesting, beautiful aspects
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.600]   of the culture of Russia and Ukraine?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   - I can't really speak honestly of Ukraine.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.360]   I was there only in 1983,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.560]   when I visited the Soviet Union under the communism.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.800]   And Kiev was beautiful,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.880]   and it was one of the nicer places I went.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.760]   But they were very much stultified by the communist system.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.240]   They all were.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.720]   The best places to visit in Russia were always in the south,
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   whether Georgia or the Muslim countries.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.480]   It was always a better culture in terms of comfort.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.080]   But communism was rough, and that was the end of it,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.720]   pretty much, Brezhnev regime.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.760]   Then Andropov, Gorbachev was three years in the future
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.800]   when I was there.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.160]   So I can't talk about Ukraine,
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.200]   and they've not been friendly to me since,
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   of course, since I made the Putin interviews,
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.680]   Ukraine has banned me, I believe.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.160]   They've been very tough on people who are critical.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.120]   I think the Russian people have been very special to me,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.420]   perhaps because of my European upbringing,
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.960]   but I enjoy talking to them.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   I find them very open, very generous.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   And they appreciate support.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.600]   They appreciate people who say,
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.800]   I understand why your government is doing this
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.360]   or this or this.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.080]   I've tried to stay open-minded and listen to both sides.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   The thing that I have seen as an American
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.000]   is, of course, this American enmity towards Russia
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.480]   from the very beginning.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.880]   I grew up in 1940, '46, I was born.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   In the '50s, it was so anti-Russian.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.700]   They were everywhere.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.080]   They were in our schools, they were in our State Department,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.240]   they were spying on us,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.000]   they were stealing the country from us.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.640]   That was the way the American right wing,
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.280]   not even the right wing, I'd say the Republican Party,
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   pictured the Russians.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.860]   They were actively engaged in infiltrating America
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.720]   and changing our thinking.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.840]   And television shows were based on this.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.080]   It was very much the J. Edgar Hoover mentality
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.960]   that communism was even behind the student protests
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.560]   of the 1960s.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.640]   This was the direction in which the FBI
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.720]   and the CIA were thinking.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.680]   So I grew up with a prejudice.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.240]   And it took me many years.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.800]   My father was a Republican and he was a stockbroker
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.120]   and he was a very intelligent man.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.720]   But even he, because he was a World War II soldier,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.480]   he was a colonel, had fallen under the influence.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.080]   In order to be successful in American business
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.400]   in the 1950s, you had to have a very strong
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.720]   anti-Soviet line, very strong.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.080]   You wouldn't get ahead.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.640]   If you expressed any kind of, let's end this Cold War,
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.440]   any kind of activity of that nature,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.040]   you'd be cast aside as a pinko or somebody who was
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.560]   not completely on the board with the American way
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.920]   of doing business, which was capitalism works,
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.080]   communism doesn't.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.680]   - And in particular, communism was embodied
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.400]   by the Soviet Union as the enemy.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.800]   So hence--
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.720]   - Yeah, that's the way you were--
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.860]   - The narrative behind the Cold War.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.080]   - That's correct.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.840]   And it basically lasted.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.480]   I mean, you saw the ups and downs of it.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.000]   When Reagan came in, I was, well, first of all,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.160]   we had the crisis of 1962 with the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.520]   And Kennedy proved himself to be a warrior for peace.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.360]   He resolved that with Khrushchev.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.320]   That was a big moment, huge moment.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.520]   And people don't give him credit enough
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.400]   for really saving us from a war
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.480]   that could have affected all of mankind.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.800]   - But it still didn't avert--
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.960]   - No, because the moment he was killed,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.440]   honestly, there was a lot of, we can talk about that.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.160]   And as you know, I've made a film,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.520]   JFK Revisited is a documentary we released this year
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.600]   about the movie I made in 1991.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.440]   But the moment he was killed,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.200]   I would argue that Lyndon Johnson went back immediately
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.600]   to the old way of thinking,
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.760]   the old way of doing business,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.360]   which was the Eisenhower-Truman way,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.280]   which we had adapted since World War II.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.800]   That was an interim.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.560]   You have to think about it from Roosevelt dies in '45.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.400]   Roosevelt has an interim of 16, 15 years
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   where he has more of a democratic regime, more liberal.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.640]   He establishes, he recognizes the Soviet Union
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.040]   for the first time since the revolution,
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.680]   and he actually has a relationship with them.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.960]   He sends ambassadors who are friendly,
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.480]   and he has a relationship with Stalin, et cetera,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.960]   and at Yalta, or no, at Tehran, rather,
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.040]   that's where he had the relationship.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.880]   - Do you think if JFK lived, we would not have a Cold War?
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.560]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.600]   And we go into great depth on that in the film,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.040]   and I'd urge you to see it,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   because it goes into all the issues around the world.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.960]   Kennedy was being very much an anti-imperialist,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.920]   it turns out, and many people don't understand that,
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.580]   but you have to look at all his policies in Middle East,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.840]   with Nasser, he had a relationship,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.780]   and with Sukarno in Indonesia.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.800]   With Latin America, he made a big effort
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.640]   with the Alliance for Progress,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.800]   and when Africa, above all, with Lumumba,
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.760]   he was very shocked at his death,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   and tried to defend the integrity of the Belgian Congo
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.360]   with Dag Hammarskjöld of the UN.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.800]   He made a big effort.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.200]   Unfortunately, it didn't work out,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.240]   because Dag Hammarskjöld was killed,
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.800]   and then Kennedy was killed,
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.380]   and Congo descended into the chaos
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.200]   of Joseph Mbutu's dictatorship.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.000]   But Kennedy was very active in terms of,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.880]   as an Irishman, not as an Englishman,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.680]   he was an Irishman.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.840]   And I say that because, well, we'll come back to that,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.560]   because Mr. Joe Biden is an Irishman,
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.000]   but it's a different kind of an Irishman.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.120]   They're both Catholic Irish,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.960]   but Kennedy really made an effort
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.300]   to change the imperialist mindset
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.960]   that still was very strong in America and Europe.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.120]   Lyndon Johnson changed back to the old policy,
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.360]   and we were never able to really keep
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.800]   detente going with the Russians.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.440]   Briefly had it with Carter,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.800]   but then Brzezinski came in.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.480]   Brzezinski was his national security advisor.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.960]   He was put there by Rockefeller,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.800]   and Brzezinski was a Pole.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.720]   He got revenge from Poland.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.080]   Poland has always been attacking Russia,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.760]   as far as I remember, back to another century.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.880]   I mean, the two world wars that occupied Russia,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   and so, tragically, entry points were always through Poland
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.720]   and Ukraine.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.680]   So Brzezinski got his revenge,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.560]   and Carter ended up being an enemy of the Soviet Union,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.200]   and creating, as Brzezinski took pride in it,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.360]   he created the atmosphere,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.600]   the trap for the Soviets to go into Afghanistan in '79.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.080]   That trap was set, he says, he said, in 1978.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.280]   So there was never, except for brief moments,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.320]   periods of detente with the Soviets.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.160]   And I grew up under that.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.760]   I didn't really know anything of this going on,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.720]   'cause I was learning, I was educating myself.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.160]   I was going, learning movies,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.000]   and trying to be a dramatist, and this and that.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.240]   So I wasn't thinking about this.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.440]   Then, when Reagan came in, I was worried again,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.480]   because it was the old beat,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.840]   which was there, the most evil empire.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.960]   I mean, it goes on in American history.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.800]   It doesn't end.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.080]   Reagan got a lot of points for that.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.560]   And of course, when Gorbachev came in,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.360]   it was a beautiful moment for the world.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.000]   It was a great surprise.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.480]   It was probably the best years for America,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.040]   at least from my point of view,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.280]   in terms of this relaxation in the mood.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.280]   1986 to 1991 were great years in terms of ability
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.040]   to believe, once again, that there could be a peace dividend.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.080]   But the world changed again in 1991, '92.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.880]   There's an internal mechanism, who knows.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.000]   You could blame the United States,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.680]   you could blame Russia for...
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.080]   Gorbachev was perhaps not the right man
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.400]   to try to administer that country at that point.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.240]   He had great visions.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.100]   He was a man of peace.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.840]   But it was very difficult to hold together
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.040]   such a huge empire.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.520]   - So vision is not enough to hold together the Soviet Union.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.360]   - I think the details are interesting.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.000]   I followed up on that a little bit,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.480]   'cause I was recently in countries like Kazakhstan,
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.360]   talked about the negotiations that were going on
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   and the breakup of the Soviet Union.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.800]   It's a very interesting story,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.160]   because it involves everything, Ukraine, of course,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.080]   everything that's going on now.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.840]   Some, what is it, 30 million Russians were left outside
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.300]   of the Soviet Union when it collapsed.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.120]   They had no home anymore.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.840]   They were homes in other countries, such as in Ukraine.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.220]   So it's an interesting story, and with repercussions today.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.520]   Kazakhstan is a good example of keeping a balance,
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.120]   keeping it neutral.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.520]   He played both sides,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.200]   because Yeltsin wanted him to join
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.100]   the Russian Confederation in a certain way
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.880]   where he'd be supporting, against Gorbachev.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.020]   There's a whole inward battle there.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.800]   I think the Ukraine came along with Yeltsin,
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.280]   as well as, I'm sorry, I don't remember now,
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.760]   but two other regions came with him,
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.240]   and that was a block that broke up the Soviet Union.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.280]   It was Yeltsin's plan to,
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.800]   and it was to make the Russian Federation, and they did.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.280]   - I would love to return back to JFK eventually,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.680]   'cause he's such a fascinating figure
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.640]   in the history of human civilization,
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.040]   but let me ask you, fast forward, in 2000,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.760]   Yeltsin was no longer president,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.440]   and Vladimir Putin became president.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.600]   You did a series of interviews with Vladimir Putin,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.080]   as you mentioned, over a period of two years,
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.500]   from 2015 to 2017.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.720]   Let me ask with a high-level question.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.700]   What was your goal with that conversation?
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.920]   - Oh, came out in 2017.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.260]   I guess I started 'em in 2014.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.600]   At that point, the Snowden affair had happened,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   and I was working on a movie on Snowden.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.120]   That happened in '13.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.400]   Ukraine happened in '14.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.920]   And one thing after another.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.240]   By '14, Putin was enemy number,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.240]   again, becoming a wanted man on the American list.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.620]   He was enemy, he was certainly in the top five.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.740]   But the animosity towards Putin
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.860]   had been growing since 2007 at Munich.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.900]   I remember that speech when he made it.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.020]   It's in my documentary.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.020]   It's a four-hour documentary, four different conversations.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.700]   I mean, we talked over two years, two and a half years.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.120]   But I remember that image of him at Munich
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.020]   making a very important speech about world harmony,
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.380]   about the balance necessary in the world.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:52.220]   And I remember the sneer, the sneer on John McCain's face.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.580]   He was in Munich, obviously eyeballing Putin and hating him.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.980]   And it was so evident that McCain had no belief whatsoever
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.300]   that he was almost treating him like,
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.020]   is it a communist or back?
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.860]   And we know that Putin was not a communist.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.100]   We know that Putin is very much a market man.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.540]   And he made it very clear
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.380]   and tried to keep an open climate,
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.020]   a new relationship with Europe.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.620]   But the United States always,
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.700]   certain people in the United States
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.840]   always saw that as a threat.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.620]   Like Putin is trying to take Europe away from us
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.820]   as if we own it, as if we have the right to own it.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.060]   But Putin was making the point,
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.500]   it's very important, about sovereignty.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.700]   Sovereignty for countries is crucial
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.980]   for this new world to have balance.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.220]   That's sovereignty for China, sovereignty for Russia,
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.900]   sovereignty for Iran, sovereignty for Venezuela,
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.260]   sovereignty for Cuba.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.980]   This is an idea that's crucial to the new world.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.700]   And I think the United States has never accepted that.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.480]   Sovereignty is not an idea that they can allow.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   You have to be obedient to the United States idea
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.260]   of so-called democracy and freedom.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.100]   But much more important is sovereignty for these countries.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.900]   And the United States has not obeyed that,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.020]   has not even acknowledged it.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.580]   And it never comes up.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.540]   - So from the perspective of the United States,
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.380]   when power centers arise in the world,
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.460]   you start to oppose those,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.740]   not because of the ideas,
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.420]   but merely because they have power.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.660]   - Isn't that at the heart of the doctrine
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.780]   of the neoconservatives?
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.940]   In the pact for the new American century,
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.240]   they wrote that in 1996, '97.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.700]   They said there shall be no emergence of a rival power.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.980]   It was very clear it was about power.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.480]   And they've stuck to that doctrine,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.340]   which is if you start to get dangerous in any way
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.640]   or have power, we're gonna knock you out.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.740]   Now that won't work.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.980]   I don't believe it can work.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.460]   And that is, fortunately,
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.140]   a policy the United States is following.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.180]   And the neoconservatives group, which is very small,
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.660]   but it's very strong apparently,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.020]   and their idea has resonated.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.640]   It was behind George Bush's invasion of Iraq.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.560]   It was part of not only Iraq,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.140]   but cleaning out the whole world,
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.220]   draining the swamp, going to Afghanistan first.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.640]   And then although Iraq had nothing to do
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.860]   with al-Qaeda's attack, going after Iraq.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.100]   And of course, 60-some other countries
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:33.100]   that were terrorism had some signs of,
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.280]   wherever America judged would be a dangerous country,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.300]   we had the right, you're either with us or against us.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.540]   Now that is a disastrous policy.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.180]   And led to one thing after another.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.160]   The Iraq War never learned a lesson.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.180]   The neoconservatives were never fired,
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.540]   never thrown out of office.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:55.620]   The people who prosecuted that war are still around.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.340]   Many of them are still around.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.260]   And they're obviously guiding America now.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.540]   - Let me return to this question of power.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.220]   Don't forget the sneer that I saw there.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.460]   That emblemized the United States reaction.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.580]   Also there were several other American representatives
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.180]   who were laughing, kind of mocking Putin.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.280]   It was very serious.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.100]   I felt there was a divide there.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.080]   So since then, I mean in a certain sense,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.760]   the Europe reaction to Putin is crucial.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.060]   And they were more with him back then.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.460]   And a big thing for America was always to keep NATO,
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.500]   to keep Europe in its pocket as a satellite.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.460]   And with this recent war, of course,
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.620]   they've succeeded beyond their dreams.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.780]   The Russians have fulfilled the fantasy
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.820]   of the United States to finally be this aggressor
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.180]   that they have pictured for years.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.640]   We can talk about that later.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   - But at that time, Europe had significant support
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.140]   for Putin.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.700]   The United States was sneering at Putin.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.380]   - That's correct, you can say that.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.300]   - And then, so there's this,
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:12.260]   there was uncertainty as to the direction,
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.420]   as to the future of Russia.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.900]   And that's exactly when you interviewed Vladimir Putin.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.020]   - I wanted to know what they thought
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.220]   because we couldn't get,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.340]   the information war that the United States
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.020]   was fighting against Russia was in evidence back then.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.380]   It was full out.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.500]   The condemnation of Russia on all fronts.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.820]   I never saw a positive article about Putin.
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.380]   Although when I traveled in the world,
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.700]   and I traveled a lot doing documentaries,
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.340]   it was very clear in the Middle East,
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.760]   in Africa, in Asia, there was respect for him.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.380]   That he was a man who was getting his job done
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.100]   in the interest of Russia.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.600]   He was, as I said in the documentary, a son of Russia.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.260]   Very much so, in the positive sense.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.140]   A son of Russia, not that he's out there
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:04.660]   trying to destroy the interests of other countries.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:09.020]   No, that he was out there to promote the interests of Russia
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.060]   but at the same time, keep a balance.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.160]   Keep the world into a harmony.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.980]   This has always been his picture.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.880]   Peace was always his idea.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.780]   In other words, he always referred to the United States
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.740]   in all these interviews as our partners.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.260]   And I said, "Will you stop using that word?
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.100]   "They're not."
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.800]   - Well--
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.380]   - And he was a little bit slow in waking up
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.120]   to what the United States was doing.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.460]   - Well, that said, he's one of the most powerful men
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.940]   in the world.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.980]   He was at that time.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.840]   And let me ask you the human question.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.460]   As the old adage goes, power corrupts
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.260]   and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.260]   Did you see any corroding effects of power on the man?
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.220]   Forget the political leader.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.920]   On just the human being that carries that power
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.440]   on his shoulders for so many years.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.000]   - Keep in mind that he's been,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.240]   unlike most modern leaders, he's been in office off and on
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.880]   because Medvedev was president
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.400]   and he was not literally in charge.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.080]   He took another appointment at that point
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.860]   but he was still very much involved.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.560]   But for 20 years, more or less,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.620]   he's been at the administrator of the state,
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.580]   the protector of the state.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.780]   And he's apparently done a good enough job
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.060]   that the Russian people have kept him there.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.000]   Because contrary to what many people think,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.460]   I really believe that if the Russian people didn't want him,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.340]   he would be out.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.260]   I firmly believe that.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.700]   I don't think you can go against the will of the people.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.900]   Now, it expresses itself in many ways.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.520]   At the ballot box and so forth.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.980]   But also in other ways in Russia.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.420]   There's a strong currents of opinion.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.580]   So contrary to what the position of him as a dictator,
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.260]   he wouldn't last if he was unpopular, number one.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.820]   Number two, Russia is much more divided than people know.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.420]   There's other factors in Russia.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.780]   There are always tensions around the Kremlin,
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.900]   who has power, who doesn't have power.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.620]   That's been going on for 100 years.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.380]   But the factions in Russia are very much there.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.100]   So when people refer to Russia as Putin, they're mistaken.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.000]   And they do this regularly in the New York papers
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.840]   and all this.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.980]   They say, Putin did this, Putin did that.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.060]   Putin's doing that.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.060]   But it's Russia that's doing it.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.180]   And that's what, there's a distinction there that I,
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.020]   it's changed.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.740]   In the old days, I would read about Khrushchev,
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.000]   but it was never Khrushchev personally.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.820]   It was about the Soviet Union.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.000]   There was respect for a country.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.020]   And when it started to get personal with Putin,
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.300]   it changed.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.340]   And our thinking changed in a negative way.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.140]   We no longer respected it as a country.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.460]   We were seen as a man.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.060]   And the man we had trashed repeatedly,
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.220]   repeatedly as a poisoner, as a murderer,
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.860]   none of which has ever been proven,
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.060]   but which has always been repeated and repeated
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.900]   to the point at which it becomes like an Orwell mantra.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.700]   It becomes like, he is, of course, a bad guy.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.240]   - Can I just ask you, as a great filmmaker,
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.280]   as a human being, what was it like talking
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.040]   to one of the most powerful men in the world?
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.280]   - Well, honestly, and I'm not naive,
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.740]   I've talked to a lot of powerful people.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.840]   In the movie business, there are powerful people,
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.600]   and many of them are corrupted.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.120]   I've talked to many people in my life.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.660]   I've been in the military.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.060]   I've seen, I've had other jobs.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.400]   I have to say, I found them to be a human being.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.620]   I just found them to be reasonable, calm.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.980]   I never saw 'em lose his temper.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.540]   And I mean, you have to understand that most people
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.100]   in the Western way of doing business get emotional.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.220]   I don't see that.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.700]   I saw him as a balanced man,
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.060]   as a man who had studied this like you have.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.240]   There's a calmness to you that it comes
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.420]   from studying the world
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.340]   and having a rational response to it.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.020]   It's interesting, his two daughters,
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.580]   one of them is very scientific,
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.500]   and the other one's doing very well in another profession.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.380]   But they're a thinking family.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.020]   His wife, too, was.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.380]   I can't talk for the new wife 'cause I don't know about it,
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.700]   but he kept his family with great respect.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.220]   He's raised his daughters right.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.300]   He served Yeltsin.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.700]   The way he looked at it, he served Yeltsin well.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.780]   And he never trashed Yeltsin.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.100]   Certainly a lot of people did.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.920]   But I asked him repeatedly,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.580]   was he an alcoholic, this or that?
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.020]   But he wouldn't even go that far.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.900]   He just respect.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.900]   And this man, Yeltsin, was in many ways
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.420]   ridiculed by the Russians.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.020]   He turned over the power
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.780]   because he felt like he was overwhelmed.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.180]   He turned over the power to this man because why?
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.860]   How many people had he fired before him?
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.940]   Several.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.460]   Several prime ministers, this, that.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.260]   Why did he turn power over to Mr. Putin?
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.700]   Because he respected him for his work ethic
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.860]   and his balance, his maturity.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.980]   And that's what I can say is I saw in him.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:18.720]   Poor person, from a poor family who worked his way up
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.820]   through the KGB.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.740]   Americans keep saying he's a KGB agent.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.960]   But it's like saying George Bush was a CIA agent.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.940]   But he became a, you grow.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.840]   You grow in your life.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.020]   And he went from the KGB to this technocratic position.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:38.020]   He dealt with many problems, including the Chechnyan War,
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.500]   which was a very difficult situation,
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.100]   as well as the Russian submarine problem.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.980]   Several things happened early in his,
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.900]   that gave him a lot of experience.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.980]   And he handled them all pretty well.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.100]   - Do you think he was an honest man?
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.940]   - I do.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.900]   Now, of course, the question of money,
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.300]   the charges that he's the richest man in the world
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.180]   are ludicrous.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.360]   Certainly doesn't live like it or act like it.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.340]   If you're rich, I've been around a lot of rich people
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.180]   in my life.
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.500]   You'd probably have too in America.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.460]   You run into them.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.700]   So many of them are arrogant.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.380]   - I'm actually good friends now
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.140]   with the richest man in the world.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:13.960]   - Oh, of course.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.180]   I saw your interview with Mr. Musk, who I appreciate.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.020]   At least he speaks freely.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.780]   I'm positive about him owning Twitter
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.100]   because Twitter has become censorship city,
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.100]   as has all the major tech.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.820]   I mean, the censorship that we are now seeing
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.620]   in the United States is so un-American and shocking to me.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   - And he is a resistance to that.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.460]   That is true.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.340]   - Yeah, I like Musk for that, just for that only.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.380]   But I also appreciate him, his adventuresome,
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.700]   his nature and his desire to explore the world
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.060]   and to ask questions.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.820]   - Yeah, there's certain ways you sound
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.080]   when you speak freely.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.260]   There's certain ways you sound,
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.540]   a man sounds when he speaks freely.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.380]   - Yeah.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.420]   - He speaks freely.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.900]   And it's refreshing.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.740]   - Yeah.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.500]   - No matter whether you're rich or not,
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.320]   it doesn't matter.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.020]   When you speak freely, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.500]   - Actually, Musk, at a major point,
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.020]   going back to nuclear energy,
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.580]   he never believed in it at first, apparently.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.180]   He was going for batteries, right?
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.300]   And he put a lot of money into batteries.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.700]   He made bigger and bigger batteries.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.300]   But it just, as Bill Gates has said,
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.340]   it's just, it's not gonna get us there.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.180]   - Yeah.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.220]   - And now I think Musk is on another path.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.900]   He understands the need for nuclear.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.700]   - Yeah, he's a supporter of nuclear.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.060]   We're jumping around.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.940]   - Poon never asked for one thing, never.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.940]   It was an interview, it was free form.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.580]   Ask anything you want.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.480]   No restrictions, no rules.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.140]   As with Castro, frankly,
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.780]   Castro did the same thing as did Chavez.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.660]   So I've had good luck in interviewing free-ranging subjects,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.420]   people willing to express themselves.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.300]   He's much more guarded than Castro or Chavez,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.180]   because as you know, he's setting government policy
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.980]   when he speaks, and anything he says
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.020]   can be taken out of context.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.900]   - But there was no restrictions on what to talk about,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.740]   none of that.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.900]   - Nor any desire to see anything before we published it.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.600]   No need to check it with them.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.780]   It was completely--
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.980]   - Do you think he watched the final product?
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.220]   - Yes, I do, but I don't think he made judgments on it.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.420]   I think he was pleased.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.300]   He doesn't go either way.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.460]   You see, he's pleased.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.980]   I mean, it went well, he's happy for us.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.380]   But I don't think he had great enthusiasm,
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.900]   expressed it to me.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.620]   He trusted me, and you could see the way
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.140]   he dealt with me each time.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.360]   He warmed up to me.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.740]   Four times, you know, the first time
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.340]   it might have been a little stiff.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.220]   You're asking, you don't know who you're dealing with,
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.580]   and so forth, I understand that.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.060]   But he's used to it now.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.420]   He's done a lot of press.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.540]   The worst press he's done, frankly,
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.340]   has been the American press.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.220]   And not because of his fault,
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.420]   but because of the way they have treated him.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.880]   If you look at the interviews, they're awful.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.100]   They put, first of all, I noticed one thing
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.020]   as a filmmaker right away, they use a dub, an overdub.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.540]   They put a Russian speaker for everything he says,
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.900]   who's much harsher.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.140]   He speaks Russian in a much harsher manner
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.620]   than actually Putin does.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.180]   Who's very, if you, on my interview,
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.140]   I left him in his original language with translator.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.260]   I think that's important, because he expresses himself
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.400]   very clearly and calmly.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.340]   When you listen to the American broadcast,
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.940]   it's a belligerent person who looks like
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.980]   he's about to bang his shoe on the table.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:37.280]   And secondly, the questions are highly aggressive
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.120]   from the beginning.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.900]   There's no sense of rapport, there's no sense of,
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.660]   well, it's why, Mr. Putin, did you poison this person?
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.860]   Why, Mr. Putin, did you kill this person?
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.900]   Why are you a murderer?
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.260]   I mean, it's blunt, blunt negative television.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.960]   - Yeah, it's not just aggressive.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.100]   So I obviously speak Russian, so I get to appreciate
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.660]   both the original and the translation.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.900]   And it's not just aggressive, it's very shallow.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.880]   They're not looking to understand.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.460]   To me, aggression is okay, if that's the way
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.220]   you wanna approach it, but it should be,
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.580]   there should be underlying kind of empathy
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.140]   for another human being in order to be able to understand.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:23.460]   And so some of the worst interviews I've ever listened to
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.680]   is by American Press of Vladimir Putin.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.600]   So NBC and all those kinds of organizations,
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.960]   it's very painful to watch.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.080]   - And you saw the reception to the Putin interviews
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.380]   in America was hostile without seeing it.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.440]   So many people criticized my series
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.080]   without having seen it.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.540]   Even, I went on a show, a television show
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.040]   with this famous Colbert, you know,
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.720]   he's very famous in America.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   And I was shocked on the show to find out
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.880]   that he hadn't seen anything of the four hours.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.160]   He was just attacking Putin.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.640]   And through me, I was complicit,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.480]   therefore I was a Putin supporter.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.880]   And the show was a disaster.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.920]   It's one of my worst television shows.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.640]   I actually, I had to shut up and get off the air.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.760]   I mean, at some point it was embarrassing.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.160]   Because the audience too was clapping for Colbert
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.320]   on anything he said.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.060]   - Well, as an interviewer in that situation,
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.240]   because between you and Vladimir Putin,
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.080]   there was camaraderie, there was joking,
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   there was, are you worried,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.960]   do you put that into the calculation
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.620]   when you're making a film with somebody
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.520]   that could be lying to you, that could be evil?
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.960]   You talk about Castro, you talk about,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.760]   so are you worried about how charisma of a man
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.880]   across the table from you can delude you?
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.600]   - No, I take that into account.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.720]   I absolutely take that into account.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.800]   I know, I mean, doing Castro, he's a wonderful speaker,
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.320]   he's charismatic, so is Chavez.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.040]   Look at those interviews.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.560]   I took it into account.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.360]   But Putin doesn't play that game.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.520]   He doesn't charm you, he doesn't try to overwhelm you
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.760]   with his bon ami at all.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.560]   He just says, "Ask your question,
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.240]   "I'll give you my answer straight.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.080]   "Here it is.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.240]   "And he analyzes it.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.500]   "This is the history of NATO,
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.100]   "this is the history of our relationship
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.360]   "with the United States.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.900]   "How many times have we tried to talk to them
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.660]   "about such and such and such and such,
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.960]   "and each time we get nowhere."
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.380]   In fact, it's a very,
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.440]   I would like to get along with the United States so much,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.800]   he's saying it so clearly in all his words.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.760]   - So to play devil's advocate.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.600]   - But he's not making a big deal about it.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.800]   - But there is a charisma and a calmness.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   - Yes, there is.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.680]   - So like, let's just calm everything down,
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.000]   it's simple facts.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.080]   That, you can call,
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.320]   so there's like the Hitler thing,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.560]   which is screaming, being very loud,
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.120]   charismatic, strong message and so on.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.500]   And then there's a Putin style,
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.600]   I'm not comparing those two.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.880]   There's the Putin style communication of calmness.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.480]   And that, at least to me, my personality,
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.220]   that can be very captivating,
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.200]   is bringing everything down, the facts are simple.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.860]   But then when you say the facts are simple,
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.440]   you can now start lying.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.320]   And you don't know what's true and what's lies.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.160]   - It behooves you to do some research.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.000]   - Yes.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.280]   - And frankly, when it comes to research,
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.100]   you're gonna have a problem,
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.080]   because if you go to the Americanized versions
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.560]   of Russian history, you're gonna run into a problem.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.680]   And that includes even Wikipedia.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.160]   They will tell you things
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.560]   that are just not factually supported.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.520]   So it was a problem in terms of,
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.040]   if you read all the books in the American library
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.320]   about Putin, there's nothing positive about it.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.840]   They're awful, they're awful.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.680]   And a lot of them, I had a good relationship
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.160]   with Professor Stephen Cohen,
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.480]   who's the most, I think,
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.320]   one of the most informed men on Russia.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.960]   He'd done a lot of research, all his life.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.680]   And knew Gorbachev very well.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.200]   And was very analytical about all these situations
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.960]   that happened before his death in 2019.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.560]   I'm not quite sure when Stephen died,
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.040]   but I knew him well.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   And he gave me the best information I could get.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.360]   I would go to Stephen and I'd say,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.200]   I'm confused here, tell me the history
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.080]   of this accusation of poisoning against this person,
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:27.920]   and so forth.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.160]   And he'd explain it to me in, I think,
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.800]   very, the clearest ways that I understood.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.160]   And he said to me once, he said,
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.760]   most of these people who go to Russia
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.560]   and write this stuff about Putin are going off the internet.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.640]   The internet has really been a source
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.400]   of a lot of fractured facts here.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.760]   He said, pure analysis.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.880]   You have to go back to the texts,
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.440]   all the documents, and to really fully understand.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.760]   But he spoke Russian.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:59.040]   And his wife and him, Katerina Von Huvel,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.440]   who's an editor, publisher of The Nation magazine,
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.280]   would go to Russia several times a year
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.360]   and talk to their friend Gorbachev.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.440]   And Gorbachev's an interesting character.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.440]   I talked to him, interviewed him.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.400]   Not interviewed him, but talked to him at length.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.360]   And I like him very much.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.160]   And I saw the divide, as you saw in the Putin interviews,
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.360]   between Gorbachev and Putin early on in the interviews.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.440]   You sense Putin doesn't particularly care for Gorbachev
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.000]   because he, in his point of view,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.520]   he screwed up the administration of Russia
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.400]   and is responsible for so much of the disaster
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.000]   of leaving all those people outside the Soviet Union.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.400]   So these are problems that continue into the future.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   But they see each other, or he knows he's there
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.520]   at the May Day Parade we filmed.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.820]   And his attitude is funny, it's very human.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.480]   He says, you know, he's welcome.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.760]   He's a pensioner, he's done his duty.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.720]   There's no animus towards him.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.000]   Even when Gorbachev in the early days,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.260]   as you remember, criticized him for his manners
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.160]   in terms of democracy.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.760]   But I don't know that that, you know,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.800]   that becomes a quarrel.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.840]   But frankly, by the end of the situation,
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.360]   it's very clear that Gorbachev has now moved
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.680]   closer and closer to the,
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.920]   says Russia is now really under attack.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.640]   This is, he sees it.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.400]   He sees where the United States has made a concerted effort
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.840]   to undermine Putin.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.400]   And he's repeated this several times about Ukraine.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.280]   I think you've seen what he said.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   You can quote it.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.040]   And Gorbachev is, we have no respect for Gorbachev even.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   Even at this juncture.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.480]   When can you see Gorbachev's ideas printed
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.200]   in most American newspapers?
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   Very rarely, very rarely.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.120]   And recently not at all.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.600]   So Gorbachev, who was our hero back in,
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   the American hero back in 1980s,
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.580]   has now been condemned to the garbage can,
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.780]   so to speak, of history.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.360]   - Well, in this complicated geopolitical picture
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.440]   you just outlined, can we talk about
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.160]   the recent invasion of Ukraine?
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.160]   So you wrote on Facebook a pretty eloquent analysis,
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.600]   I think on March 3rd.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.080]   Let me just read a small section of that
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.760]   just to give context, and maybe we can talk
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.880]   a little bit more about both Russia and the man, Putin.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.280]   You wrote, "Although the United States
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.960]   "has many wars of aggression on its conscience,
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.720]   "it doesn't justify Mr. Putin's aggression in Ukraine.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.420]   "A dozen wrongs don't make a right.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.400]   "Russia was wrong to invade.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.500]   "It has made too many mistakes.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.360]   "One, underestimating Ukraine resistance.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.040]   "Two, overestimating the military ability
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.860]   "to achieve its objective.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.400]   "Three, underestimating Europe's reaction,
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.680]   "especially Germany, upping its military contribution
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.940]   "to NATO, which they've resisted for some 20 years.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.540]   "Even Switzerland has joined the cause.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:11.500]   "Russia will be more isolated than ever from the West.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:15.040]   "Four, underestimating the enhanced power of NATO,
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.980]   "which will now put more pressure on Russia's borders.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.940]   "Five, probably putting Ukraine into NATO.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.760]   "Six, underestimating the damage to its own economy
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.300]   "and certainly creating more internal resistance in Russia.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.460]   "Seven, creating a major readjustment of power
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.720]   "in its oligarch class.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   "Eight, putting cluster and vacuum bombs into play.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.220]   "Nine, and underestimating the power
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.360]   "of social media worldwide."
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.700]   And you go on for a while giving a much broader picture
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.840]   of the history and the geopolitics of all of this.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.800]   So now, a little bit later,
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.760]   two months later, what are your thoughts
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.140]   about the invasion of Ukraine?
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:08.640]   - Well, it's very hard to be honest in this regard
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   because the West has brought down a curtain here.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.360]   Anyone who questions the invasion of Ukraine
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   and its consequences is an enemy of the people,
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.760]   it's become so difficult.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.000]   I've never seen in my lifetime ever
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   such a wall of propaganda as I've seen in the West.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.880]   And that includes France too
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.000]   because I was there recently and England.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.400]   England is of course really vociferous.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.240]   It's shocking to me how quickly Europe moved
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.480]   in this direction and that includes Germany.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.360]   I have German friends who expressed to me
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.280]   their shock over Ukraine.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.120]   I have Italian friends, same thing.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.880]   And Italy of course has been perhaps
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:04.000]   the most understanding and compassionate of countries.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.020]   So it's quite evident that there's a united,
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.840]   and this attests to the power of the United States.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.400]   And of course you have Finland,
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.200]   which has generally been reasonable jumping
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.640]   and talking about joining NATO and Sweden too.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:26.240]   Generally there's been some more restraint in Europe.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.120]   That's what surprised me the most, Europe.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.600]   How quickly they fell into this NATO basket,
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.280]   which is very dangerous for Europe, very dangerous.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.880]   This goes back to my idea
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.440]   what I was saying earlier about sovereignty.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.400]   These countries don't really give me a sense
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.440]   that they have sovereignty over their own countries.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.640]   They don't feel--
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.000]   - The European nations.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.080]   - I'm obviously intuition here is working.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.360]   I just don't feel that they have freedom
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.720]   to say what they really think and they're scared to say it.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:03.480]   When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003,
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.960]   I remember with great, in a sense, satisfaction
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.480]   that at least France, Chirac,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.560]   who I had not really known much about,
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.160]   stood up and said the United States,
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.240]   we're not gonna join you in this expedition,
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.000]   basically into madness.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.900]   Schroeder in Germany, same thing.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.320]   Of course, Putin condemned the invasion
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.280]   and Putin had been an ally of the United States
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.640]   since 9/11, if you remember correctly,
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.320]   and had called Bush and they were getting along.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.080]   So even Putin said, I won't go, don't go into Iraq.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.920]   This is not the solution.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.900]   He didn't oppose Afghanistan, but he opposed Iraq.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.240]   So Chirac and Schroeder stood for the old Europe.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.920]   I remember de Gaulle, Charles de Gaulle,
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.440]   he was independent of the United States.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.640]   Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.680]   because he saw the dangers of NATO,
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.940]   which is to say you have to fight an American war
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.540]   when they say, and they put nuclear weapons
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.040]   on your territory in England and France
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.020]   and Italy and Germany, when they do that,
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.080]   you're hitched to this superpower
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.000]   and you have no say in what they're gonna do.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.120]   If they declare war and they use your territory,
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.840]   you're gonna be involved in a major conflict.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.080]   I'm talking about sovereignty.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.600]   Where is that sovereignty?
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.960]   They don't have it.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.720]   And that has influenced their mindset for years now,
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.280]   since 1940, since, well, de Gaulle was the '60s.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.960]   He actually reversed the whole flow
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.080]   and he was, I think it was Sarkozy
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.040]   who put France back into NATO.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:46.140]   And now it's Macron, I hope,
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.300]   because he was talking to Putin,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.400]   would at least have an independent viewpoint
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.800]   that could be helpful here.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.860]   But he rolled it up.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.360]   He may have told Putin something else,
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.000]   but within days he had rolled it up
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.560]   and gone along with the United States position,
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.140]   which was enforced by the United States in a very fierce way.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.840]   The propaganda, as I say,
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.280]   I don't know how much time you spend in America,
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.300]   but it was vicious and everything was anti-Russian.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.920]   Russia were killing all these people,
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   were shooting down civilians.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.820]   Although there was no proof of it,
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.780]   there was just, these are the accidents of war,
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.520]   but all of a sudden it was a campaign of criminality
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.680]   and they were talking about
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.680]   bringing Putin into a war crime trial.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.080]   Well, why didn't they talk like that
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:33.500]   when Iraq was going on and Bush was killing far more people?
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.280]   Or for that matter, why were they not talking
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.440]   about the killings in Donbass and Lugansk
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.440]   during that 2014 to 2022 period?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.200]   That is what is, it's a crime.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.560]   There were so many people that were killed,
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.640]   many of them innocent, many of them innocent.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.880]   - What would be the way for Vladimir Putin
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.880]   to stop the killing in Donbass
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.160]   without the invasion of Ukraine?
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.720]   - Yeah, that's a very good question
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.200]   and I've asked that several times
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.560]   and I don't have the, I have not talked to him
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.620]   since about two years now.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:13.400]   It's a very good question.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.580]   - What's the mistakes, what the human mistakes
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.280]   and the leadership mistakes made by Vladimir Putin?
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.120]   - It's a very good question.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.960]   You see, what the American press has not said
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.240]   and the Western press has not said
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.080]   is that on February 24, was it?
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.720]   That was on that day when they invaded.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.300]   The day before, if you check the logs
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.800]   of the European organization that was supervising,
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.880]   was in the field in Ukraine.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.000]   These are neutral observers.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.360]   They were seeing heavier and heavier artillery fire
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.360]   going into Donbass from the Ukrainian side.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:55.600]   So they had, apparently Ukraine had 110,000 troops
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.440]   on the border.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.920]   They were about to invade Donbass.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.280]   That was the plan.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.800]   That's what I think.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.640]   Russia, because of the buildup on the border of Donbass
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.240]   brought 130, they say 130,000 troops
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:13.260]   to the area near Donbass, right?
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.880]   So you have buildup of forces on both sides
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.260]   but you wouldn't know that from reading the press
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.100]   in the West.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.080]   You'd believe that the Russians suddenly
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.560]   put all these men into the situation
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.040]   with the idea of invading Ukraine,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.520]   not only Donbass but invading all of Ukraine
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.280]   and getting rid of the, decapitating the government there
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.820]   which is all assumption.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.920]   We don't know what they would intend it to do.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.240]   - But you at the time, is it a lot of people
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.800]   thought that the, all the talk of the invasion,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.480]   Russian invasion of Ukraine is just propaganda.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.320]   It's not gonna happen.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.560]   It's very unlikely to happen.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.360]   - I think many of us thought that the United States
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.840]   is building this up into an invasion.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.360]   In other words, that is the nature of false flag operations
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.960]   when you create this propaganda.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.820]   They are going to invade, they are going to invade
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:05.620]   and then when they invaded, the United States
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.500]   was completely ready and all their allies
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.820]   were completely ready for the invasion, correct?
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.180]   So why did Putin do that?
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.100]   He fell into this, theoretically into this trap
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.020]   set by the United States.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.220]   Here you're telling all your allies across the board
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.880]   they are going to invade.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.280]   But you--
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.420]   - Why do you think he did it?
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:26.140]   So here, is it madness or is it--
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:26.980]   - No, no, it's not madness.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.420]   - Strategic calculation?
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.500]   - Perhaps.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.540]   This one I cannot answer you faithfully
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:34.700]   because first of all, we don't know what he was told.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.300]   If he was indeed getting the right intelligence estimates
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:43.300]   from what I said earlier in that essay I wrote,
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:47.660]   you would think he was not well informed, perhaps,
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.620]   about the degree of cooperation he would get
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:56.620]   from the Ukrainian Russians in Ukraine.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.360]   That would be one factor, that he wasn't,
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.380]   he didn't assess the operation correctly.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.220]   Remember this, Mr. Putin has had this cancer
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.140]   and I think he's licked it, but he's also been isolated
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.560]   because of COVID.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.060]   And some people would argue that the isolation
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:18.820]   from normal activity, which he was meeting people
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.020]   face to face, but all of a sudden he was meeting people
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.980]   across the table 100 yards away or whatever,
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.420]   10 yards away, it was very hard.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.220]   Perhaps he lost touch with, contact with people.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.460]   - So it's not just power, it's the very simple fact
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.300]   that you're just distant from humans.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.540]   - I'm speculating, I don't know.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.620]   I see that and I also, perhaps he thought in his mind
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:45.060]   that there would be a faster resolution
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.300]   that the Ukrainian, because the evidence had been
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.500]   that the Ukrainian Russians, the Ukrainian army
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.300]   had folded so many times and that they were only backed up
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.840]   and they were stiffened by the resistance
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.380]   of the Nazi oriented Azov battalions.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.260]   That was a factor of course.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.100]   And that is a big factor for the Russians
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.820]   because these people are very tough, they rush.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.460]   See, what people don't understand is that Ukraine
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.460]   since 2014 has been a terror state.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.660]   They've been run, anytime a Ukrainian has expressed
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:23.660]   any understanding of the Russian Ukrainian position,
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.280]   they've been threatened by the state.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.720]   From 2014 to 2022, there's been a set of hideous murders
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.240]   that people don't even know about in the West.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.920]   Journalists, people who speak out, liberals,
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.000]   people who, I interviewed Viktor Medvedev
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.700]   who they make out to be some kind of horrible person,
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.420]   but Medvedev was a very important figure
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.240]   in the administration of Kushma,
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.040]   the first Ukrainian prime minister in the 1990s
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.320]   and he did a great job on the economy.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.700]   He was a very thoughtful man.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.300]   If you'll see my interview, it's called Ukraine Revealed.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.660]   He's very thoughtful about the future of Ukraine.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.700]   He doesn't want to go back and join Russia.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.900]   He wants it to be an independent country.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.760]   Ukraine is independent and he wants it to be
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.540]   a functioning economic democracy, more or less a democracy
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.920]   if you can get that, but between,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.940]   that exists in a neutral state, a neutral state,
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.540]   which Ukraine used to be before 2014.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.100]   It was neutral from '91 to 2014.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.380]   Neutral, very important.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.720]   Under Poroshenko, it just immediately went
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.760]   into an anti-Soviet Cold War position
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.120]   as an ally of the United States.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.120]   And my point was that it was a very dangerous place,
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.140]   Ukraine, people were being killed,
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.000]   death squads were out there.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.680]   Medvedev, they stripped him of his television stations.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.480]   Very suddenly, this is Zelensky, the new president,
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.500]   said Zelensky was elected on a peace platform.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.480]   Remember that.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.820]   70% of the country was for him to make peace with Russia.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.820]   He didn't even try to make peace with Russia.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.300]   Did he attend any of the Minsk II agreements?
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.660]   Did he visit, did he pay any attention to Putin?
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.500]   Did he go to Russia?
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.900]   No, not at all.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.580]   The moment he got into office, I'm convinced
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   that the militant sector of the right sector parties
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.580]   of Ukraine let him know that you will not make a deal
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:30.180]   with Russia, there'll be no concessions to Russia.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.260]   This is very dangerous.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.540]   This is where this attitude that's very, very hostile
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.980]   to Russia has hurt us.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.980]   The whole world is being hurt by this.
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.500]   And no one calls them out.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.900]   No one calls them out.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:45.220]   Zelensky backed off from his platform
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.740]   as running for president.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.060]   And as president has been ineffective,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.220]   did nothing to promote it.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.180]   On the contrary, went the other way
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:56.700]   and seemed to support the Ukrainian aggression.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.440]   - Well, he found his support in this war.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.820]   You've revealed through your work some of the most honest
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.860]   and dark aspects of war.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.940]   Nevertheless, this is a war
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.740]   and there's a humanitarian crisis.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.740]   Millions of people, refugees escaping Ukraine.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.060]   What do you think about the human cost of this war
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.900]   initiated by-- - It's horrible.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:26.140]   - Whoever, just as you write, whatever the context,
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:30.620]   whatever NATO, whatever pressure, as you wrote,
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.860]   Russia was wrong to invade.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.420]   - Okay, yeah, let's get back to the original question.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.300]   You said, what was he thinking at that time?
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.900]   We never answered that.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.900]   Now, by the way, among those people who are terrorists,
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.460]   who've been ruined by this war,
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:53.100]   you have to include the 2014 to 2022 Ukrainian Russians.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.100]   14,000 were killed, not necessarily by,
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.080]   some of them by maybe accident, this and that,
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.800]   but certainly a large number of that
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.740]   is responsible to the Ukrainian military
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.100]   and the Nazi related battalions
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.860]   who have done a good job of death squatting that whole area.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.920]   And remember, I did a film about Salvador.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.980]   I know a little bit about death squads and how they work.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:17.640]   And I know about paramilitaries,
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.900]   because in South America, they're all over the place.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.780]   America supports, hates Venezuela,
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.380]   goes on about Venezuela.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.820]   Do they tell you anything about Colombia?
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.020]   It's next door neighbor.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.420]   Colombia, for years, has been plagued by paramilitaries
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.620]   that are right wing.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.380]   And the United States has said nothing about them,
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.020]   except occasionally there's a newspaper report now.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.700]   So this support of death squads by the United States
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.680]   is all over the world.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.620]   It's not just in South America and Central America,
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.420]   where we see plenty of evidence of it.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.420]   It's here too.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.540]   And this is what's horrible about this whole thing,
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.940]   this hypocrisy of America,
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.940]   that they can support such evil, such evil.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:58.640]   Now, going back to your larger question about,
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.980]   yes, it's a terrible refugee disaster.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.860]   But again, we'd have to get the numbers.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.500]   Let's get the numbers and get the evidence,
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:09.060]   because I would ask you, I'm not sure at this point,
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:13.460]   whether more civilians were killed before 2022 in Donbass
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.900]   than have been killed in this latest--
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.900]   - So we can't talk about this without,
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.860]   we can't talk about the invasion of Ukraine
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.380]   without considering the full war
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.500]   between Russia and Ukraine since 2014.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.540]   - That's correct, absolutely.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.540]   And take the toll on both sides,
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.880]   and you might be surprised by the result.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.460]   I think the Russian military, of course, I'm not there,
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.540]   and I'm not, this is speculation.
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.240]   The Russian military has slowed down,
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.660]   and part of that reason is not to keep
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.100]   the civilian corridors open.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.180]   And I think the Ukrainian military
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.700]   has made it more difficult on purpose,
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.260]   especially some of these battalions
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.980]   that are death squad battalions have gone out of their way
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:55.720]   to keep the civilians locked into these cities in danger,
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.420]   because it's in their interest to do so.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.680]   So there's no reason why Ukrainian military,
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.340]   who have killed Ukrainian civilians for years,
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:06.180]   would change their policies.
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.620]   They would have no compunctions about wiping out,
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.340]   for example, people with white armbands in Bukha.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.160]   - Okay, as to what Putin was thinking at the time,
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.260]   I wondered this, and I still do, I said,
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.980]   okay, so Putin can say,
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.920]   let's say the Ukrainian government
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.740]   wants to now invade Donbass.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.620]   This is on February 23, and they have artillery
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.020]   that pepper in the whole place.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.580]   They're gonna go in, and they're gonna get Donbass back.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.900]   What do you do?
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.700]   And you have Russian separatists,
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.420]   who are Russian-Ukrainians, who are gonna fight.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:49.200]   How far do you go in supporting them?
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.620]   Can Russia at this point say, well, we can't help you?
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:52.600]   You have to get along.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.980]   You have to somehow, you have to be absorbed by the Kiev.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.140]   You're gonna be absorbed by them,
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.940]   and they're not gonna give you autonomy,
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.700]   and you have to live with them,
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.460]   and there's gonna be a price to pay.
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:05.860]   You could do that, and you could also say,
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.140]   well, we open our borders to Donbass.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.420]   You can come into our country, you can leave,
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.740]   and we will help you to resettle,
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.400]   and that would be a reasonable approach.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.700]   So you take it to the next stage, as Putin's thinking.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.700]   You take it to the next stage.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.140]   You stall.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.700]   It's harder for your people.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.080]   Of course, there's pressure on Putin
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.820]   from inside his own government to say,
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.660]   what are you gonna do?
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.900]   I mean, you can't do this.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.660]   There's a lot of nationalists in Russia.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.540]   They would certainly bring, it would be to his,
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.380]   they'd say Putin is weak, and that's the biggest rap
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.100]   you can ever give a Russian leader,
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.280]   is you're weak, you can't get anything done.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.820]   So there would have been some damage,
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.900]   but let's say he goes with that, and he says,
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   okay, we know what the United States intention is.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.660]   It's to get rid of me, regime change,
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.300]   and to get another Yeltsin in.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.920]   That's what they want, and they will go to any ends.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.220]   They will destroy Ukraine, if necessary,
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.500]   but they want regime change in Russia,
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.740]   and then after they do that, of course,
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.500]   they'll go after China, but that's the ultimate policy
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.340]   of the United States.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.580]   This is a country that has no compunctions
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.780]   about going all the way, and it will use hypocrisy
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.140]   in all the news propaganda in the world
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.400]   to get what it wants.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.780]   This is the equivalent, frankly,
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   of Germany's goals in World War II, world domination.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.300]   There's no question, in my mind,
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.540]   but we're going about it in our way,
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.740]   as opposed to Hitler's way.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.060]   So just to finish your thought, where do they go?
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.900]   What's stage two?
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:37.660]   Okay, let's say they take, Ukraine takes back Donbass.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.300]   Let's say people get killed in large quantities.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.780]   So we now to the next stage.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.180]   We're finished with the Minsk II agreements
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.620]   that we never adhered to.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.460]   So what does Russia do?
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.660]   They wait for the next aggression,
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.740]   which is gonna come in one form or another,
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:56.500]   perhaps in Georgia, I don't know what the US is thinking,
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.500]   but the US cannot say Russia has done anything.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.180]   They have not used violence to stop Donbass
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.940]   from belonging back to Ukraine, right?
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.100]   So you're in a new setup now.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.260]   It's a whole thing rearranges.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.580]   Now you have, but you still have nuclear weapons.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.820]   You still have Russian nuclear weapons,
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.540]   and they're serious weapons.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.560]   They're very well-developed, crude,
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.320]   but not as refined as the American nuclear force,
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.700]   but powerful.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.980]   That becomes another game.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.580]   Then you open another chess board,
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.700]   and you still haven't been condemned.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.380]   The sanctions haven't been imposed.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.460]   That's a new, it's a new game.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.860]   Could he have done, could he have lived with that?
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.140]   That's the question I ask myself.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.960]   - So you see ultimately Ukraine today
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   as a battleground for the proxy war
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.620]   between Russia and the United States?
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.140]   - The United States would have then NATO-ized Ukraine,
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.140]   or certainly put more weapons in.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.880]   You know, the United States has already done a lot
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.760]   in Ukraine with intelligence, with training advisors.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.740]   The intelligence aspect of the Ukrainian army
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.380]   has been raised enormously
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.100]   by the United States contribution.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.880]   - Is it possible for you to steal man,
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.980]   to play devil's advocate against yourself,
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:11.900]   and say that Vladimir Zelensky
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation,
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.180]   and in a way against Russia,
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.060]   but also against the United States,
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.780]   it just happens that for now,
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.940]   the United States is a useful ally.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.100]   But ultimately, the man, the leader,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.580]   is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   - I would think he thinks so, yes.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.500]   And he could say that, but he's not acknowledging
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.260]   that the sovereignty of his nation was stolen in 2014
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:43.260]   with a coup d'etat that brought this right sector into power
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.180]   and they have controlled the country since then.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.100]   It's thuggery what they've done.
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.060]   The Medvedev case is a case in point.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.800]   They just take what they need.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.860]   They go to a house and they have,
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.380]   how many people have been killed?
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.380]   Serious people, journalists killed by these battalions.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.540]   That's what people don't realize.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.140]   In other words, you can't speak out.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.380]   A person like me would have been on the death list
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.020]   on day five.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.460]   There's no opposition to Zelensky.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.980]   So he doesn't have a real sovereignty.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.820]   It was a stolen sovereignty.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.420]   - Do you think President Zelensky
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:24.180]   would accept an interview with you today?
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:28.580]   - Actually, since I made Ukraine on Fire documentary,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.940]   which perhaps you've seen,
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.940]   which records the incidents of 2014
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.820]   and the Maidan demonstrations
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.620]   and shows you the dishonesty behind it.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.980]   No, I think that they've been very negative
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:46.300]   and they would kill me if I was in Ukraine.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.380]   I mean, they don't have any, these people are very tough.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.740]   These are as rough as they come, in my opinion.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.080]   And I've seen rough in my life.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.980]   I mean, these guys are not playing with fair at all.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.340]   These are death squads.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.220]   No, I don't think,
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.780]   and Zelensky would have nothing to do with it,
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.420]   but of course it would be dangerous for me.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.900]   And they've been very hostile in their policies.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.300]   Any Ukrainians abroad are also threatened.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.820]   In other words, you could be in Paris,
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:16.060]   but if you speak out too much,
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.820]   I think Ukrainians know that they're gonna be targeted.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.660]   And I think that's part of the reason they don't talk.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.800]   A lot of them, you have to take the anti-Russian line,
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.480]   but I think a lot of them are divided.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.120]   - So you think you would be killed
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.000]   and Zelensky wouldn't even know about it?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:31.920]   So there is--
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.800]   - Well, I don't think, if I was killed, certainly abroad,
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.880]   no, they wouldn't kill me abroad.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.600]   I think they'd figure out a way.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.320]   - No, no, no, no, if you travel to Ukraine, I mean.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.600]   - I wouldn't get in, I wouldn't get in.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.520]   Except through Donbass, I'd come through.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.120]   There are some Americans in Donbass
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.040]   who are reporting on the war there.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.600]   And I read their reports, actually.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.760]   They're pretty interesting
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.180]   because they show you the cruelty of what's going on,
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.460]   but never mentioned in the West, never.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.220]   That's what's so strange about this.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.980]   This is a modern world that we're living in,
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.020]   and yet this information is not coming out
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.500]   to the mass of the people.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.700]   And on the contrary, the United States has closed down
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:11.700]   all the RT, all the information centers
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.540]   that are possible alternative news
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.100]   getting to the American people.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.460]   They've seriously made an effort,
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:20.080]   and the BBC, English, and France.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.460]   I was shocked when France closed RT down
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.460]   because RT is actually pretty good.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.240]   Yes, they may, it's called, there are distortions,
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.380]   but you know as well as I do because you speak
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.280]   that RT has done a very brave job
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.360]   of putting correspondents into the field
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.660]   in very dangerous positions,
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.660]   and they've gotten great footage
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.800]   of some of the violence that's going on.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.760]   - Well, given the wall of propaganda in the West,
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.420]   I also see the wall of propaganda in Russia,
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   the wall of propaganda in China,
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.940]   the wall of propaganda in India.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.260]   What do we do with these walls of propaganda?
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:55.500]   I talked to-- - Yes, let's talk about Russia
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.360]   'cause you would know more about it,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.780]   but my last experience there, newspapers,
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.440]   it was more interesting, put it this way.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.580]   When I went to Venezuela, the United States was saying
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.340]   back then that Chavez controlled the press.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.020]   I get to Venezuela, and there's nothing
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.980]   but criticism of Chavez in the press.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.360]   It was owned by the oligarchs of Venezuela
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.680]   and who hated him, so it was across the board.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.580]   That's why Chavez opened the state television,
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:26.200]   spent more money on it, and advertised his point of view
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.660]   through state television.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.220]   But in Russia, what I saw was criticism.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.520]   I met with a publisher who got the Nobel Prize
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.140]   of that famous newspaper, and his point of view
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.340]   at that time when I spoke to him a few years ago
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:44.360]   was we're operating, there is criticism of him,
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.100]   but you can't call for the overthrow of the government,
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.700]   nor in Venezuela, nor in the United States for that matter.
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.020]   If you call for the overthrow of the government
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.540]   of the United States, you're gonna be in deep trouble.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.860]   - Well, all right, so to push back on that,
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.620]   it's interesting, it's so interesting
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.540]   because we mentioned Elon Musk,
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.460]   and there's a way that people sound when they speak freely.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.580]   When I speak to, I have family in Ukraine,
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.020]   I have family in Russia.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.820]   When I speak to people in Russia,
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.860]   let's put my family aside, when I speak to people in Russia,
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.220]   I think there's fear.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:23.460]   I think they don't,
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:28.380]   sometimes when you call for the overthrow of government,
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.860]   that's important, not because you necessarily believe
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:32.720]   for the overthrow of the government,
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.820]   but you just need to test, test the power centers
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:41.060]   and make sure they're responsive to the people.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.660]   And I feel like there's a mix of fear and apathy.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:50.220]   That has a different texture than it does
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.460]   in the United States.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:58.620]   That worries me because I would like to see
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.540]   the flourishing of a people in all places.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.460]   - Well, as I said, my impression was that there's far more
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.980]   freedom in the press than was pictured by the West.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.860]   And that means different points of view
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.660]   'cause the Russians are always arguing with themselves.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.660]   I've never seen a country that's so contentious.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.620]   (laughing)
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.700]   There's more intellectuals in Moscow and the cities
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.620]   than you can believe.
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.420]   And you know the Russian people there.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.600]   They've been fighting government for years,
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.660]   back from the 1870s, czarist times.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.260]   They're always plotting against the government.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.900]   And the intelligentsia is known through history
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:37.140]   as being contentious and anti-government in many ways.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.180]   And we see the same thing,
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:40.860]   educated people turning against Russia.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:41.980]   I don't appreciate those people
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.900]   because I think they're very spoiled
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.280]   and they don't understand some of the stuff
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.620]   that's going on in the West.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:51.100]   But we have a lot of Russians in Europe and America
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:55.060]   that attack Russia and sometimes don't understand
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.220]   that they are under pressure from the United States
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.940]   and they don't understand the size of the pressure.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:02.480]   And that's why Putin connects with the people
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.480]   because he represents more the common man
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.620]   who's saying to you, your interests are threatened.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.980]   Russia is threatened.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.740]   We are representing only the interests of Russia.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.220]   We're not an empire, we're not gonna expand.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.980]   He has no empire intentions,
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.940]   although the West pangs it as empire.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:24.180]   I see no evidence of it.
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:26.020]   Why didn't he do something in all these years?
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.140]   Nothing, he did nothing except defend the country
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:30.940]   in Georgia and in Chechnya.
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.500]   - So the imperialist imperative
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.340]   is coming more from the West.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.420]   - The imperialist, it's the imperialist agenda.
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:40.580]   Going back to, I'm sorry, where we left our discussion off,
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.780]   I mean, I was gonna go on with America
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.020]   not only being censored, has closed down now,
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.060]   closed down, and you say it's not fear.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.140]   Well, it is fear.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.580]   I am scared because if you get your Facebook page suspended
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.220]   or your Twitter account thrown off,
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.060]   a lot of good people are getting their thrown off.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.500]   You can't speak out, it affects your business.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.700]   It goes back to the 1950s, my father's world,
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:12.660]   when you could not express any sympathy for a Soviet Union
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.260]   without endangering your job,
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.420]   without basically being not trusted.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:20.740]   You had to be part of the program to get along, to go along.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.700]   Same thing when United Kingdom,
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.340]   I mean, for all their talk, this Boris Johnson is an idiot,
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:27.820]   but all their talk about,
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.620]   do you remember their policies with the IRA in Ireland
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.320]   when Ireland was threatening them?
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.180]   They cut off the IRA completely.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:37.860]   Jerry Adams, who was a wonderful guy, I met him,
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.300]   was not allowed to even be heard in Britain
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.220]   during certain years.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.620]   In France, all constantly through the Algerian War,
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.660]   the Algerians were not allowed to be heard.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:51.060]   The Algerian War for Independence divided France greatly.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.820]   You could not even show "Paths of Glory,"
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.100]   a World War I film in France for, I don't know,
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.900]   20 years after it came out.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.380]   Censorship is a way of life
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.940]   when democracies also feel threatened.
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.300]   They are much more fragile than they pretend to be.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.500]   A healthy democracy would take all the criticism
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.260]   in the world and shrug it off and say,
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.300]   "Okay, that's what's good about our country.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.380]   "Well, I'd like to see that in America."
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.300]   There are times that it's been like that,
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.900]   but it's so scary now.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.060]   So it is scary, that's what I was trying to say.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.980]   It's not unscary to me.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.780]   In China, I would say to you,
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.300]   yes, it's much scarier to me
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.280]   because there is the internet wall that they cut off,
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.660]   and I got into problems in China too
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.700]   because I said something years ago
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.100]   about you have to discover your own history.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.500]   You have to be honest about Mao.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.060]   You have to go back and let's make a movie about Mao.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.740]   That upset them and show his negatives.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:49.340]   So China has been much more sensitive than Russia
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.460]   about criticism, much more,
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.360]   and it is a source of problems,
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.700]   but on the other hand, China has a lot of grievances,
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.700]   a lot of going back to the 19th century
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.020]   and the British imperialism of that era
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:02.620]   and the American imperialism.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:07.620]   - If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:11.580]   what kind of things would you talk about here?
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.480]   What kind of questions would you ask?
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:19.260]   - Well, one thing I would certainly ask
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.900]   is what you were thinking on February 23,
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.300]   and I would ask him to reply to my question
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.580]   about what if you took this to phase two?
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.860]   You surrendered in Donbass.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.540]   You had no ego about it.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.380]   You just surrendered.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:33.100]   It's in your interest to your country,
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.740]   and you invited all the refugees from Donbass into Russia
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.980]   as much as they can.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.460]   What would you do now?
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.780]   What's the US next move in your opinion?
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.460]   How are you gonna, okay, where are we gonna go?
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.920]   That would be the key question because it's,
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.020]   but he didn't go that way.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:56.020]   He chose to take the sanctions and to go this way.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.540]   Why he did that is a key question for our time,
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.260]   perhaps it was a mistake, perhaps it was his judgment,
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.340]   perhaps, as I said, but I don't,
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.300]   knowing the man I did, I don't think so.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.420]   I think it was calculated.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.380]   - Now, this is projection and speculation,
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.620]   but there is something different about him
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.800]   in the past several months.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.980]   It could be the COVID thing,
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.180]   the isolation that you mentioned.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:23.940]   I listened to a lot of interviews and speeches in Russian,
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:28.120]   and there's something about power over time
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.620]   that can change you, that can isolate you.
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.060]   - Well, when I was there, no, he'd been in office
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.820]   for already 15 years.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.140]   He had power.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.700]   He didn't misuse it in my opinion.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.520]   He was very even.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.220]   I saw him go on television and talk to his fellows
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.180]   the same way he always talked to them.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:45.220]   He grew with it.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.700]   He grew in intelligence, in knowledge
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.900]   because he had dealings with the whole world now.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.260]   People had come to him.
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:55.620]   He was very well known in Africa and Middle East,
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.280]   certainly Syria.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.820]   And I just never saw misuse of his power.
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.940]   I saw humility in him actually.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.180]   - So perhaps there was a calculation
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:10.460]   and he calculated wrong in terms of what happens
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.620]   if he doesn't invade.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.060]   Perhaps there was a calculation.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.860]   Perhaps he had a calm and clear mind,
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.340]   and he calculated wrong.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.340]   - Well, he also made the point that he,
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.780]   the talk of Zelensky saying nuclear weapons
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.140]   were gonna come into Ukraine.
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:28.240]   There was talk about that right before the invasion too.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.960]   And certainly that would have set off alarms.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.000]   You know, the United States is already kind of doing that
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.460]   by not only putting its intelligence
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:39.680]   and its heavy weaponry into Ukraine,
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.300]   but you've got to deal with the question,
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:42.480]   the next question that comes up,
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.600]   the most immediate question is,
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.680]   is the United States gonna start,
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.640]   and I'm saying this is good.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.760]   They're making a lot of noise,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.820]   the United States press about Russia using nuclear weapons
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.360]   and chemical weapons.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.480]   That's a lot of noise.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.560]   Again, going back to my analogy,
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.120]   when the United States starts that,
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.280]   it starts the conversation going.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.280]   It's in the interest of the United States
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.960]   for Russia to be pinned with any kind of
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.560]   chemical or nuclear incident.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.560]   For example, it'd be very, not simple,
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.400]   but it would be possible to explode a nuclear device
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.600]   in Donbass and kill thousands of people.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.740]   And we would not know right away who did it,
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.380]   but of course the blame would go right to Russia.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.480]   Right to Russia, even if it didn't make sense,
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.320]   if there was no motivation for it.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.340]   It would just be blamed on Russia.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.160]   The United States might well be the one
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.540]   who does that false flag operation.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.580]   It would not be beyond them.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:48.260]   It would be a very dramatic solution
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.700]   to sealing this war off as a major victory
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.540]   for the United States.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.700]   - That's terrifying.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:53.760]   - No, but it can happen.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.600]   It can happen.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.300]   One kiloton device, low yield.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.220]   It's possible.
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.860]   - So when you walk across that line,
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.020]   you can potentially never walk back.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.540]   - Well, I think the United States is calculating
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.500]   that it's a dangerous, yes, I agree.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.460]   But I think the neoconservative arrogance is such
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:16.300]   that they really believe they can push their advantage
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.020]   to the max now.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.500]   That because of all these propaganda successes up to now,
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.780]   the Ukrainian army could be wiped out for all we know.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.980]   There's all that's left is their neo-Nazi brigades.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.580]   But they're being advised very well by the US.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:30.900]   And they're sending the weapons in,
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.940]   are huge amounts of weapons.
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:33.020]   What about American budget?
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:36.860]   No one talks about how much money we're giving to Ukraine.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.200]   It's a billion dollars already in weaponry.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.780]   And not most of it just poured in.
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:45.920]   What about, you know, the Russian budget is,
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:51.060]   defense budget is 60 some billion dollars a year.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:54.820]   It's nothing compared to the United States, 1/15 of it.
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:59.020]   But yet we've put so much weaponry into Ukraine.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.100]   The money we've spent on Ukraine is equivalent almost
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:07.100]   to what we spent on COVID in our own country.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:10.740]   It's astounding the distortion of our priorities.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.900]   There's also chemical.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.860]   Don't forget chemical is probably the easier way to go.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:20.540]   But in Syria, there was far too many incidents of America
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:25.540]   in its quest to demonize Assad and the Russians
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:28.020]   of all these chemical attacks that were happening
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:31.220]   that they were vowing came from Russia.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:36.220]   And in spite of the fact that Russia just pulled out of the,
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:38.500]   signed the agreement on chemical arms
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.580]   and apparently destroyed its stock several years ago.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:47.700]   It's strange that the strangest incidents happened in Syria.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.340]   You go back to 'em, trace every one.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.900]   Good journalism was done.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:53.620]   The White Helmets got a lot of fame,
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.040]   but they were corrupted.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.060]   And many good journalists tried to point out
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:01.460]   the inconsistencies in the American accusations.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:07.100]   Robert Perry among them, who was one of my mentors
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.600]   at Consortium Press.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.100]   A lot of good, you'd have to go back,
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.380]   but trace each, like you would trace each time
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:16.020]   they made an accusation against Putin of murder.
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:19.660]   You need that same kind of Sherlock Holmes intensity.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.900]   Investigation.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.060]   And they don't do it because the United Nations
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.940]   or the chemical, not the United Nations as much
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:29.540]   as the chemical people, the organization
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.740]   has been tampered with.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:33.220]   If you remember correctly, there was accusations
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:36.780]   that the chemical investigative unit,
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:39.980]   I don't know the name of it, was tampered with.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.340]   And people quit.
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.220]   People who were working on that commission quit
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.380]   and said that this is not legit.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.780]   So very interesting, that Syria story is wacko.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.700]   So the United States is willing to use chemical
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.300]   in Syria freely.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.340]   It did it three, four times.
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.420]   If you remember correctly, Trump was challenged
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:59.980]   that he did not attack after a chemical incident in Syria.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.460]   All these newscasters in the United States,
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.700]   the most heaviest of them were saying,
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:08.860]   well, President Trump is now finally acting
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.180]   like a real president when he attacks,
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.900]   when he drops missiles in Syria.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.300]   They actually said that.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.140]   In other words, they wanted Trump to go to war on Syria,
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:17.980]   but he didn't.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.180]   - Chemical weapons.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.020]   - Chemical and nuclear.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:23.260]   - Nuclear is really terrifying.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:28.260]   Do you think, now combine this with the fascinating choice
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.260]   in your interviews with Vladimir Putin
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.340]   to watch Stanley Kubrick's--
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.660]   - Doctor Strange.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.980]   - Doctor Strange Love, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:38.860]   and Love the Bomb.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.180]   And given the fact that you did that,
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:46.380]   now looking at the fact that the word nuclear,
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.820]   and it feels like the world hangs
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.820]   on the brink of nuclear war,
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:55.740]   do you think that that's overstating the case?
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:56.780]   - No.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.300]   That's what worried me from the beginning,
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.580]   and that's probably why I got involved in all this stuff,
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:05.100]   because I go back to the '60s when I was,
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:07.420]   when we were so close to nuclear war.
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:08.700]   I lived through that period,
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.220]   and I thought, as many people did,
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.900]   that this was, it was gonna come now.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.620]   So I've lived through that,
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.700]   and I didn't sense the period in '83
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.540]   when Reagan took us to the edge,
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.300]   if you remember correctly, Able Archer was an exercise
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.660]   that almost brought us to,
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.220]   'cause the Russians were really paranoid at that point,
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.860]   and they were responding to our military exercise
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.700]   on Able Archer.
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.580]   There was also the Korean airliner, they went down.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.500]   There were numerous incidents in the '80s,
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.240]   but I never felt the fear.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.300]   I thought Reagan was testing the limits,
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:46.260]   but perhaps if I'd been younger, I would've felt it.
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:48.340]   But anyway, no, we come close.
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.380]   The United States has risked this several times.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.540]   If I told you, it would be hard for you to believe.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:57.980]   If I could set a scene for you in a drama in 1962
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:01.180]   when Kennedy has a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:06.180]   and the CIA, and they talk about a plan,
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.220]   a military plan to first strike the Soviet Union and China.
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.500]   Okay, it was an Eisenhower plan
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.540]   that had been put into potential operation
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:26.140]   in early '60s or '50s, late '50s, SIOP '62.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:29.820]   This was an attack on the Soviet Union's first strike.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:32.220]   That's why the United States has never given up
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.740]   the concept of first strike.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:38.540]   It's interesting that the Russian nuclear policy posture
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:41.860]   is more defensive than the American one,
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.540]   which leaves options open.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:49.340]   The same options that are open in neoconservative agreements
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:52.500]   that we see from the late '90s where they say,
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.180]   the emergence of a rival power will not be tolerated.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:58.300]   That's a very broad statement,
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.820]   and it allows you to do a lot, including nuclear.
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.660]   So you have to understand the United States is always,
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.940]   first of all, it breaks so many treaties.
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:10.220]   We know that from the Putin story
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.940]   about the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002,
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:17.260]   and then the INF treaty of, they broke that one.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.980]   That was the intermediate missile.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:21.380]   That was 2019.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.940]   I don't know when they broke it off,
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:25.060]   but the United States has not been very faithful
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.340]   on its nuclear agreements.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:30.540]   And so I don't know that we can even deal
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.140]   with the United States diplomatically.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.220]   It seems to be impossible.
[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:35.780]   Now, brings me to Biden.
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:38.860]   - Yes, another Irishman.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.260]   - This is the opposite of Kennedy.
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:43.860]   Kennedy was a Catholic Irish anti-imperialist.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:45.340]   Biden seems to be the opposite.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:48.340]   He seems to be a get-along, go-along guy
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.820]   who's been not only old,
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:52.780]   but he's also gone along with this program,
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:56.180]   which I voted for Biden because I feared Trump,
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:59.060]   but I thought Biden at a certain age would mellow.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.300]   I really did.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:01.700]   He's not mellowed, apparently.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.060]   He's still listening to these people, and he believes them.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:08.340]   And it seems that his, that horrible woman,
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.580]   Victoria Nuland, who was Undersecretary of State,
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.620]   he appointed her to this sector of the world.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.060]   She's very influential,
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:19.000]   and she's been one of the worst people on Ukraine.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.220]   She obviously was behind the coup.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.740]   She was the one who boasted that, you know,
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:28.820]   we got our man in, Yats, whatever, Yatsinuk,
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:32.820]   and also, remember the famous statement, "Fuck the EU."
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.440]   All these things, but she's back,
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.380]   and she said the other day about,
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:40.380]   if the Soviets, if the Russians use nuclear weaponry
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.540]   of any kind, there's gonna be a horrible price to pay.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.900]   That was, she was out of the blue.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.720]   I said, "What the hell is she doing?"
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.740]   She's talking nuclear all of a sudden.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:52.780]   And then since that day, everybody in the US press,
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:54.180]   all the shows have gone,
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.620]   talked nuclear, nuclear, nuclear.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:33:00.060]   Secretary of State has done it, Blinken.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:05.620]   It scares you.
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.300]   If you think about it, the United States scares me.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:11.320]   - So that's the military industrial complex machine,
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.140]   fully functional, fully operational behind this whole thing.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:14.980]   - It certainly is.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.220]   - Is that what's to blame?
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.460]   - It certainly is.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.900]   That's why I showed him "Strange Love,"
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:20.700]   because I wanted him to show him,
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.820]   I wanted Mr. Putin to say, "Look at this film.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:23.660]   "You never saw it.
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.860]   "How can you not say you never?"
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:27.740]   It's a seminal film in American history
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:28.940]   to those people who care,
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:33.940]   and it shows you the, Kubrick had a pacifist, thank God,
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:39.100]   anti-war mentality, which he showed in "Paths of Glory,"
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.900]   as well as "Strange Love."
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:46.180]   And it's such a dire, well-done scenario
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.700]   that I wanted Mr. Putin to be aware
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.500]   of the way the United States thinks.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.940]   - Yeah, the absurdity of escalation,
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.500]   the absurdity of war at the largest scale,
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.460]   the absurdity of nuclear war especially.
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:02.040]   Can we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:05.220]   - Can we? - Can we?
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.140]   - Yes, yes, we can. - What's the path
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.140]   to walk back? - Reason.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.380]   (laughing)
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.380]   - Reason and diplomacy. - Between who and whom.
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.180]   - There's no reason, I mean, talk to the guy.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:17.860]   Mr. Biden, why don't you calm down
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.860]   and go and talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow?
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.020]   Why don't you just sit across the table
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.300]   and try to have a discussion
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:28.440]   without falling into ideologies and stuff like that?
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.160]   - Can I ask you for advice?
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.720]   You did some of the most difficult interviews ever.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:38.460]   Do you have advice that you can give to someone like me
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.540]   or anyone hoping to understand something
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:44.780]   about a human being sitting across from them
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.880]   about what it takes to do a good interview?
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.280]   - You're doing one.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.340]   (laughing)
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:52.720]   - Well, no, but there's a, listen,
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.080]   there's levels to this game.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.080]   And interviewing somebody like Vladimir Putin,
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.980]   also language barrier.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.900]   Sit across from the man, try to keep an open mind,
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.820]   try to also ask challenging questions,
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:11.020]   but not challenging with an agenda,
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:14.340]   but seeking to understand and understand deeply.
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:15.940]   How do you do that?
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.220]   - Seeking the truth.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.040]   It's very simple, seeking the truth.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.980]   Being a questioner like you are,
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:23.380]   you wanna know what is really going on.
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.980]   I could not get anywhere with Biden or Bush
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.100]   or for that matter, Obama, they'd be opaque with me.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.380]   There's no interview possible
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.660]   with the President of the United States
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.920]   because he's gotta stand for all the stuff
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.660]   that they stand for, which is imperialism,
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:39.180]   which is control of the world.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.380]   How can you defend that?
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.580]   No one's gonna come out and say that.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:44.740]   They're always gonna blame the enemy.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.920]   They're gonna blame Iran, they're gonna blame China.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.060]   - So some people, it may not be possible
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.340]   to break through the opaqueness.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:52.160]   - You can't, you can't.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.260]   I mean, have you ever seen an interview with the President
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.940]   besides being personable
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.200]   where he actually discussed American policy?
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.600]   - Yeah, I mean, not really, but maybe after their President.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.880]   I could see Obama being able to do such an interview.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.200]   I could see George W. being able to do such an interview.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.360]   Or are they not able to reflect at all on the--
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.200]   - George W. hasn't shown much conscience
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.680]   in thinking about what he's done.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.640]   You've seen that.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.520]   You ever see my movie, W?
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.240]   I think that's one of my best movies
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.400]   because it shows a man who's just out of his depth
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.320]   and has no, he has a conscience at the end of the movie,
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.080]   if you remember correctly, he talks to his wife
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.140]   and he says, "I don't get it.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.380]   "I'm trying to do good in the world.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.780]   "I've done, I believe in good and right,
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.280]   "and why do people not understand that?"
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.920]   You know, that kind of complaint
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.660]   as if he can't get outside himself
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.060]   to understand the way other people think.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.800]   Empathy, walking like a dramatist is what I do.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.720]   You walk in the footsteps of other people.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.440]   When I did a movie about Richard Nixon,
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.080]   it wasn't because I liked him.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.840]   It was because I wanted to,
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.960]   I think I understood a part of him because of my father
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.680]   and I think I wanted to walk in his footsteps.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.160]   That's not to say I sympathize with him because I didn't.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.920]   I don't think he helped the American cause at all,
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.920]   but it was empathize as opposed to sympathize.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.080]   Same thing with Bush.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.720]   People were shocked when I did the Bush movie.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.860]   They said, "How can you be in any way,
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:18.360]   "any way receptive to this guy?"
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.720]   That's wrong.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.120]   Dramatists don't have political positions.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.960]   They walk in the shoes of.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:27.200]   That's why Bush movie perhaps was surprising
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.400]   and many people didn't care for it.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.360]   Maybe that's what,
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:34.520]   but that's, you've got to go there.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.120]   No, if you did a movie about a villain, you have to go there.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.040]   - You have to walk in their shoes.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.880]   - Yes.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.680]   - So see them, 'cause they usually,
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.640]   villains usually see themselves as the hero.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.600]   - Yes.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.040]   - So you have to consider what is it like
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.920]   to live in a world where this person is the hero?
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.760]   - Yes.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.000]   - Is that a burden?
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:57.840]   Is that hard?
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.960]   - Not for George W. Bush.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.640]   He's bitching because they didn't understand him,
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:05.200]   but he had a good vision, he said, of democracy.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.760]   And you know, democracy forgives a lot of sins.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.800]   - Can I ask you a hard question on that?
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.320]   - Yes, sure.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.920]   - So because empathy is so important to a great interview,
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.440]   let's ask the most challenging version of empathy,
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.440]   which is when you're sitting across
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.080]   from a man on the brink of war
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.640]   that leads to tens of millions of deaths, which is Hitler.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:31.300]   So if you could interview Hitler in 1939,
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:35.200]   as the drums of war start to beat,
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.160]   or 1941, when they're already full on war,
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.920]   but there's still a lot of pacifists,
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.120]   there's still a lot of people unsure
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.360]   what are the motivations behind what Hitler's doing.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.640]   How would you do that interview?
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.760]   - Well, it depends when you do it.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.480]   If you do it in '38, I certainly would have,
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.120]   no, you have to, if you sit down across from Hitler,
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:57.960]   you empathize.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.080]   What is your beef?
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.680]   Where have you been?
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.200]   What is your consciousness?
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.200]   Why do you hate Jewish people?
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:10.200]   Why, what is, you know, all these questions that come up.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.840]   His sense of grievance as a result of World War I.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.360]   There's justifications there, et cetera.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.280]   But if I, and by the way,
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.120]   Churchill was trying to make a deal with them in '38.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.040]   That's a fact that people don't know.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.600]   Churchill himself, and you know,
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.200]   there was still the desire in England
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.160]   to make peace with Germany.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:32.040]   And it was seen as a possible,
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.440]   what Churchill really wanted was Hitler
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.880]   to go against Russia.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.080]   And he, anything to destroy the Bolsheviks.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.760]   So he was using Hitler as much as he could
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.320]   to go after Russia.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.640]   But Hitler was too elusive to get, to pin him down.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.680]   But if you remember, Hitler was very kind at the end of,
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.040]   kind is not the right word,
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:57.200]   was, did not go after the British Empire
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.560]   when he had France, and he could have.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.320]   He had another objective, which was obviously the East.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.560]   So Hitler's goal, I think,
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.480]   he always had an admiration for England.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.740]   It's an interesting story, always.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.320]   - And the Empire.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.160]   - Yes.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.960]   And certainly Churchill,
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.800]   we have no doubts now from history revisionism
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.520]   that Churchill's interest, main interest, was not Germany.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.800]   It was the British Empire.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:26.640]   - Yes.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.560]   - And to preserve it to India,
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.200]   the road to India and all that, and Middle East.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.640]   Churchill fought the entire war
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.140]   with the concept of preserving the British Empire.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:39.880]   All his goals, he sent America on a goose chase into Italy.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.800]   You could argue instead of establishing
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.440]   a sincere second front in Western Europe.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.080]   Interesting man.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.440]   So I would have tried to get,
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.600]   I think I would approach it the same way.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.060]   In 1939, it would have been a different story
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:41:00.060]   because at that point, he'd attacked Poland in 1940 France.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.400]   So it's another ballgame.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.280]   But certainly, at whatever point you talk to him,
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.080]   I would try to understand his point.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.160]   So I'm not judging you, Hitler.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.320]   I'm saying to you, tell me what you're thinking.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.520]   Why are you invading Russia?
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.760]   What's your thought?
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.120]   That's all an interviewer should do.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:18.040]   He shouldn't be expressing his contempt for Hitler,
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.400]   which is like an American journalist interviewing Putin.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.880]   I'm getting brownie points for expressing my contempt
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.720]   for you?
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.840]   That doesn't wash with me.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.880]   That's ugly.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.240]   - Yeah, seek to understand.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.080]   - Yes.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.720]   - This is a technical question,
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.840]   but was language a barrier as an interviewer?
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.760]   - To some degree.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.120]   It's very hard to learn Russian.
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.080]   But they have excellent translators in the Kremlin.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:43.920]   Excellent.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.520]   They are people who are trained very seriously
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:50.440]   for months or years before they...
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.680]   These people are young and they're very bright.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.520]   I was very impressed with the Russian translator.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.360]   - It's interesting.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.220]   I mean, I'm impressed as well,
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.520]   but there's a humor that's lost.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.640]   There's a wit, a dry wit.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.760]   There's stuff said between the lines
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.360]   that's not actually have much content,
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.680]   but it's more kind of the things
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.240]   that make communication more frictionless.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:20.880]   There's a kind of sadness to a Russian humor
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.680]   that permeates all things,
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.800]   and that sometimes is lost in translation.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.920]   The translation is a little bit colder,
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.800]   meaning it just conveys the facts.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.680]   - Would you call it sardonic humor?
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.400]   - I would say so, yeah.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.280]   And so it's interesting.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.400]   But I think you could see that from facial expressions
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.120]   when you're sitting across from the person
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.280]   and you can feel it. - I feel it, yeah.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.920]   - Let me ask you in general,
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.480]   what's the role of love in the human condition
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.720]   in your life, in life in general?
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.680]   You've talked, you looked at some of the darkest aspect
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.580]   of human nature.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.200]   What's the role of this,
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:59.560]   one of the more beautiful aspects of human nature?
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:01.080]   - I think without love, I wouldn't,
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.960]   I don't think I'd be able to carry on.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.240]   I think that love is my,
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.960]   love is the greatest,
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:11.160]   the ability to love is the greatest virtue you can have.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.000]   It's the ability to share with another,
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.720]   with your family, with your children, with your wife,
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.480]   with your lover, your partner.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.400]   It's an ability to extend yourself into the world,
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.920]   and it brings empathy with it.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.840]   If you love well, I think you expand it
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:28.400]   to the human race too.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.440]   And it's the strength behind the great novelists,
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.580]   the great artists of our time.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:36.360]   I think,
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:42.300]   part of the reason I suppose we're scared of science
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.340]   sometimes is because the scientists sometimes
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.660]   don't express that clearly.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:50.340]   - You can lose that when you focus on the facts,
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:54.500]   on empirical data, on the science of things.
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:58.380]   You can lose the humanity that's between the lines.
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:00.740]   - I'm often struck by when I talk to scientists,
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.080]   and I've talked to a few,
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.980]   that how arrogant they can be about,
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:06.980]   they don't talk to you if you don't understand their world,
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:08.140]   and they talk to each other,
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.660]   and there's an arrogance, a closed circle kind of thing.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.580]   Oh, he's not at my level, I can't,
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.620]   there's no discussion to be had with this person,
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:16.220]   he's a human being.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.100]   - That arrogance is terrifying to me
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:23.060]   because it's next door neighbor to closed mindedness,
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.460]   which then can be used by charismatic leaders
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:27.460]   as it was in Nazi Germany
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.780]   to commit some of the worst atrocities.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:34.100]   The scientists can be used as pawns
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.820]   in a very cruel game.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:39.600]   What advice would you give to young people?
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.740]   You've done, first of all, some of the greatest films ever.
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:47.980]   You've lived a heck of a life.
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:51.720]   You were fearless and bold in asking
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.020]   some really difficult questions of this world.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.300]   What advice would you give to young people today,
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:59.800]   high school, college, about career?
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.820]   How to have a career they can be proud of,
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:04.980]   or how to have a life they can be proud of?
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:07.860]   - Well, I have three children,
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.580]   so obviously I'm not necessarily
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:13.340]   the best advisor in the world.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.700]   And I do find that the children,
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.500]   I've raised them with a sense of freedom,
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.340]   and they do what they want.
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:22.840]   In the end, it's their life, their destiny, their character.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.540]   That's what comes out.
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:27.060]   You can try to influence it,
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:30.420]   but you can try to get your daughter to wake up
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:32.860]   at a certain hour in the day, but it never works.
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:37.340]   So I long ago gave up on that.
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:40.240]   And my children are all grown now.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:43.840]   But aside from that, I think if I was a teacher
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.820]   in a school and teaching film,
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.980]   I'd say to the students, get an education.
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:51.680]   You can't just look at film,
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.940]   because it's not a full education, it's not the spectrum.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.980]   I don't think you should teach film as a,
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:02.780]   I think you need a base in other worlds.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:05.860]   One of the greatest courses I took at NYU was,
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.580]   and I was a war veteran on the GI Bill,
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.900]   so I was older than the other students.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:15.580]   I took a class outside the film school in Greek classics,
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:18.220]   because I hadn't had much history,
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.700]   and I wanted to know more about the world of Homer
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:21.540]   and so forth.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:25.700]   And the teacher opened my eyes to so much in that class,
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.940]   and I wrote about it in my memoir,
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:29.620]   it's called "Chasing the Light,"
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:32.620]   about Professor Leahy and what he did to me.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:36.620]   He gave me the concepts clearly of consciousness,
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:39.660]   which is the Homeric theme of Odysseus.
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:46.900]   And also, lethe, L-E-T-H-E, which is sleep,
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:51.540]   and how most of the crew,
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:54.740]   Odysseus' crew were experiencing lethe,
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:57.500]   and how necessary it was to stay awake.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.900]   So it's not just film, it's just you have to learn
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.500]   the world as much as you can when you're young.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:09.500]   And so that, I think, is the basis of a good education,
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:12.080]   and a classic one is important.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:15.460]   A basis.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.140]   I think then you go on and you can learn computer,
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.300]   if you want to.
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.900]   But that's specialization, you know.
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.600]   If you're a computer geek, is that a life?
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.380]   Does that give you enough satisfaction?
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:29.860]   Do you get the joy out of people?
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.100]   - No, just like filmmaking is a skill.
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:32.940]   - Yes, right.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.580]   - You need to have the broad background
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.660]   to understand the world.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:37.580]   Literature.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.020]   - Yes.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:40.340]   - History.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.180]   - Absolutely.
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:46.140]   - So one of the things about being human
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:48.540]   is life is finite.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.020]   It ends.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.180]   Do you think about your death?
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:53.380]   Are you afraid of your death?
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:54.340]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:56.660]   Absolutely, you have to come to terms with death.
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.660]   And that's a tough one for many people.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:47:59.500]   It's always there.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.340]   I'm older than you, obviously,
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:02.940]   and I'm getting closer to it.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.820]   Couldn't happen any day, actually.
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.260]   When you get to a certain age,
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:08.500]   you can't assume that you're gonna be alive tomorrow.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.380]   So I try to deal with that.
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.340]   - Are you afraid of it?
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.540]   - Much less so than I was when I was younger.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.780]   Remember, I was in Vietnam,
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:18.340]   but I thought I dealt with it there.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:21.820]   But when I came back, I realized that I wanted to live.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:24.620]   So yes, I've learned over time
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:27.980]   to get more and more used to it and get ready for it.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:31.020]   - What's a good answer to the question of why live?
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.500]   So the realization that you wanted to live.
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:36.620]   What was the reason to live?
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.760]   - Because it was better than being one of those corpses
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.760]   that I saw in the jungle.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.320]   You know, I saw how finite death is.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.140]   - Are there things in your life you regret?
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:48.980]   - Oh, sure.
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:50.180]   (Lex laughing)
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:51.020]   Too many.
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:56.740]   - Is there something you wish
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:58.060]   you could have done differently?
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.620]   Like if you could go back to do one thing differently?
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:01.860]   Or that regrets always?
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:04.100]   - You should ask Musk this, I'm curious.
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:04.940]   What'd he say?
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.260]   - Offline all the time.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:11.520]   - No, no.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.680]   - You'd be curious to know.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:13.960]   - He's an engineer too,
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.360]   and engineers really value mistakes.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.200]   - Engineers value--
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.600]   - They value mistakes and errors
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.400]   because that's an opportunity to learn.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.120]   I mean, this is what you do with systems
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.520]   is you test them, then test them, then test them.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.560]   And errors is just information.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.400]   He did that with the rockets.
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.240]   - Well, the same thing is true in its way of filmmaking.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.240]   There are certain things you learn as you build films
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.720]   and you make mistakes.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.240]   It's like putting an engine together
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:42.300]   and you, oh, the film is flawed in that way, you know it.
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.900]   Other people may or may not see it,
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:48.300]   but the car runs or it made money or it didn't make money.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:49.940]   It can be good and it didn't make money,
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:53.180]   but it didn't, the point is that everything is a build.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.820]   Every film is a construction.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:57.580]   Same thing as he goes through on a Tesla,
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.900]   we go through on each film.
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:03.140]   - But films are art.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:03.980]   It's a little--
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:05.780]   - Yeah, the thing is one film does not lead
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:09.840]   to a lifetime guarantee of copyright.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:16.600]   - Well, yeah, you have the movie game as you've called it.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.020]   - Yeah.
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:22.680]   - Is a complicated and cruel game.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.960]   - But it takes enormous amount of work,
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.560]   enormous amount of work to make a film.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.840]   People underestimate that.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:33.600]   It's extremely complicated to have something be successful
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.180]   because it has so many elements of luck involved
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:41.900]   and reception and so forth.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:46.300]   - What do you think, I apologize for the absurd question,
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:48.540]   but what do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.260]   Why are we here?
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:51.100]   The why.
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:52.060]   - I think to realize ourselves,
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:54.700]   to realize more of what you are,
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.700]   to realize what life is, to appreciate it,
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:02.580]   to grow, to honor our life, to honor the concept of life
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:04.620]   and to understand how precious life is,
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:08.900]   the preciousness of life as the Buddhists say,
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:12.380]   and of course the immediacy of death all around us.
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.740]   The causes of death are all around us
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:18.600]   and our life is like, as they say,
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.600]   is like a lantern in a strong breeze existing
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.620]   among the causes of death.
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:29.060]   So life is so precious and at the same time,
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:32.660]   immediacy of death and then of course the continuation
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:35.020]   of life in whatever form it's gonna take.
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:40.180]   - But in this life, to wake up to the preciousness of it,
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:41.020]   to the preciousness--
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:42.140]   - Yeah, that's a wonderful thing.
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:43.780]   By the way, I didn't have that when I was young.
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:44.880]   I took it for granted.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:49.860]   - Oliver, like I said, I'm a huge fan.
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:51.780]   You're an incredible human being,
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:53.880]   one of the greatest artists ever.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:57.300]   So it's a huge honor that you sit with me
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.700]   and talk so deeply and honestly
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:02.500]   about some very difficult topics.
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:05.180]   Again, you're an inspiration and it's an honor
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.860]   that you will spend your valuable time with me.
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.700]   - Thank you very much.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:08.520]   - Thanks for talking to me.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.980]   - Fun being here.
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.460]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.660]   with Oliver Stone.

[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.560]   from Oliver Stone in the untold history
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.540]   of the United States.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:24.700]   To fail is not tragic.
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:26.420]   To be human is.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:30.220]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.800]   (upbeat music)
