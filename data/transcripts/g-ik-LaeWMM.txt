[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - You talked about this serendipity of meeting people,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.720]   locals, kind of immersing yourself in these experiences
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.640]   that you probably couldn't have pretended.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.120]   Do you think there's a way,
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.180]   not necessarily to like cheat the system,
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.640]   but to kind of engineer that serendipity
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.680]   to kind of give it a greater chance of happening
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.900]   than you would if you maybe had a whole week with no agenda?
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.000]   You know, maybe you just go sit at bars, talk to strangers,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.960]   but what if you have a day
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.880]   and you really wanna try to make something local
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.960]   and interesting and magical happen,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.040]   what would be your advice to someone trying to do that?
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.460]   - I mean, the first one I think is obvious
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.560]   to anyone who's traveled before,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.360]   but it's put the phone away again.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   Like, you know, I think,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.000]   especially when you're traveling alone, I do it too.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.680]   It's the best social crutch there is, right?
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.560]   If you're sitting alone and you feel nervous about it
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.920]   or you're bored or whatever else,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.040]   you immediately pull out your phone,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.000]   but that signals to everyone else that you're busy
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.940]   or you're closed off.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.640]   The amount of conversations that I've started
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.920]   from just sitting somewhere and just looking around,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.440]   like people used to do when they had downtime,
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.920]   just kind of staring into space
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.240]   and making eye contact with someone, saying hello.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880]   You know, next thing you know, they say hello.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.720]   How are you?
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   Next thing you know,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.360]   you're getting invited to grandma's house for dinner.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.040]   Like that has happened so many times.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040]   I think people are naturally curious,
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.360]   especially for solo travelers.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.980]   They're curious why you're visiting their home,
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.600]   what you're up to while you're there,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.460]   if you actually have the best recommendations
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.320]   or if you're going on some, you know,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.260]   that's something that they'd consider the tourist path
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.180]   or whatever that you actually,
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.300]   they want to steer you somewhere else.
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.380]   People are very passionate about where they're from.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.620]   So tapping into that.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.200]   I think going in also being like,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.540]   I'm going to be just a little more extroverted
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.460]   than I normally am, goes a long way.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.320]   And I'm not, I'm an extrovert in the sense that I do
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.480]   get energy from being around friends and family
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.940]   and being around people I love.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.840]   But I'm still like a nervous extrovert,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.680]   if that makes sense.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.600]   Like I still get like phone anxiety and like, you know,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   weird, weird nervousness around approaching strangers
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.160]   and all these other things.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.280]   So it takes an effort for me to be like,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.520]   I'm going to strike up a conversation with this,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.760]   with these random people.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.580]   And just as one example, I remember I was in Munich,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.180]   which is a city that if you ask people from Munich,
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.580]   they'll be the first to admit that it's like
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.620]   not an easy place to meet people.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.060]   It's just part of the, I think, Bavarian culture and such.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   It's a little more insular.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.060]   It's a little more, yeah, a little more insular,
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.980]   a little more insidery.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.060]   So I was having trouble, like I was there for work too,
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.620]   and I needed a story and I was having trouble
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.800]   meeting people.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.900]   And I was hanging out at this bar, not looking at my phone.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.920]   So I was more aware of my surroundings.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440]   And I was like overhearing this conversation
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.760]   with a bunch of dudes standing next to me.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.120]   And they were like talking about space and rockets
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   and astrophysics and like all just like
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.760]   very fascinating stuff.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.000]   And like, it took me a second to like work up the courage.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.120]   But once I did, I literally just like poked my head in.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.760]   I was like, "Hey, do you mind if I join you?"
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.360]   And they were like, "Yeah, of course, come on in, whatever."
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.400]   And I brought them around or whatever.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   Next thing I know, I'm talking to these like
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.920]   five astrophysicists who were working on some like
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   German space program in the woods of Munich,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.060]   just like totally fascinating stuff.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.780]   We spend the whole rest of the evening together.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.300]   We go to a show, we just like hang out,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.380]   taking me to like all their favorite beer gardens.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.300]   And all because I just took that plunge.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.280]   And it was like a little weird.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.100]   It's a little awkward to do that in any situation,
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.260]   at least for me it is.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.000]   But like, I took a deep breath and went in there
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.840]   and said, "Hello."
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.060]   And next thing you know, I had this really wonderful,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.860]   pretty magical day in a city where it's hard to do that.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.620]   It's hard to find that serendipity.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.440]   So I think those would be my two biggest
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.680]   overarching tips around that is one,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.740]   being open to it, opening yourself up to it.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.040]   And the first step towards that
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.320]   is literally being physically available.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.640]   So stop staring at your phone,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.080]   put the book down for a second, just be there,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   look around and see what happens.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   And then two, it's like,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.880]   push yourself to just be a little more extroverted
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.920]   than you usually are.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.680]   And then actually, no, I'd add a third one too.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.620]   And this goes back to mindset as well.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.100]   And this has taken me a while to really master,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.640]   if I can even call it that,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   but it's admitting your own ignorance and embracing it.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.900]   I think a lot of the times,
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.820]   especially with well-traveled people,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.400]   there's a tendency to be like,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.020]   to make it competitive almost, right?
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.600]   Be like, "Oh, I know this, and I've been there,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.660]   "and I know my way around this,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.520]   "and I've traveled, so I don't need help,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.360]   "and I can find my way,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.460]   "and I've read about this place that I'm traveling to,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.720]   "so I don't need to know anymore."
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.080]   But people, you're never gonna know
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.360]   as much as someone who lives there,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.580]   who has been born and raised there.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.620]   You're never gonna know as much.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.780]   You could live there for 10, 20 years.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.200]   You're still not gonna know as much as someone.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   I've lived in New York for a decade.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.080]   I'm not a New Yorker.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.280]   I'm never gonna know New York like a New Yorker.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.700]   And admitting that leads to you asking the right questions.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.680]   It leads to the approach that you have
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.560]   when you're talking to people,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.080]   the openness that you bring to new experiences
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.240]   and new culturals and things
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.880]   that might be unfamiliar to you.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.480]   All of that first is gonna just come across
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.160]   so much more effectively if you first admit
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   that you really don't know anything,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.800]   and you're there to learn, and you're there to engage.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   And I think just that mindset opens up a place in a big way,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.240]   and it's very hard to do,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.640]   especially the more traveled you are,
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.480]   'cause you start being like, "Oh, I know my way around.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.360]   "I know how to navigate this stuff."
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.440]   And so still for me, too,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.280]   when I'm at a place that I've been to 100 times,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.560]   I still try to approach it as like,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.480]   there's still something to learn.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.040]   I still am not a local, I'll never be,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.280]   so what can I learn from a local?
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.000]   And having that eagerness and that curiosity
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.880]   is gonna make you approach the right people
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   and ask the right questions,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.500]   and then the rest is serendipity.
