[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   Pastor John, we've received a number of emails that have asked a very similar
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.440]   question asked by moms who are interested to hear your thoughts about
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.680]   their role in raising sons. The first thing I would say to mom is teach the
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.160]   boy, teach your son. If you're married, that is if you're not a single mom, but
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.120]   if you're married, you and he together teach the whole counsel of God to your
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.400]   son. Hear my son your father's instruction and do not forsake your
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   mother's teaching. Proverbs 1 8. My son, keep your father's commandment and
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.880]   forsake not your mother's teaching. Proverbs 6 20. And there's that wonderful
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:56.200]   story, right, of Lois and Eunice in 2nd Timothy where Paul says to this young
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   man, "Continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.080]   whom you learned it." 2nd Timothy 3 14. And who's that? Chapter 1 verse 5, "I am
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.840]   reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that first dwelt in your grandmother,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.680]   Lois, and your mother, Eunice. And now I am sure dwells in you, because we know
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   from Acts that his father wasn't converted. He was a Greek, and he wasn't a
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.000]   Christian. And so it appears that Paul chose as part of his missionary band a
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.640]   young, and I think we would say timid, man who had been almost entirely schooled by
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   his mother and his grandmother. And that, I think, should raise the stakes of a mom,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.120]   a single mom in particular, or a grandmother. Raise the stakes very high
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.080]   as to your mighty influence in shaping the life of a son. The next thing
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.320]   I'd say is expect obedience from your son. Children, obey your parentsâ€”not just
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.120]   your father, but your parents in the Lord. Require that this boy recognize God's
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.600]   authority in you, and punish disobedience, and require and reward
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.840]   obedience. Then I would say model strong womanhood. 1 Peter 3, "As you are her
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.800]   children, Sarah's children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.720]   frightening." The godly woman is the fearless woman. That's what I mean when I
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.480]   say strong womanhood. Or Proverbs 31, "Strength and dignity are her clothing;
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.320]   she laughs at the time to come." So a son should look to a mother not as a weak
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.000]   woman who's always anxious about tomorrow, but this woman should be like a
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.600]   oak of stable righteousness who laughs at the time to come, and communicates
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.840]   that when you have God you can be strong and laugh in the face of uncertain
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.480]   futures. And then I would say honor the leadership and the protective instincts
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   of your husband. As the church submits to Christ, wives submit in everything. So a
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.120]   son should see a strong woman deferring to the initiatives and leadership, the
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.600]   spiritual leadership of a strong man. Now I'm of course assuming that this man is a
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.560]   believer and is taking that, and you do what you can if that's not the case. But
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.320]   if you've got an intact spiritual marriage, what a son needs is to see that
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.680]   woman doing that. In the home I grew up in, it was stunning. It was just
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.400]   stunning. My dad was away from home two-thirds of the year. My mother did
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.240]   everything. She was omnicompetent. She taught me just about everything I know
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.080]   when he was away, and she never once gave me the impression she couldn't do
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.560]   anything. She could paint the house, she could push a wheelbarrow. I watched the
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.840]   sweat drip off the end of her long nose as she weeded the Bermuda grass out and
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.360]   showed me how to take care of the yard. She taught me how to make french fries
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   in deep grease and wait until it's hot, otherwise they're gonna get soggy. She
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.120]   taught me how to flip pancakes and wait till the bubbles appear around the edge
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.760]   because if you turn it over before then they're gonna spill out over the edge of
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.840]   the spatula, and on and on and on. She was pouring out wisdom, and when my dad
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:56.280]   came home, my mother beamed with joy that he could now lead in prayer at the table.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.480]   He could now say, "Let's go to church." He could now say, "Let's go out to eat." He
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.320]   could pull the chair out for her when he sat her down. He would open the door for
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.800]   her when he went through it. I watched all, I watched those, that dance, that
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.240]   choreography, and I marveled at my mother. That in his absence she could be
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.440]   everything, and in his presence she loved it when he took that kind of initiative.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.120]   That's what we need to show our sons so that they are not belittling or
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.020]   demeaning in any way when they're taking initiative for the sake of a woman. And I
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.760]   would say, point the son to strong manhood in Scripture, in history, in
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.200]   fiction, in media, in her husband. And I don't mean necessarily physical brawn.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.760]   Don't give the impression to the boy that he's not masculine if he's not an
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.800]   athlete. What I mean is true masculine, protective, initiative-taking, courage and
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.600]   strength. And a guy who's into art, who loves the arts, has a more
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.720]   sensitive spirit, don't let him think he's less a man. Don't give the
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.760]   impression, "Oh, you're not really a man if you don't hunt and carry a gun and
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.400]   tackle football." No, no, no, no. There is a masculinity that is strong and
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.440]   initiative-taking and courageous and protective, and she needs to show him
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:30.080]   that in all the ways she possibly can. And maybe one last thing. Expect, expect
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.480]   strong manhood from him. Give the boy responsibility early on. Ask for his
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   manly behavior. Insist on politeness towards his sister or towards you,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.600]   letting you go first through the door and showing him how to open a door,
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.480]   showing him how to use respectful language, training him how to treat girls
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:00.200]   in a respectful and protective way. So those are some ideas. I'm sure there's
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:08.920]   there's lots more, but I think, Tony, that a mom and a dad should see God's wisdom
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:16.360]   in creating homes with a mother and a father, both of them bringing something
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   remarkably unique to the sexual wholeness of both sons and daughters. So
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.040]   mom and dad are both important for son, mom and dad are both important for
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.920]   daughter, and if you're in a marriage where you're a single mom or a single dad,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.440]   God will have mercy. God will provide. God will make up the differences if you keep
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.320]   all these things in mind, I think, and make up for the losses in various ways.
