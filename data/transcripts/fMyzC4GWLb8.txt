[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Most of you will remember that we are engaged at the moment in studying the 15th verse in
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.320]   the 8th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.800]   The 15th verse in the 8th chapter.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:23.560]   "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.480]   of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.680]   Now we really have finished our exposition as such of this great and all-important verse.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.840]   We are regarding it as one of the proofs that the Apostle supplies us with of the fact that
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.120]   we are the children, or the sons of God.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.000]   We have been delivered from the spirit of bondage.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We are not returning to that.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.160]   The spirit that we have received is not a spirit of bondage, but it is a spirit of adoption
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.400]   whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.440]   And we last week were considering some of the manifestations of this spirit of adoption
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:23.880]   and especially this cry, this elemental cry, this profound cry that the spirit of adoption
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.320]   causes us to utter, saying, "Abba, Father."
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.440]   And we likewise looked at the content of the words "Abba" and "Father."
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.480]   We saw that at one and the same time it includes not only this sense of sonship, but this intimate
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.360]   personal knowledge of God.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.160]   It is like the little child going to the father, moved by this sense of relationship and of
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.400]   sonship, so that the word repetition of the same meaning, first in the Aramaic and then
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.920]   in the Greek, is not a mere repetition, but is intensive and it is repeated in order to
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.400]   remind us that this is the kind of thing that when moved and animated by the filial spirit,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280]   inevitably does.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.040]   Now then, that is the point at which we have arrived.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.120]   But there seem to me to be two matters that call for urgent consideration before we can
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.760]   leave this great statement.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.560]   The first is this.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.180]   It seems to me to be essential that we should remind ourselves again very clearly that this
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.000]   is not essential to salvation.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.600]   Now you notice how I am putting it.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.640]   To have the spirit of adoption whereby we cry "Abba, Father," I am saying, is not essential
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   to salvation.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.680]   You can be a Christian and know nothing about the spirit of adoption whereby we cry "Abba,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   Father."
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.420]   Now when I say that, I am well aware of the fact that I am saying something that the majority
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.960]   of the Protestant Reformers would not have agreed with.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.440]   The Protestant Reformers tended to teach—I mean by that Luther and Calvin in particular,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.200]   but others also—that assurance of salvation was a necessity to salvation.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.860]   They did not draw a distinction between salvation itself and the assurance of salvation.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.220]   So they tended to teach that a man was not saved unless he knew he was saved, unless
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.640]   he had the assurance.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.140]   And there are people who still say that.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.720]   They say that it is inconceivable that a man who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.640]   is born again has not at any rate some kind of assurance of his salvation.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   But now this is a very important point, obviously.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.080]   If we are going to say that everyone who is a child of God must have the spirit of adoption
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.440]   whereby he cries "Abba, Father," in the sense that we were indicating last week, well,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.720]   then I think you see immediately what happens.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.920]   It means that we are saying at once that a very large number of people whom we have always
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.160]   regarded as Christians are not Christian at all.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.880]   And there are some who do not hesitate to say that.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.480]   I was reading a modern American author only the week before last, and he did not hesitate
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:50.120]   to assert that he thought that at least ninety-seven percent of people who are members of churches
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.800]   and who claim to be Christians are not Christians at all.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   And his reason was this, that they have not assurance of salvation.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.440]   That they say they believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, but if you ask them, "Well, do you
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.400]   know that your sins are forgiven?"
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.560]   Well, they say, "I would not like to say that."
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.840]   Do you know that you are a child of God?
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.240]   They say, "Well, I believe I am, but I am not prepared to say that I know I am."
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   They have not got this spirit of adoption whereby we cry "Abba, Father."
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.560]   And therefore he does not hesitate to say that they are not Christians.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.000]   And therefore his estimate is that only some ninety-seven percent of people who claim to
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.920]   be Christians are patently, therefore, not Christians.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.560]   Now then, if his premise is right, well, then his deduction is right.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.680]   And that is what makes this matter so important.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:57.200]   If you do insist that every Christian must know that he has this spirit of adoption,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.520]   which leads him to cry "Abba, Father," well then, it is very certain that there are large
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.920]   numbers of people who call themselves Christians and who have always believed themselves to
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.000]   be such, are rarely not such at all.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.200]   Now let's remember this, that we have no right to water down this statement in any way.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.240]   I pointed out to you, I emphasized that the word "cry" is a very strong one.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.800]   This is not my idea.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.400]   All the authorities are agreed about this.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.660]   It is an elemental cry.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.660]   It comes from the depths.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.280]   It is not just saying "Abba, Father."
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.080]   It is crying "Abba, Father."
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.480]   There is nothing deeper than this.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.280]   The apostle to the—the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, you remember, tells us in
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.560]   chapter 5 about our Lord himself, clearly in the Garden of Gethsemane, that this is
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.480]   the way in which he there uttered "Abba, Father."
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   You remember we were quoting last week how our Lord there in his agony in the Garden,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.800]   he likewise used the expression "Abba, Father."
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.280]   And here he puts it in chapter 5, the seventh verse of his epistle, "Who in the days of
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.560]   his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying," that's
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.040]   it, "and tears."
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.040]   It's not a mere speaking.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.080]   It's a very profound emotion.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.720]   And that is what the apostle says that this spirit of adoption always leads to.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   Very well.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.880]   Now, that is the position that some would take up, but it seems to me that that position
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.480]   is not tenable at all.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.360]   The compilers of the famous Westminster Confession of Faith, they saw that this was not so, and
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.960]   that it was certainly causing a great number of truly Christian people to be in trouble.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.720]   They drew a distinction between being saved and knowing that you're saved.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.520]   They said that you can be saved, and yet lack assurance, that assurance is not essential
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.880]   to salvation, and that is undoubtedly right.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:15.560]   The whole notion, surely, of justification by faith only, insists upon our saying that.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:23.520]   Because the justification by faith only means that you believe you're resting on that,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.440]   whatever your feelings may chance to be.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.720]   So there is an essential difference between believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and trusting
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.800]   to him for salvation, and believing that you have it in him, and having this inward assurance
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   of it.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.960]   There is one reason why I'm asserting that this spirit of adoption is not essential to
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.920]   salvation.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.840]   But then I have a second reason for saying the same thing, and that is what we've already
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.700]   seen in verse 14.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.300]   We came to the conclusion that a man who can say that he is being led by the Spirit
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:10.780]   of God is a man who is a Christian, and that that is a ground of assurance.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.300]   But it is possible for a man to be able to say, "Yes, I am convinced that I am being
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:22.980]   led by the Spirit of God," and still not have the spirit of adoption whereby we cry,
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.920]   "Abba, Father."
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.580]   There is a vital distinction between the two.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.700]   These are steps, each one going higher than the previous one.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.780]   And you remember, we interpreted verse 14 in terms of some nine or ten questions, and
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.740]   I venture to say that if you could say yes to any one of the questions, you were undoubtedly
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.140]   a Christian.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.080]   If you could say yes to all of them, you could be quite certain you were a Christian.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:54.020]   But all of those taken even together come short of the spirit of adoption within whereby
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.860]   we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.860]   Very well, then.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:06.300]   So I am bold to repeat my assertion that this spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba,
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.620]   Father," is not absolutely essential to salvation.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.740]   But then there is still one question remaining under this heavy.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.860]   There are people who say, "Surely, as you read your New Testament, you are given the
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.500]   impression that everybody has got this spirit of adoption."
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.300]   The apostle here does not say some.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.700]   He says, "You have not received the spirit of bondage against the fear, but you have
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.060]   received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:41.180]   He seems to be writing about all the Roman Christians, and the parallel statements everywhere
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.820]   else in the New Testament seem to be saying the same thing.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.980]   Well, what is the answer to that?
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.900]   Well, here again the answer seems to me to be quite clear.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:59.060]   I have no doubt at all that most of these early Christians, if not all, had full assurance,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.060]   and for this reason.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.820]   The New Testament times were times when the Holy Spirit had been poured forth in unusual
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.820]   profusion.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.780]   You see what you read in the second chapter of Acts, and that seems to have been repeated
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.260]   wherever the gospel first went.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.940]   There was a mighty authentication of the truth.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.500]   The Spirit fell upon them.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.420]   In other words, it was a kind of exceptional revival.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.160]   And during such times, you generally find that the majority of people are in the happy
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.740]   state and condition of enjoying a great assurance of salvation.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.140]   Now as most of the New Testament epistles were written to such people, it is not at
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.980]   all surprising that they are written on the assumption that they all had had this great
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:53.700]   experience which leads to this spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father," and even
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.980]   beyond that, to what we shall later be considering in the sixteenth verse, about the Spirit himself
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.460]   bearing witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.440]   So that to me is no difficulty at all.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:16.100]   It is quite clear that the Church at the beginning was in this exalted condition as regard experience,
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.580]   a condition which has not persisted, alas, in the subsequent history of the Christian
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:28.660]   Church, but which, as I say, you see from time to time during an awakening or a period
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.620]   of revival or unusual reformation.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.620]   Very well.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.980]   I leave that point just there.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.000]   And come to a second matter, which is this.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.660]   How is this spirit of adoption received?
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.520]   You notice the term that is used.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.340]   He says you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:01.260]   the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:08.060]   Now there are many, no doubt, asking the question, "How can one get this spirit of adoption?"
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.420]   People say, "Well, I can't say truly that I've got that.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.940]   I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:19.620]   I've seen perfectly clearly that I can't rest upon my own works nor on anybody else.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:26.020]   I am resting solely upon the Son of God and his perfect work on my behalf.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:32.300]   But I cannot honestly say that I have within me this spirit that you were describing last
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.720]   Friday night.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.740]   I cannot say that I've ever cried out as the child, "Abba, Father."
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:45.380]   You emphasize that it was subjective, that it was a feeling, not a man persuading himself,
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:52.660]   not deducing from the Scriptures, but an elemental feeling within, something that had been poured
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.500]   in by the Spirit, leading a man to cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.700]   How can one obtain this?
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.700]   That is the great question.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.060]   Well, now it's the most important question.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.780]   And it is a question concerning which there is a great deal of confusion.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:16.180]   I sometimes think that there is perhaps greater confusion concerning this particular point
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:22.860]   in evangelical circles than concerning any other single matter.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:32.540]   Because there is a teaching which, misunderstanding a text like this and many others, put before
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:39.060]   us the teaching which goes under the name of "Take it by faith."
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.900]   Now you're familiar with this teaching.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.940]   It says, "As you took your justification by faith, take your sanctification by faith
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.860]   in the same way.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:54.380]   Take the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Spirit by faith in the same way, the fullness of
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.340]   the Spirit, take it by faith."
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:01.960]   And they would even say that, many of them, even with regard to physical healing.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   You know the teaching.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.580]   It says, "Now don't you be concerned about your feelings.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.220]   Take the Word of God.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.820]   Believe it, accept it, and then go to God and thank him."
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.260]   That you have received, though you may not feel anything.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.580]   Act on the Word of God.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:22.580]   Take it by faith and immediately return thanks to God for it.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.580]   Now that is the teaching.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:32.140]   In other words, as they come across this word "receiving," they put the whole of emphasis
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:39.780]   upon what we do, upon our taking, upon our believing.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:47.060]   It's all our voluntary action that we, by faith, lay hold upon this thing, and therefore
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.700]   it becomes ours.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:56.820]   Now I say that this is, to me, one of the greatest causes of confusion in much of our
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.140]   evangelical thinking.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.420]   I know of nothing that robs so many people of this great New Testament experience so
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.740]   much as that particular teaching.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.980]   And yet, you see, the tragedy is the teaching is offered so as to enable us to get the experience.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:17.100]   Now I'm so concerned about this that I want to put it to you in the form of a quotation.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:23.060]   I could take many quotations, but here's a book which somebody sent me only a few weeks
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.340]   ago and I was reading it and I thought, "Well, here it is once more, so let me read it to
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340]   you."
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.300]   Here's a man writing and this is what he tells us.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.580]   How is this baptism with the Holy Spirit received?
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:45.620]   God's word says, "Receive ye the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.620]   faith."
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.620]   Galatians 3.2.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.820]   And again, "He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.500]   you, doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith."
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.820]   Galatians 3.5.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:06.620]   "Receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.060]   Galatians 3.14.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:16.740]   The way of receiving this blessing is not by works, nor by law, nor by excitement or
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.020]   noisy demonstration.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:25.020]   The only way to receive the baptism with the Spirit is by faith.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.580]   But why have so few received this gift?
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.500]   Because this gift is for the thirsty, and so few are thirsty.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.380]   If one is living in sin, there is no thirst.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.780]   Drinking of the world's cisterns never really satisfies and will take away the keen edge
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:50.180]   of the real thirst that causes one to come to Christ for this great gift.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.300]   Another important fact that we need to understand is that it is Jesus Christ who gives this
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.460]   gift.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.740]   From his own invitation in John 7 and also from the words of John the Baptist, we learn
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.460]   that Jesus Christ is the baptizer.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.700]   And then he has got quotations to prove that and to demonstrate that from our Lord.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:17.020]   Peter also definitely designated Jesus Christ as the one who poured out the Spirit in that
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.780]   wonderful experience.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.740]   For he said on the day of Pentecost, "Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted,
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.620]   and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.820]   which ye see and hear."
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:36.380]   This verse clearly shows that after his exaltation, it was Jesus Christ himself who received this
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.940]   wonderful gift and now pours it forth, in bracket, gives it.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.660]   Thus, from first to last, Jesus Christ remains the center of our Christian experience.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:52.060]   This is very important and absolutely essential, lest one be led off from the truth of the
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.340]   centrality of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.340]   All right.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   Then he goes on.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.860]   "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink," Jesus said.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:08.380]   Thus, Jesus compared this experience of receiving the baptism with the Holy Spirit to a thirsty
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.580]   man drinking water.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.300]   And how does one drink?
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.180]   Drinking is the easiest and most natural thing in the world for a person to do.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:24.180]   One who is thirsty does not have to be taught how to drink, for he simply opens his mouth
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.260]   and takes in.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.380]   Drinking is as easy as that.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.100]   The application is clear.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.780]   The Holy Spirit is a definite person, and though we cannot see him, he is all around
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:40.220]   us, like the air, he is here, and at the same time in China and in Africa and in India.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:47.860]   In receiving the baptism with the Spirit, it may help to tell the Lord, "I know that
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.300]   the Spirit is here.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.100]   I am thirsty for him.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.660]   I want him.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.740]   May he come upon me now.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.180]   May he fill me now.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:02.540]   Just as I breathe in this air, I receive thy wonderful Holy Spirit."
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.540]   Now, there it is.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.740]   Then he goes on to quote, "F.P.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.940]   Meyer's experience of the baptism with the Holy Spirit may prove both interesting and
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.300]   helpful to those who are seeking the Lord.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:22.060]   In his book, The Christ Life for the Self-Life, he writes, "I had been a minister of a large
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:28.020]   influential church, but I was very unhappy, for I was conscious that I had not received
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.620]   the power of the Holy Ghost.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.300]   Then I went up to that little village, Keswick, where a great number of God's people had gathered
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.100]   to seek and receive the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   One night they had elected to have a prayer meeting from nine o'clock to eleven, and
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.780]   onwards to pray for the Holy Ghost.
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:52.020]   I joined them and found a great many people were agonizing.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:58.500]   But I was too tired to agonize, and somehow felt that God did not want me to agonize hour
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.540]   after hour.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.100]   I had to learn to take."
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.060]   In italics.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.220]   God wanted to give.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.340]   I had only to take.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.340]   That is what little children do at mealtime.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:20.220]   For instance, tomorrow, your little girl will come down to breakfast very hungry.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.180]   The bread and milk or the oatmeal is on the table.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:29.140]   You do not say, "Little girlie, run upstairs and agonize.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.580]   Roll on the floor for an hour and then come down."
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.700]   You say, "Little one, I am so glad you have a good appetite.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.340]   Now there is your chair.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340]   In you get.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.340]   Say your prayer and start away."
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.140]   That is what God says to the soul.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.220]   All nights of prayer for the Holy Ghost are principally necessary to get people who pray
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.820]   into a fit condition to receive the Holy Ghost.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:00.220]   For when the people are ready, the Holy Ghost will come without agonizing.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.380]   So I left that prayer meeting at Keswick.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.580]   It was eleven o'clock on half past ten and I crept out into the lane away from the village.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.260]   As I walked I said, "Oh my God, if there be a man in this village who needs the power
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.700]   of the Holy Ghost to rest upon him, it is I.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.700]   But I do not know how to receive him.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.820]   I am too tired, too worn, too nervously down to agonize."
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:30.180]   A voice said to me, "As you took forgiveness from the hand of the dying Christ, take the
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.700]   Holy Ghost from the hand of the living Christ."
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:41.280]   I turned to Christ and said, "Lord, as I breathe in this whiff of warm night air, so
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.020]   I breathe into every part of me thy blessed Spirit."
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.620]   I felt no hand laid upon my head.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.580]   There was no lambent flame.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.900]   There was no rushing sound from heaven.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:23:00.940]   But by faith, without emotion and without excitement, I took for the first time and
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.980]   I have kept on taking ever since.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.700]   I turned to leave the mountainside and as I went down the tempter said, "You have
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.700]   got nothing.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.700]   It is moonshine."
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.500]   I said, "I have."
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.660]   He said, "Do you feel it?"
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.780]   I said, "I do not."
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.700]   "Then if you do not feel it, you have not got it."
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:26.460]   I said, "I do not feel it, but I reckon that God is faithful and he could not have
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.900]   brought a hungry soul to claim the Holy Spirit by faith and then have given him a stone for
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.500]   bread and a scorpion for fish.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:41.060]   I know I have him because God led me to put in my claim."
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:46.580]   Now I have read all that to you because it is a typical and a characteristic statement,
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:52.460]   both by the author of the book and his quotation from the famous F.B.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.460]   Meyer.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.780]   And you notice they both say the same thing.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:01.700]   The whole of the emphasis you see is upon our taking.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.020]   Receiving is interpreted in terms of our taking.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.500]   It all depends upon whether we are ready to take.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.900]   Whether like the little child we sit down at the table and take of the food that is
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.660]   there before us, whether we breathe in the air that is round about us.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.980]   It is our taking that is emphasized, our taking by faith.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.420]   And you notice that specifically they say that you can thus take the Holy Ghost in this
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.620]   gratefulness and feel nothing at all.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.980]   That is a part of the whole statement, that you must pay no attention to your feelings.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.540]   It is a pure act of faith.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.860]   And now you notice that their case is based upon certain passages of Scripture which they
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   quoted.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:51.220]   Galatians 3, verses 2, 5, and 14.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.020]   And also John 7, verse 39.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:01.060]   Now they mean this, that in the Galatian passages Paul turns to them and says, "Received ye
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:06.820]   the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.260]   And the others repeat the same statement.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:18.740]   And our Lord, in John 7, verse 39, the explanation is given that our Lord was speaking about
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.740]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.300]   And that the Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:32.100]   It says that he was talking about the Spirit that they should receive who believed on him.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   Now this is a very important point, obviously.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:44.460]   It's clear, you see, that they are dropping into a confusion in this way.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:52.660]   The statements on which they rely in Galatians 3 are concerned to emphasize that the Christian
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:26:00.780]   is in a position not as the result of works, but as the result of his faith.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.340]   But what they forget is that the apostle there is dealing with nothing but justification
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.260]   in the first instance.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:13.460]   But then when he goes on to the Spirit, he asks his question, "Did you receive the
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.100]   Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:27.820]   Now they interpret Paul's dismissing the reliance upon works to mean this, that these
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:33.780]   people had received this gift of the Spirit in the same way as they had received their
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.540]   justification, by an act of faith only.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.140]   But of course the apostle doesn't say that.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:47.780]   What the apostle is concerned to say is this, that the whole position of the Christian is
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.660]   one of faith.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.500]   That the Christian is a man who does not rely upon his works.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.580]   Everything in the Christian life ultimately is based upon faith.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.940]   Now the apostle is really not saying any more than that.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:10.220]   He is not saying that in detail the gift of the Holy Spirit came to them in this particular
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.020]   way that our two authors describe.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:19.860]   All he is saying is that you received the gift of the Holy Spirit because you are in
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.260]   the position of faith.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:28.140]   However, let me give you some further reasons for saying that.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:35.820]   Surely this other teaching, though it reminds us that the Holy Spirit is a person, nevertheless
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.700]   seems to forget immediately that he is a person.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.660]   Immediately they fall into the fallacy of talking of the Spirit as if he were a liquid
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:50.580]   that could be poured out, or as if he were like the air which can be breathed in.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:59.260]   But the answer to that is that the Holy Spirit is a person, and he is God, the third person.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.860]   And you and I cannot take the Spirit like this, just as breathing in whenever we like
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.460]   and whenever we choose.
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.160]   What we are taught is that we have to be subject to the Spirit.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.300]   We have to surrender to the Spirit, and we have to be very careful not to grieve or to
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.980]   quench the Spirit.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.980]   But there is never any suggestion that we can take him like this, in this simple and
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.740]   almost natural manner.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:28.940]   The teaching seems to me to do violence to the very person of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.240]   But rarely the trouble arises over this word "receive."
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:41.900]   That seems to me to be the heart of the trouble, because they interpret the word "receiving"
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:47.500]   in terms of an activity on our part, upon our taking.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.100]   Now I've got to go into this.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.540]   It's going to be a little bit technical, but it's got to be done, because this matter
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.300]   is to me one of the most urgent in evangelical thinking at the present time.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.260]   So I go into it in detail in this way.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:09.660]   If you consult your New Testaments in the original, you'll find this, that the word
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:19.620]   "received" is used in our translation to translate several different words.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.180]   Now there are many words used in the Greek, but they're all used and translated here
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.180]   as "received."
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:32.420]   Here's a very interesting discovery which you will make at once.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.100]   You will find that all the words that are used in the Greek which are translated as
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:46.380]   "received," except the one that is used here, are always words that carry an active
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.820]   sense, not a passive sense.
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:57.060]   They are words which put their emphasis upon our activity, upon our taking.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.940]   All the words which are used and are translated as "received," with the exception of the
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:08.340]   one we are looking at in Romans 8, 15, have a very definite active sense.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.860]   Now let me give you an example or two.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:16.060]   Take for instance one which we came across in our reading at the beginning tonight in
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.980]   Acts 2, verse 41.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:30.180]   "Then they that gladly received his word were baptized.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.660]   And the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls."
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.220]   Now it's obvious, isn't it, from the whole context that the word "received" there
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.980]   has a very active sense.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.700]   Here was the apostle Peter preaching.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.340]   Some believed what he said and some didn't.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.060]   What we are told is that they that gladly received, those that believed and took his
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.380]   word, were baptized.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.180]   It's obviously an active sense.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:02.300]   The same thing you will find in Acts 18 and in verse 27.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:09.580]   "And when he was dispersed to pass into a chair, the brethren wrote, exhorting the
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.180]   disciples to receive him."
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   I needn't stay.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.880]   It's obviously an active sense.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:25.020]   And you've got the same thing again in Acts 28, in verse 30.
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:33.380]   "Be it known therefore unto you, brethren, that the salvation of God is sent unto the
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.900]   Gentiles, and that they will hear it."
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.940]   Is the translation.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.540]   But it's the same word as was used in the other instances I've given you, and therefore
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.860]   it might very well be translated as "received."
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.900]   "Be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles,
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.500]   and that they will receive it."
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.940]   Obviously an active sense.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.980]   Now let me give you an example of another word.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.060]   Not the same one as we've been dealing with, but another word again, but it's translated
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.060]   "received."
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.660]   You'll find it in Acts 22 and in verse 18.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:19.640]   "And saw him saying unto me," Paul's describing his vision in the temple, "And I saw him saying
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:27.340]   unto me, Make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.860]   testimony concerning thee."
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.420]   In other words, they're going to reject it.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.420]   Clearly the word again is a very active word.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:41.360]   It means to accept, to admit, or to delight in.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.420]   But then let me give you yet another word.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:50.860]   And here's another word which is found in this epistle to the Romans in chapter 14 and
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.580]   in the first verse.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:33:01.340]   "Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations."
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.220]   And again in the third verse of that chapter.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.780]   "Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:15.140]   judge him that eateth, for God hath received him."
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.100]   Obviously it's an active sense.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:24.540]   If you'd like to make a note of Philemon, verses 12 and 17, you will find the same thing.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:30.300]   Philemon, Paul is writing to Philemon and asking him to receive Onesimus.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.540]   He might not want to, but he's urging him to do it, so it's an active sense.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.940]   And then you've got another word again in Philippians 2.29.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.380]   I haven't time to read these quotations.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.860]   Look it up for yourself.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.580]   It means to admit into intercourse.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:52.060]   You've got the same word and another word again in Matthew 18.5.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:57.460]   Now here, some of these are interesting and we must just glance at them.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:11.820]   Matthew 18.5, "Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me."
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.460]   Obviously an active sense, isn't it?
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:20.820]   You've got it again in Acts 8.14, this same word that we're looking at at the moment,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.700]   Acts 8.14.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:28.620]   Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.300]   God, they'd believed it, they'd taken it, they'd accepted it.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.980]   Obviously an active sense.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:40.540]   You've got the same in Acts 11.1, in Acts 21.17, but then here's a very interesting
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.500]   one in 1 Corinthians 2.14.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:53.180]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.180]   him.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.900]   Well it's obviously in a very active sense, isn't it?
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.340]   He doesn't receive it, he doesn't take it.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.740]   He rejects the thing.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.560]   Clearly very active.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:12.660]   And you'll find the same meaning in Galatians 4.14, in Colossians 4.10, James 1.21.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.940]   The word means take, accept.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:22.700]   Now all these words that I've been considering with you there are obviously active and put
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:28.820]   their stress and their emphasis upon our taking.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.660]   Yet all those words are translated by the word receive.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.660]   Now what about the word that is used in our text, Romans 8.15?
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.600]   This is a different word.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.860]   Not one of the words we've been looking at.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:52.620]   Now if you turn up the two best lexicons on this grim fare, or the one I was quoting the
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:59.100]   other night, Aunt Gingrich, you will find that they both agree in saying this.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.540]   That this word is used in two main senses.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:08.060]   One of them is a more active sense, and the other is a more passive sense.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.900]   And then they go on to give us their examples.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:21.340]   Here is our word used in an active sense in Matthew 26.26.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:27.380]   It's the word in our text, remember, but it's used in this active sense.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:35.460]   And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:40.700]   the disciples and said, "Take, eat, this is my body."
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.180]   Now it's the first part there.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.660]   Jesus took bread.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.380]   It's the same word, but it obviously has an active meaning.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.900]   It's something that he took.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.800]   There's one example of this.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:02.060]   Then there is another one in Luke 20 and in verses 28 to 31.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.540]   We've got to go through this in order to establish this most important point.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.860]   Luke 20, 28 to 31.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:14.700]   Here our Lord is dealing, you remember, with the question that was put to him, that catch
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:21.400]   question put by the Sadducees about the woman who married seven different brothers.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:27.420]   And you get this word repeated, saying, "Master, Moses wrote unto us, if a man's brother
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:33.380]   die having a wife and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife and
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.340]   raise up seed unto his brother."
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.940]   And then they go on.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:42.620]   The second took her to wife, the third took her, and so on.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:47.700]   Now the word translated there as "took" is the word that we've got here twice in Romans
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.860]   8, 15.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:56.020]   Then another very important example of this is in John 1, 12, which reads like this.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:04.140]   "But as many as received him," as many as took him, as many as believed on him.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.740]   It's the active selves.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:12.060]   Those who actively, voluntarily, and willingly believed on him, received him.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.620]   To them gave he the power to become the sons of God.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:20.420]   Now that's a very important and a very significant one, as we shall see in a moment.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:25.220]   The next is in John 5 and in verse 43.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:34.100]   "I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not."
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.660]   Obviously it's active, isn't it?
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.220]   He says, "You're rejecting me."
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.540]   But he puts it, "You receive me not."
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.740]   It indicates an activity on their part.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.380]   You've got the same thing in John 10 in verse 18.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:53.780]   John 10, 18, "No man taketh it from me," talking about his life, "but I lay it down
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.940]   of myself."
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.380]   I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.860]   This commandment have I received of my Father.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.420]   It's in John 12, 48.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.140]   It's in John 17, 8.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:15.260]   Let me give you that last one, John 17, 8, which reads in this way.
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:23.340]   "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them."
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.740]   These are the people.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   These are the followers.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.060]   He says, "I'm not talking about the world."
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.060]   These are the people.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.700]   "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.660]   have surely known that I came out from thee.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.220]   They have believed that thou didst send me."
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.980]   Obviously it is again this active sense.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:47.540]   And another example is in Acts 27, 35.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:52.580]   Now then, there are examples of the active sense of this word.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.380]   But then they tell us that the same word is used in a more passive manner.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:05.100]   And here it means to receive what is given, to gain, to get, to obtain.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.700]   Not once does it mean to take, but it means that I get something, that I gain something,
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:16.140]   that I obtain something, that I receive what is given.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.020]   Now what are the illustrations of this?
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.140]   Well, here are some of them which they give us.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:28.380]   The first I'm taking from Matthew 7 and verse 8, which is a familiar one.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:34.540]   "Everyone that asketh, receiveth.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.420]   He that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened."
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.740]   Everyone that asketh, receiveth.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.180]   Now that's passive.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.460]   It doesn't mean that everyone that asketh, taketh.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.540]   No, no.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.980]   To everyone that asks, it shall be given.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.060]   That's what it means.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.540]   The emphasis is upon the giving here, not upon the taking.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.620]   Quite a different meaning.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.300]   It's passive and not active.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:05.940]   You've got the same thing in Matthew 20 and in verse 9, where I read this.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:11.460]   "And when they came," these are the laborers, you remember, hired for the vineyard, "and
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:20.220]   when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny."
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.420]   You suggest to me that that was active?
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.380]   The whole context tells us that it wasn't.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.180]   They were very annoyed.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.220]   It wasn't that they took in this active way the penny.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.620]   They would have liked to have had much more, but that's all they received.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   That's all they were given.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.700]   You see, it's passive here.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.500]   They received every man a penny.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.860]   Far from being active, it was very passive indeed.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.020]   The point is that that is what they were given.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.860]   So it's important to differentiate here.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.500]   Now let's go on again to John 1.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:01.540]   We've already looked at John 1, 12, but now let's look at John 1, 16 to see the difference.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:08.820]   John 1, 12, "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God."
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:18.900]   John 1, 16, "And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace."
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.620]   See, it's not the same thing at all.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.440]   The first verse tells us about people who believe on him.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:31.340]   The second verse tells us what the people who believe on him are given, what they've
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.340]   received.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.220]   "Of his fullness have we received."
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.540]   We've been given of his fullness.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.700]   We've gained something of his fullness.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.600]   It's entirely passive.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.540]   So different from what we had in that twelfth verse.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.100]   My time has defeated me again, so I must just give you a list of my verses.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.900]   You've got the same thing in John 7, 39.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:01.060]   Then in the book of Acts you've got a whole series of this passive sent.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:11.400]   Acts 7, 53, Acts 10, 43, Acts 16, 24, Acts 20, 24, Acts 26, 10.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.020]   Let me just pick out one of them.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:19.860]   Let me take Acts 10 and verse 43, because it is a very interesting and a very important
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.860]   one.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:26.300]   It's the case of what happened in the household of Cornelius, you remember.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:34.420]   "To him gave all the prophets witness that through him, that through his name, whosoever
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:39.700]   believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.340]   You don't take remission of sins, you receive remission of sins.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.420]   You are given remission of sins.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.820]   You don't take it, you receive it.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:54.660]   How different the whole atmosphere and context is from the activity of the words that we've
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.660]   been looking at previously.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.180]   Then go again to 1 Corinthians 2.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.900]   What an important chapter that is.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.440]   Now we've already looked at it, as we saw it, in verse 14.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.820]   But let's come and look at an earlier verse.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.820]   1 Corinthians 2, verse 12.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.980]   This is what I read.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:22.660]   "Now we have received not the spirit that is of the world, but the spirit which is of
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.900]   God."
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.300]   What he's saying is this, the spirit we've got, the spirit we've been given.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   You see, in talking about the natural men in verse 14, it says the natural men received
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   not.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.420]   There's an activity.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.140]   But what he's saying here is this.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:44.860]   He says, "These things God hath revealed unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.180]   all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.220]   He says this is the spirit we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.780]   that is of God.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.980]   God has given us this spirit.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   That's the emphasis.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.060]   There's no activity here.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.900]   There's no talk about taking.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.860]   It's telling us what we've received.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:09.140]   And you've got the same thing in 1 Corinthians 3, verse 8, where we read, "Now he that planteth
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:16.580]   and he that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own reward according to
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.580]   his own labour."
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.180]   Well, no, there's no emphasis on taking there.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.900]   What he's saying is this, that in the day of judgment, every man is going to get his
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.460]   own reward according to his own labour.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.380]   There's no emphasis on what he wants.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.420]   "I'll be taking actively as if we are breathing in the air.
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.020]   This is what will be meted out.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.760]   This is what will be given."
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.580]   But it's translated rightly, "receive."
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.560]   Every man will receive his own reward.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.020]   And you've got the same thing in the 14th verse of that chapter.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:54.740]   "If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.220]   But you don't put the emphasis upon the man stepping forward and taking?
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   Of course not.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:04.420]   It is given to him in the graciousness and the goodness and the kindness and the love
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.860]   of God.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:13.420]   And then you've got the same thing in 1 Corinthians 4, verses 7 and 9 and 24.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:18.180]   You've got the same thing in 1 Corinthians 14, verse 5.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.600]   You've got it in 2 Corinthians 11, 24.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.560]   You've got it in Hebrews 2, 2.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.440]   Now here's an important one.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:31.920]   This man is telling them why they must be very careful to hold on to the gospel.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:37.040]   We must pay the more earnest heed to the things that we have heard, lest at any time we should
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.040]   let them slip.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:46.200]   For if the word spoken by angels were steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:54.320]   a just recompense of reward, every transgression and disobedience received, is there any notion
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.320]   of taking there?
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.680]   Of course there isn't.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.000]   It's all giving.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.040]   The emphasis is upon the giving.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.040]   And so on.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.200]   There's Hebrews 2, 2.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:09.120]   You've got it in Hebrews 11, 8, 11, and 13.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   Look them up.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   Read them.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.080]   In James 1, verses 7 and 12.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.600]   In James 3, the first verse.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.800]   Is it worth looking at this?
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.120]   Well, let me just read that one to you.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:28.280]   James 3, 1, which reads like this, "My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:33.040]   receive the greater condemnation."
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.440]   Do you take that in as you breathe the air?
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.840]   Can you take in condemnation as if you sit down and eat your meal?
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   Of course not.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.120]   It's entirely passive.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:46.520]   We shall receive the greater condemnation.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:54.880]   It's the same in James 4, 3, and in James 5, 7, which reads like this, "Be patient,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.280]   Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:08.120]   for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.520]   Does the farmer take the early and the latter rain?
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.320]   No, he doesn't, but he receives it.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   It's poured down upon him.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.600]   It descends upon him.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.320]   But it's said that he receives the early and the latter rain.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.160]   These senses of the word "receive" are entirely passive.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.600]   You've got the same thing in 1 Peter 4, 10.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:34.480]   You've got the same thing in 2 Peter 1, 17.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.960]   Let me read this one.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:41.800]   "Where we are told about our Lord with Peter and James and John on the Mount of Transfiguration,"
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   and this is what I read, "for he received from God the Father honor and glory, when
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:53.920]   there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.280]   am well pleased.'"
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:04.800]   You've got it in 1 John 3, 22, where John is saying this, and an important statement
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.360]   it is.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:14.320]   He says, "And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.200]   do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.320]   And then there are many examples of the same thing in the book of Revelation.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.360]   Finally, to complete my list of quotations and to close the meeting tonight, you've
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:34.440]   got a whole series of this same passive meaning of this self-same word in this, our very epistle
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   to the Romans.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.640]   Let me give you the list.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.600]   First of all, chapter 1, verse 5.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   Paul is talking about himself.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:52.200]   He says, "By whom," by the Lord Jesus Christ, "we have received grace and apostleship."
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.480]   Paul didn't take his apostleship; it was given him, and he never got over that fact,
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.520]   that Christ should ever have given it to him.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:06.280]   We have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:14.800]   You've got it in chapter 4, in verse 11, where we read, "And he, Abram, received the sign
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.480]   of circumcision."
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:21.920]   He didn't take it; it was put upon him, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.960]   he had been yet uncircumcised.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.920]   It's again in chapter 5, in verse 11, which reads like this, "And not only so, but we
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:40.760]   also join God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   Entirely passive.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   It's come to us.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.000]   We've got it through him.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.520]   Not our taking; it's what's been given to us.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:55.600]   And the last example is in Romans 13, and in verse 2.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:02.080]   "Whosoever therefore resisteth the power"—he's talking about the powers that be, that are
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:09.800]   ordained of God—"whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God;
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:18.840]   and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.960]   Obviously it's entirely passive.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:31.160]   Well, now there, I have taken you through this technical list of words and meanings,
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:36.400]   and I had hoped that I would be in a position to deduce from that and to work out my argument,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.440]   but I just cannot; my time has entirely gone.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.240]   Now we've got to leave it, I'm afraid, at that, therefore, for this evening.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.200]   You see what I'm doing?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:54.280]   The important matter before us is the exact connotation of this word "receive."
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:59.680]   You have not received the spirit of bondage against a fear, but you have received the
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.560]   spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father!"
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.360]   Is this something that I can take whenever I like?
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.520]   As long as I believe, I just take it, and though I may feel nothing, say, "I've
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.520]   got it.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.520]   I've got the spirit of adoption."
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:22.840]   Now, work it out in terms of these technical matters that I've put before you.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.080]   Let me say in passing a thing that I don't often say.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.800]   I've never worked so hard in my life before a Friday night meeting as I have to get all
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.200]   this evidence.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.760]   And I do trust that you will see with me the significance of it all when we come to the
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   deductions.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.120]   But now, perhaps it's a good thing we haven't got time.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.200]   Go through all my illustrations and examples.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:50.800]   Look up these words in their context and see if you can arrive at the inevitable deduction
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.680]   with regard to this matter.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:58.760]   Well, we leave it at that, and God willing, we will proceed to work it out next Friday
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   night.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   Let us pray.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:08.360]   O Lord, our God, we again would humbly thank Thee for the wealth that Thou hast given us
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.080]   in Thy Word.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.800]   O Lord, we know not how to thank Thee sufficiently.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.120]   We see that concerning so many matters, Thou hast given us this light and knowledge and
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   instruction, and yet we are so slow to avail ourselves of it.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.800]   We again plead Thy pardon and forgiveness.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:35.280]   O Lord, have mercy upon us, and O we ask Thee, as the result of our deliberations together
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:42.520]   this very night, O God, we pray Thee, cause us to give ourselves with a new diligence
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:49.520]   to searching the Scriptures, that we may arrive at a knowledge of the truth that shall fill
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:56.840]   us with a joy unspeakable and full of glory, and enable us to cry from the very depth of
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.840]   our being, "Abba, Father."
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:05.160]   O Lord, hear us and grant us this great blessing.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:12.360]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the love of God, the fellowship
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:18.640]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:26.880]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.560]   Amen.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
