[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So a quick and impossibly deep question,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   last question, about mortality.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.820]   You've spoken about death as an interesting topic.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.180]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Yeah, every day.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.960]   It's really scary.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.240]   - So what do you think is the meaning of life
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.560]   that mortality makes very explicit?
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.560]   So why are you here on earth, Michael?
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.780]   What's the point of this whole thing?
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:45.200]   What does mortality in the context of the whole universe
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.640]   make you realize about yourself?
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.300]   Just you, Michael Stevens.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.200]   - Well, it makes me realize that I am
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.860]   destined to become an ocean.
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.840]   I'm destined to become a memory and we can extend life.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.120]   I think there's really exciting things being done
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.520]   to extend life, but we still don't know how to like,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880]   you know, protect you from some accident that could happen,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520]   you know, some unforeseen thing.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.360]   Maybe we could like save my connectome
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.800]   and like recreate my consciousness digitally.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.640]   But even that could be lost
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.800]   if it's stored on a physical medium or something.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   So basically I just think that embracing
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.200]   and realizing how cool it is that like someday
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   I will just be an idea and there won't be a Michael anymore
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.400]   that can be like, no, that's not what I meant.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.740]   It'll just be what people like,
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.960]   they have to guess what I meant and they'll remember me
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.040]   and how I live on as that memory
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.820]   will maybe not even be who I want it to be.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.160]   But there's something powerful about that
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.480]   and there's something powerful about letting
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.200]   future people run the show themselves.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   I think I'm glad to get out of their way at some point
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.920]   and say, all right, it's your world now.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.960]   - So you, the physical entity, Michael,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.560]   has have ripple effects in the space of ideas
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.520]   that far outlives you in ways that you can't control,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.360]   but it's nevertheless fascinating to think,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.840]   I mean, especially with you,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   you can imagine an alien species when they finally arrive
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.880]   and destroy all of us would watch your videos
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.200]   to try to figure out what were the questions.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.680]   - But even if they didn't,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.640]   I still think that there will be ripples.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.680]   Like when I say memory,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.840]   I don't specifically mean people remember my name
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.320]   and my birth date and have like,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.840]   there's a photo of me on Wikipedia,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.100]   like all that can be lost,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.200]   but I still would hope that people ask questions
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.680]   and teach concepts in some of the ways
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.560]   that I have found useful and satisfying.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.000]   Even if they don't know that I was the one
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   who tried to popularize it, that's fine.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.520]   But if earth was completely destroyed,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.960]   like burnt to a crisp, everything on it today,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   the universe wouldn't care.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.740]   Like Jupiter is not gonna go, oh no.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.920]   And that could happen.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.760]   - That could happen.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.360]   - So we do however, have the power to launch things
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   into space to try to extend how long our memory exists.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.880]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.160]   we are recording things about the world
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.680]   and we're learning things and writing stories
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   and all of this and preserving that is truly what I think
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.820]   is the essence of being a human.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.840]   We are autobiographers of the universe
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.900]   and we're really good at it.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.200]   We're better than fossils.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800]   We're better than light spectrum.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.040]   We're better than any of that.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.720]   We collect much more detailed memories of what's happening,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.120]   much better data.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.600]   And so that should be our legacy.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.440]   And I hope that that's kind of mine too,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.720]   in terms of people remembering something
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.080]   or me having some kind of effect.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.840]   But even if I don't, you can't not have an effect.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.480]   That's the thing, this is not me feeling like,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.120]   I hope that I have this powerful legacy.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.320]   It's like, no matter who you are, you will.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.000]   But you also have to embrace the fact
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.640]   that that impact might look really small and that's okay.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.760]   One of my favorite quotes is from Tess of the D'Urbervilles.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   And it's along the lines of the measure of your life
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.200]   depends on not your external displacement,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.360]   but your subjective experience.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.040]   If I am happy and those that I love are happy,
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.980]   can that be enough?
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.380]   Because if so, excellent.
