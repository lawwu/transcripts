[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   I write the script in December, January, Josh Arnett, Marlee Shelton, come down, fly Frank in,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.420]   shooting for 10 hours on my green screen. We shoot that opening sequence.
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.080]   Incredible opening sequence. And the visual look, we've never seen that. I want to just take this
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.460]   and make it move. I just want the comic to move. Any other studio would just go make it look like
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.520]   any gritty crime movie and they would miss the point that the visual is half of it. I want it
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.920]   to look just like this because it would be the boldest movie anyone's seen because that's how
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.360]   it reads when I read the book. It's like, if this was moving, it would be the most phenomenal movie.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.260]   Just by being around him and working with him, you get, by osmosis, you learn stuff.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.480]   And it just ups your game because they're just swing way beyond you. Jim Cameron was like that.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.500]   So like when I first met him, I was trying to impress the hell out of him, you know,
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200]   because I was such a big fan. I was about to go do Desperado and I went, hey,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.660]   I just took a three-day Steadicam course because I can't afford a Steadicam operator. So I'm going
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.220]   to operate Steadicam myself on Desperado. Now, if he was just my peer, he'd say, oh,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.160]   I did the same thing and I'm going to do the same thing. That would be like hanging out with somebody
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.740]   of your ilk, but you don't, you want somebody who's above that. Do you know what he said? He goes,
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.820]   I bought a Steadicam, but not to operate it. I'm going to take it apart and design a better one.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.860]   Us mere mortals trying to learn how to operate the camera. He's designing all new systems. That's the guy
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.900]   you want to hang out with. Not someone who's doing what you're doing. We put so much of the world
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.980]   around them. Like when you see the city, we put like a blue screen way in the back to just make the
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.340]   city keep going. But we built the sets there, the town, we built the real set. So everything was very
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.300]   tangible and real. And that way she had to fit into that world and be as real as that. Because if it was
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.640]   all done in CG, well, then now you can fudge everything. But if you put her in a real environment,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.060]   that's a real challenge. And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart. You watch this
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.400]   thing blow up. You watch this thing not work. Everything just falls apart in front of your
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.440]   face. Then that's when you roll up your sleeves and creatively figure out a way around it. And by
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.100]   the end, you have a result that's better than what you sought out. Sift through the ashes of your
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.140]   failure and you'll find the key to your next success is in there. But if you're not looking for it,
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.260]   you don't find it. The following is a conversation with Robert Rodriguez, a legendary filmmaker and creator
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.600]   of Sin City, El Mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids, Machete, From Dusk Till Dawn, Alita, Battle Angel,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.780]   The Faculty, and many more. Robert inspired a generation of independent filmmakers with his
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.440]   first film, El Mariachi, that he famously made for just $7,000. On that film, and many since,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.800]   he was not only the director, he was also the writer, producer, cinematographer, editor, visual effects
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   supervisor, sound designer, composer, basically the full stack of filmmaking. He has shown incredible
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   versatility across genres, including action, horror, family films, and sci-fi. With some epic collaborations
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.400]   with Quentin Tarantino, James Cameron, and many other legendary actors and filmmakers. He has often operated at the
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.880]   technological cutting edge, pioneering using HD filmmaking, digital backlots, and 3D tech. And always, through all of that,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.340]   he's been a champion of independent filmmaking, running his own studio here in Austin, Texas, which, in many ways, is very far away
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.440]   from Hollywood. He's building a new thing now, called Brass Knuckle Films, where he's opening up the filmmaking
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.680]   process so that fans can be a part of it, as he creates his next four action films. I'll probably go hang out at his
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.340]   film studio a bunch, as this is all coming to life. His work has inspired a very large number of people, including
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.300]   me, to be more creative in whatever pursuit you take on in life, and have fun doing it.

[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.020]   dear friends, here's Robert Rodriguez.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.520]   Has there been a
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   time when there was like one take, and you only have one take to get it
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.360]   right? Oh, all the time, where you're just like, or just you know how long it'll
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.620]   take to reset, and you're just, but then you know what you, you, you gotta just work
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.160]   with what you got, you know, you gotta look with, work with your results.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.220]   You get nervous, or no, in that moment?
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.020]   Oh, yeah, you're, you're nervous going like, just, I hope it goes off, because then, to fix
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.980]   it, I'll have to go do a bunch of other steps, which we don't have time for. But a lot of times,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.800]   you know, I've just learned that if something happens, it's just meant to be that way.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.400]   And, uh, and I got used to doing things in one take, and just living with it, it didn't bother
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.180]   me. One movie, it was even a low-budget movie, they had, um, rigged a car to implode, because
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.040]   I was going to throw a guy at it. So we needed a car to implode, and then we're going to throw
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.100]   them and marry it together, right? And, um, the stunt, and the, the car guy goes, yeah, we're
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.480]   going to have three cars rigged. Three cars? Why are you not, well, in case one doesn't
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.700]   work, and then we have a second one, I have to throw them. We said, we don't have all night
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.760]   to go shoot take after take. We're doing just, just get one car, and if it doesn't work, we'll
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.800]   figure it out. You know, because you don't have time to do it again sometimes. It's such a long
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.320]   setup. So I'll go, no, I'm, I'm good with just going, what, in a grindhouse movie, they only had
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.220]   one take, so that'll make it more authentic. When it all goes to shit, when it fails, you just,
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.980]   what's the next thought? So I'll tell you, two things happen on Just Till Done. First was,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.560]   okay, you know how those explosions, when somebody walks away in slow motion from an explosion,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.980]   that's become kind of, you know, that started with Desperado? Desperado's the first. If you
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.700]   look at all the montages, Desperado's the first. That's right. That is the meme. Because it was an
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.880]   accident, it was just supposed to be, it was just two grenades, not a nuclear bomb. He throws them
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.860]   over the side, and I just wanted, like, some body parts or, you know, something to fly up, some
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.920]   shrapnel. It literally says shrapnel, and my effects guy was so ragged, running so ragged, we get to
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   there, and I go, do you have any body parts of stuff we can throw up, or something you can shoot up?
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.460]   Pat, I didn't realize it's so high to get past that second floor. He's like, no, I don't. I can give
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.660]   you a fireball. I can give you a nice, you know, fireball with propane, but it burns away really
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.720]   quick. Like, how fast? Like that, but it'll be big and orange. Okay, we'll shoot it in slow motion,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.680]   so it lasts a little longer, because it just goes poof. So I told the actors, I know how big this
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.740]   fireball is going to be, but just walk really fast, and just look real determined, and then just keep
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.360]   walking. Don't stop and turn around, because you might get your eyebrows singed. So they take off,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.440]   and boom, it goes, and in slow motion, it looks great, right? I remember showing it Jim Cameron
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.080]   before it came out, and his hand went up, like, you've never seen that before, you know. Six months
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   later, Dust Till Dawn came out. So I liked how much it looked so much that in Dust Till Dawn,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.020]   I did it again. So those movies came out within six months of each other. That's why it turned into a
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.220]   thing, because people saw it. And so I thought, how about for the opening of George Clooney and Quentin
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.140]   walking out of the gas station, that we have the whole place just blowing up, and they just keep
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.580]   talking like it's not happening. You know, like, take it another step further, so I'm not just doing
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.060]   the same thing. Okay, that one, it's like, okay, you're going to walk out, and it's all in one take.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.380]   So we're only going to do one take. We're going to blow the thing up. We're going to start with just,
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.440]   you know, some smaller explosions, and then when they're further away, and it's safer, then we'll do
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.140]   the big fireballs. So we're going, and you're nervous, because like, if one of them trips up a
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.760]   line, and you know, the pressure's on them, it's not just you that's nervous. You're nervous for them.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.480]   They're the ones who got to walk out, do that whole speech, get in the car, and drive away. What if the
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.220]   car doesn't start? What do you know? There's a lot of things that could happen. Well, guess what happens?
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:41.720]   The thing you would not expect, they go in, they come out, they start talking, shoot it. It's
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.220]   perfect. Great. We can move on. And the camera guy goes, I don't know what happened, but just like
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.420]   you had a little snafu here, he goes, we have an autofocus on the steadicam. I mean, we have a focus
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.920]   thing. It just went like this. I felt it go whack all the way out of focus, and whack for a second
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.880]   back. Like, it just reset itself. I don't know why it did that, you know, because it's radio
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.740]   controlled. And we can't tell because we're shooting film, you know, sort of like, oh,
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.600]   shit, let's watch the dailies, sure enough. Let's see if we can get, maybe I can scratch
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.980]   the film right there. No, it goes completely out of focus and back in focus within a second.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.980]   Now we got to reshoot it. So we had to wait till we're back in that location. We rigged
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.820]   it for two more takes, just in case. So that thing that was supposed to be the one take is
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:31.600]   three takes. The other thing that happened was the front of the Dust Till Dawn bar was
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.500]   that same guy that did those explosions. He packed a bunch of explosives behind the actors.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   When the actors come running out of the, of the bar at the end of the movie, and there's
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.040]   an explosion through the door because all the vampires are blowing up. He didn't just, he
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.180]   put like 10 times. So it blew out. You see it in the movie. You see this huge fireball
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.780]   going up. And if you watch closely, you see it already start to catch the whole place on
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:02.700]   fire. The whole front of that, which is foam catching on fire. And I cut just before you
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.340]   see that it's on fire. And we, that was the first shot at that bar. Cause we weren't going
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:14.100]   to start shooting the other stuff till night. So the first shot is that, and the sets ruined
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.920]   burned or crisp. The neon lights blew up. So we couldn't even shoot. Cheech goes, well,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.140]   I guess I'm not doing my speech tonight. And, but right away, this is what, this is what happens.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:33.860]   My first AD, Doug Arnachowski comes over to me and I go over to him. The guys came out with
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.680]   the fire hoses, the fire hoses weren't even adding water. It was like, the thing was just
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.400]   scorching. The whole production design team was in tears because they had just spent weeks building
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.200]   this thing and it was up in smoke and charred. I said, let's just keep shooting. Let's just keep
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.920]   shooting because it looks really kind of cool like this. Yeah. They're going to have to come repair
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.000]   it and we'll have to come back, but it's all black and charred. That's why that whole scene with
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.860]   George Clooney and Cheech and that the building's black. We didn't go over there and touch that up.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.820]   That's real flame that burned and it ended up looking great. So then the next week when
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.520]   we came back to shoot that other shot that didn't work, we came back and they had repaired it and we
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.600]   shot all the night stuff, which is the majority of the stuff in front of it. So sometimes you got to
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.000]   roll with it and then, and look, look at the blessing you get because of this mistake. You probably
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.920]   actually got a better take by doing it later with them. And then you had this incredible look for the
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.460]   end of the movie that looked apocalyptic. If it had looked just clean, you would have actually seen
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.260]   that it was kind of a foam set. This made it look better. So I kind of let the universe push you
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.240]   where you're supposed to go. Just roll with it. You got to roll with it because you don't know what
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.960]   the grand plan is. You have your plan. Just know it's probably all going to fall apart.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.060]   It's just like the movies. You come up with your plan of what you want to accomplish. That's like
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.080]   your script. Then you go scout your location and figure out what your project's going to be,
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.920]   you know, and you go try to make it as bulletproof as possible. Then you go to do your project.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.360]   And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart. You watch this thing blow up. You watch this thing
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.700]   not work. Everything just falls apart in front of your face. Then that's when you roll up your sleeves
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:09.140]   and creatively figure out a way around it. You turn chicken shit into chicken salad. And by the end,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.540]   you have a result that's better than what you sought out. But that's the process and that's life.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.140]   And that's wash, rinse, repeat. The rest of your life, that's what everything's going to be like.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.200]   It's just like a movie. Because when you think about it, you're writing a story for a film.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   And you're also writing the story of your life at the same time. Like how are you going to react to
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.820]   things? Well, how do you make your character react to things? You make him kind of superhuman. Why
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.020]   don't you just make yourself that way? You're writing your own story. And you start really seeing the more
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:40.620]   you get into storytelling that life imitates art and art limitates life, but the process is also the same.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.200]   So you write the story, the script, and then you have it collide with the chaos of reality. And in that
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.720]   moment, when you said you see the chicken shit, like you have to be able to keep your eyes open.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.020]   You have to do that.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.420]   You have to do that.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.780]   Wait a minute. Okay. Stuff changed.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.360]   Discipline.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.780]   Where's the, not to be cliche about it, but where's the silver lining of this? Where's the path to
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.400]   actually make something good out of this? And that's a skill, right?
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.260]   I call it, and it's one of my favorite stories. I was doing one of these talks and they said,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.600]   come talk about creativity. I go, I understand. Cause a lot of people read my book,
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.760]   rebels had a crew and told me, Oh, it made me be a filmmaker. But a lot of people said it helped me
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.040]   start my own business because they just see how you can go be entrepreneurial like that and go
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.900]   where no one else is going. And I'm giving all this talk about this kind of positive stuff.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.520]   And this one woman goes, you're real positive, but what do I tell myself when I just wasted a year
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.500]   and a half of my life doing something that didn't work? And I was like, that's a real negative way to
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.240]   ask that. Can you just rephrase the question a little more positively before I even attempt to answer it?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.500]   Because already her point of view is, is exactly what you're saying. She's not looking at all.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.960]   She's just concentrating on what, what didn't follow her plan and not seeing the gift of everything else
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.720]   that's there. So she goes very reluctant. So perfect. I wish we had filmed it. She goes,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.580]   I learned a good lesson the hard way. And I said, that still sucks. And I say, when you follow your
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.500]   instinct, like if you follow your own instinct to go start a business or go make this movie or that,
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.520]   it wasn't someone saying go over there and you'll make a million dollars. You know,
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.340]   it was your instinct and you fail. Sometimes the only way across the river is to slip on the first
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.340]   two rocks. You fail. You have to really sift through. It's like the silver lining, but I call it
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.940]   sift through the ashes of your failure and you'll find the key to your next success is in there.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.060]   But if you're not looking for it, you don't find it. I'm going to tell you one. And I tell them
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:34.900]   the four room story. I said, I made a movie called four rooms. I didn't make any money. Right. When
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.200]   Quentin asked me, Hey, would you want to make a movie with me and two other filmmakers? It's an
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.820]   anthology. It's on new year's Eve. It's in a hotel. You have to use the bill hop. We're not going to know
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   what each other's making. And we make it, we put it together. My hand went up right away. Just
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:53.360]   instinctually. That sounds, yeah, I'll do that. I'll go make that with you. Now, should I ask the
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.520]   audience? I like to throw it to the audience and her. Should I have not raised my hand that quick?
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.500]   Shouldn't I have done a little studying first or should I just go blind instinct or should you do
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:09.560]   instinct with some studying? Okay. Well, I could have gone and studied and I would have found that
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.000]   anthologies never work. Like even when it's Coppola, Scorsese, Woody Allen, they bomb because people
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.620]   can't quite rip their hand. What is this? Twilight Zone? I don't want to go see that.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.920]   But that's not, I still said, yeah, I think I should still go by instinct. So my instinct was
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.380]   to raise my hand. Will you go make that movie? Because I love short films. I made like bedhead
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.440]   in short films and I thought, oh, here's a way. If this works, I can make short films in anthologies
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.300]   and I can have the best of both worlds. And by the way, anthologies is when there's multiple.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.960]   More than multiple one story. In one movie. Yeah, one movie.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.660]   So if you did the research, you would know that very few people ever got that to work.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.180]   Yeah. The audience can't quite wrap their hand and it feels like the movie starting three times,
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:56.060]   you know? So I make that movie. It bombs. Now I could feel real bad about that, but if you really
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.880]   think about it, you go, well, why did I sign up for it? Did I raise my hand because I thought it was
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.760]   going to go be this big financial success? No, I did it to work with my friends, to do something
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.120]   creative, to try something, but that's still not good enough. I need to really sift through the ashes.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.800]   And if I looked into the ashes of that failure, I find two keys to my biggest successes in there.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.880]   While I was on the set, they said it has to be New Year's. So I thought, I'm just going to do like
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.220]   bedhead. I'm going to have two little kids that are running around in this room and we have to use the
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.020]   bellhop as a babysitter. Well, it's New Year's. Let's dress everybody in tuxedos because it's New
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.840]   Year's. They're all going to go out, but the parents leave without him. When I saw Antonio and his wife,
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.560]   I thought, wow, they look like a really cool international spy couple. What if they were
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.140]   spies? And these two little kids, one of them keeps falling asleep on the set. He's so young.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.040]   They barely tie their shoes. They don't know parents are spies. They have to go save them. Okay. There's
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:53.520]   five of those movies now, right? The other one was I really love making short films. I really want
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.240]   this anthology thing to work. What if it's three stories, like a three extra, not four, same director,
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.840]   not four different directors. I'm going to try it again. Why on earth would I try it again? Well,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.320]   because I'd already done one and figured out how I could do it better. And that's Sin City. Those are
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.080]   by far two of my biggest successes that came directly from that failure. So I always say,
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.280]   follow your instinct. If it doesn't work, just go. Sometimes the only way across the river is to slip
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.400]   on the first two rocks. So what is, where's the key in that, in the ashes of the failure? Because if I had
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.520]   an instinct, that means I was on the right track. I didn't get the result I want. That's because the
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.960]   result might be something way bigger that I don't have the vision for, and the universe is pushing
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.660]   me that way. By the way, a lot of people that look back to four rooms see a lot of creative genius in
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:45.400]   there. So you say it flopped. It flopped financially. Financially. But there's so many ways to measure
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.060]   success. Totally. But like I said, I would say, well, it was successful because even Roger Ubert said,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.020]   hey, you furnished my favorite room. I was like, yeah, that's, I could take that. But now that I
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.260]   think there's something else still there. I keep sifting in this, like, oh yeah, two big successes
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:05.160]   came from that. It's an amazing lesson to have because it makes you feel better about failure.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.380]   Think of like The Thing by John Carpenter. You put that movie out the same weekend as E.T.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.540]   That thing bombed. Critics were calling it pornography, you know, because of all the weird special
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   effects and audiences didn't go either. And he thought he made a great movie. So, you know,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.200]   it makes you question your instincts. Well, 10 years later, turns out, oh, it's a classic. So
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.820]   sometimes it takes the audience a while. So if you have some kind of failure on something, you don't
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.340]   let it knock you down. Just go, maybe in 10 years, they'll think it's great. I'm just going to commit
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:42.400]   to making a body of work, a body of work. Some will succeed, some will overperform,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.220]   some will underperform. It's not your job. You just want to be a creative person.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:51.640]   Just create, I tell you, just create, stop thinking about movie per movie and worrying so much about
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.780]   each one or project to project. If you're a business person, just commit to making a body of
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.240]   work like an artist would do. And you don't, you don't know what the masterpieces are going to be or
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.340]   which, you know, someone's going to come and say, oh, that, that one that bombed. I, there is some
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.540]   really creative stuff in there and it's not for you to decide. You just go and do it.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.220]   And sometimes I think it takes some time to process the failure to make sense of it.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:21.780]   Like, uh, uh, at least for me, don't rush making sense of what didn't work. What lessons do I
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:27.600]   take from it? How do I sift through the ashes? As you said, like it takes time. You have to sleep
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.720]   on it. Sometimes it's right there. And then sometimes you come back, revisit it, you know,
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.520]   later. Cause you might not have had some information you have now that makes you look
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.260]   at it a lot differently. Like when I did, I just, uh, did the audio book for rebel without a crew.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.540]   Thank you for that. By the way, I hadn't read it since I wrote it. So I didn't remember a lot
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.640]   of the details and you actually it's voiced by you. I voiced it. So I was reading it real time.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.960]   Yeah. I highly recommend people. Cause you comment, you add additional comments to it. It's great.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.000]   Most of the time I'm laughing because I can't believe how crazy that story is. I forgot a lot
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.920]   of details. And when you're younger, you know, when you're 21, 22, six months feels like six years. I
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.180]   didn't realize how short that window was until I reread it and how impossible most that is. But you see
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:16.000]   some places where a setup falls in my lap and then pays off immediately in a big way, like magic over
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.040]   and over again. It's clear. I don't know what I'm doing. It's clear. The universe is just pushing you
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.820]   places. So you can't fight it because I remember I was really disappointed. And it says in the,
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.780]   in the diary, I'm really bummed that I go home that Christmas, not having sold it
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:34.620]   to the Spanish home video market, which was my goal. I walked home penniless and I was like,
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:40.400]   Merry Christmas. I feel like a frigging failure. Good thing. I didn't sell it then. No, you know,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.180]   with time you look back and you go, wow, I got an agent the next month. He wasn't even going to help
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:50.120]   me sell it. He said, Oh, if you can get 20,000 for it, take it. I chased those people down for those
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:57.460]   contracts to Spanish market for months. And they never answered me back. And then Columbia ended up
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.480]   buying it for like 10 times as much. And we made it re we released it and did a sequel and did another
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:09.080]   sequel. If you look back in time, good thing. I didn't get my way. My way had had this for a vision
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.280]   and it needed to do that, which you would never know. You know, you don't know that going through.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.780]   So just if you don't have the answer right away, or even in 10 years ago, maybe it's coming in 20
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:24.200]   years. Don't let anything slow you down. Just keep plowing forward, committing to making your thing
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.620]   happen. Don't, don't get shook up by something that you might not have an answer for. Yeah. Every
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.560]   aspect of your journey is super inspiring. We'll talk about it. Let's go to the beginning. There's
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.400]   a few technical things that are fascinating about your beginning. So you started making films when you're
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.920]   very young with an old super eight camera and you were editing on a VCR. You see, I've met a lot of
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.800]   filmmakers who, you know, they start a certain way, but then they finish another way. They get to be
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.820]   big filmmakers and all that. I still do it that way. Like I still, I like doing things that way.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:00.140]   I have a new company called brass knuckle films where the audience can actually participate by
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.480]   investing in this movie and investors in these movies that are done the same way. They're action films
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.100]   like we did with Mariachi, but 10 to 30 million. It doesn't take a lot of money to start a billion
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.860]   dollar franchise. You know, like John Wick only cost 20 million. The first one, second one was 40.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.000]   Third one was 80. Fourth one was a hundred because the audience kept growing and growing.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.240]   By the way, you say, you know, 20 million, like it's not in a lot of money. We should mention
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:28.760]   an action film. Yeah, that's right. But also we should say that El Mariachi, the, the, the film on
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.960]   which the book rebel without a crew is $7,000 movie. So let's put it all in context.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.220]   But you know, you know, you're going to hire bigger actors. You can get a big actor, like
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.520]   Tiana Reeves for a $20 million movie. You know, I asked Jim, I said, Jim Cameron, I said, you know,
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.140]   like Terminator costs 5 million. And he goes, I wish we had that much. He had less than 5 million for
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:53.540]   that. So you can start a billion dollar franchise using these methods. And, uh, and with the audience
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.000]   investing, they get to make money on them. And this is what I'm going to say now about how I started.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.660]   You see that DNA of how I give out, you know, I want people to know how I did things with rebel
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.220]   without a crew or with these methods that I started with. You see, that's how we kept going. Hollywood
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.280]   spends way too much. And when you can make stuff for less, your profit margin is much better.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.400]   So when I first started, I didn't have any money. So I still play like I don't have money.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.280]   So I had super eight, my dad had a super eight camera, but I couldn't afford it.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:29.940]   I shot two rolls that you had to get to, you had to buy the film, shoot two minutes. I shot two
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.480]   rolls of that. It's another same amount of money that it costs to buy it, whatever that was, 12 bucks
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.600]   or whatever to develop it. You get it. There's no sound. Most of the shit's out of focus, you know,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.700]   but then my dad who sold cookware had a VCR, one of the first VCRs, home VCRs for the market that he
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.020]   would play his sales tapes to his salesman. And it came with a camera attached like this
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:57.220]   cable you got coming out. Imagine if that had to go into your VCR for you to even see what it's
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:03.600]   shooting. And this is old camera, manual focus, manual iris and 12 foot cable. And I would start
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.200]   making movies with that instead. Now I have for $8, I have a two hour erasable tape of sound and
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.800]   picture. So I got into digital basically really early. I was doing, which was really frowned upon back
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.380]   then and continued to be all the way to when I was using it for real in the early 2000s before
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.420]   everyone realized, oh, that's the future. Yeah. That's fascinating. Cause you were
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:30.120]   rebel in that way too, using digital. Yeah. Well, cause of the means and the democratizing of that,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.900]   the elite didn't like that. You could just go make a movie like that, but I started practicing
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:41.480]   and it's much easier to practice when it doesn't cost any money. Like if you want to be a rock star,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.880]   right? If you want to learn how to play guitar really well, you're not going to just jump on stage and
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.360]   suddenly go to play. You have to practice to your fingers bleed. Well, the same with movies,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.800]   you got to keep telling stories and cutting them together. And you just can't afford that on film.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:57.160]   Nobody can with two minute roll costing as much as a two hour tape. So I was moving all these,
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.200]   doing all these movies. First, I would cut in camera and that VCR, that old VCR had a really great
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.960]   pause button that they stopped making that when you hit pause, it stopped right there. And it stopped
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.680]   with a clean cut. It didn't have all this color bars like the later ones had. So I, that was my,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.380]   and it had an audio dub feature where you could add another second soundtrack to it.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.220]   So if I have people talking, I could hit audio dub and add sound effects. So I could have two tracks on
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:29.640]   the same one. So I, that was my filmmaking kit for a while until I needed to start doing real editing.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:36.560]   And my dad bought a second VCR for his business. Cause I stole his other one and I found that if I hooked
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:43.360]   them together, I could play on one and use that pause button on the second. And this was the limitation.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.120]   This would taught me how to edit in my head is that if I shot a bunch of footage, I needed to shoot very
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.540]   little footage so I could find it. Cause sometimes you shoot out of order. So when I cut it, I have to cut
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.520]   in linear order because if you push pause, it's a nice clean cut, but only, it only holds for five
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.120]   minutes. You have five minutes before the machine shuts off. So you got to find your next shot within
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.300]   five minutes and do that. Otherwise, if you have to start the machine over, it added all these color
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:14.360]   bars and it would be all screwed up. So I'd have to sit there and not move for like all day while I cut
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:21.760]   knowing what the next shot was. And once I had it cut, I would then add some sound effects to it.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.340]   Remember, cause I have the audio dub function, but now if I want to add music, I take that tape,
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:32.820]   which has two tracks now into the first deck and put it into the VCR again, one generation of loss,
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.840]   but I have a little cassette tape player with the music and I do a Y splitter so I can add the music
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.420]   yeah. Right. Just like that. That's like being resourceful with what you have. And I made a
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.820]   award winning short films that way on video. There were some festivals that would allow video, not
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:56.840]   many, but they would always win. And there were always funny as, uh, I stumbled upon spy kids that
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.420]   way. Like I wanted to make these action movies in my backyard, but when you're a teenager, you don't
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.600]   know anybody who can come be your action star. And if you just bring your high school buddies, well,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.800]   they just look like high school kids. So I use my little brothers and sisters cause I'm one of 10
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.640]   third oldest. They're just sitting around watching cartoons anyway. And I made them the action stars
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.800]   just to like learn. And I found those things would be a winning formula. They'd win every festival I'd
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   send them to. So bedhead was my first time using a film camera. It was a windup film camera. I got in
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.680]   film school. I went to film school for one semester and realized I already knew more than the film
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.620]   students. Cause they, they taught you a whole other outdated way of doing it. So I thought,
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:42.480]   I'm just going to use that film camera camera to make a, a low budget movie, a definitive film
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.500]   version that I can send to all film festivals of these action kids, which is a precursor to spy kids.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.060]   Bedhead is a precursor to spy kids. And we should say that bedhead was an award winning short film.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.880]   That was probably a big sort of leap for you that probably opened the door to you to then make all
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.860]   your, your, your brain, especially because those video festivals, I would win like a trip to New
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.340]   York and a director's chair with a video shorts that I would put in festivals, but I knew the film
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.960]   festival, if I could get into film festivals, I could send that all over the world. So I made that little
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.820]   short film, sent it and it was winning all the festivals. And I thought, wow, I made that with a
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:28.960]   wind up camera, film camera filming, just one take each shot, just no slates. Cause I'm the editor and
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:38.000]   that cost 800 bucks. And it was eight minutes. I bet I can make an 80 minute movie for $8,000 if I'd
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.560]   use the same method. So that movie I did six months later, I was making mariachi because it opened up my
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.380]   mind to that. I could try it in a feature. Can we actually pause on that? Because I think
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:52.960]   a bad head has a really great, really unique story shot in a really unique way. I think what I'm trying
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:00.040]   to say is like, it's very important to write, write the right script, write the right story.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.360]   So let me tell you the trick to that. And mariachi is the same way. And this really helped people.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.560]   Like even Kevin Smith from clerk said, wow, Robert said when mariachi was success, I talked about how I
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:16.960]   did it. And I said, I, I, I looked at everything I had. What do I have? We have a pit bull. We have a
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:23.000]   turtle. We've got a bus that Carlos's cousin owns. His cousin is a brother has a brother-in-law has a
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.540]   bar and he owns a ranch. So the bad guy lives at the ranch. The fight scene is going to be in the bar.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.120]   He's going to hit a bus at one point. He's going to, the girl's going to have a dog and a turtle is
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.360]   going to cross the road. It gives you all this production value. So you write backwards. So for bedhead,
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.740]   I even did that with a camera. So I've been shooting video all this time. And one thing I
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.880]   wished I could do on video, I never could with slow motion or stop motion even. So when I got that
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:52.140]   crappy world war two camera, they gave us in film school, I mean, I was so pissed. Like this is the
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.700]   camera I've been trying to get my hands. I could have bought this for 50 bucks at a bond shop, old
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:01.240]   Bill and how wind up. You couldn't even see through the lens. You were seeing through an approximation of the
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:07.900]   lens, but you could shoot slow motion. I could do reverse photography. If I filmed upside down,
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.560]   I could do, cause if I do a fast push into her, I'll never get the focus in. Right. So I started
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:20.920]   with it in focus, went back, pulled backwards on a chair and then reversed it, flipped it. And that
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.800]   looks like it stops on a dime and focus.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.300]   Yes. The number of times I've seen you shoot backwards is incredible. Like to achieve a certain
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:33.800]   feeling, a certain experience, a certain, uh, certain effect, sometimes shooting in reverse,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:42.440]   plus the sound effect layer, you can create this reality that's surreal. Yeah. That then results in
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.480]   the story that you wanted. Like you have, you have to be functioning some kind of different space,
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.820]   time continuum. Start putting it together. Right. So I've got this different camera. Well,
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.120]   what now I go like, oh, no, I don't want to shoot the same kind of movie. If I got a camera now that
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.280]   can do that, I can do stop motion. So that's why there's an animated title sequence at the beginning.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.640]   Cause I go, wow, I I'm a cartoonist. If I set the camera up here, I can slow it down enough. It's not,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.400]   it's not a frame by frame, but if I get it down like two frames a second, I can just tap it and it'll
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.320]   maybe get one frame off. So I did 300 drawings by hand for that opening title sequence. Holy shit.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:25.400]   That was, that was you doing it by hand. Yeah. So you watch that and this is a throwaway title
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.700]   sequence, but I really want to, this thing to win awards. Okay. Hold on a second. How long did that
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:35.260]   take to draw that? That's a lot. That's a lot of work. I drew it. I drew it over. Well, I was a daily
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.260]   cartoonist by then, so I was pretty fast, but still it's, that's why it's only penciled. It's not inked,
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.260]   but it looks great. I mean, it's the cameras going around and all kinds of crazy stuff,
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.700]   but it's just all fake by paper. I took me all night to shoot it. Cause I remember I walked into
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:54.140]   the film school the next day, you know, like all sleeping. And I told one of the fellow students,
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.240]   you know, wow, I was up all night doing this animated title sequence. And he went,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.620]   why are you putting so much work in this? They're not going to, they're not going to grade you any
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.900]   differently. And I was like, grades, get an A walking in here. I'm trying to get out of this town.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.160]   I'm not doing this for fucking grades. I got, I want people to see what I can do now.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.820]   And I want to see what I can do now with this. So a lot of the story came from the limitations or
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.200]   actually the freedoms of that camera. I couldn't have done that story on video. So when I saw,
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:28.240]   wow, okay, I can do reverse photography. I can do stop motion. She has to have special powers
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.520]   because if she has special powers and I can utilize, I can really milk this camera for all it can get.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.920]   There's one of my shots. I love the most is where she's standing there and the, and the chair,
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:44.320]   she makes a chair come all the way up to her and it goes all the way up to her face. Now,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.980]   if I did it normally, where would I even put the strings for that?
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.120]   Right. To pull the chair. Yeah.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.480]   So I started here with the camera upside down. I have the strings in the back. You're not going
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.320]   to be looking at the back. And as it goes back, you pull it back. And then when you reverse it,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.120]   it goes, and it looks so good. You can't spot the string. If you look close, you see the strings
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.660]   are in the back, but your eyes don't look. So I did stuff like that. And then just her like getting
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.520]   the hose. And then I just do stop motion for the hose turning on, you know, the faucet. That's why
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:19.020]   I gave her special powers so that, and it made the story better. So sometimes the limitations you have
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.060]   with equipment or location, you can use it to make, you know, take chicken shit, turn it in chicken
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:30.080]   salad. Take this camera that everyone was like, what's this? And I go, I can do so much with this.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.560]   But I tell you today, I look at that camera. I can't believe I ever made a movie with that thing.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.280]   It's so ridiculously primitive. I was like, how did I even think I could get anything done with this?
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.480]   And it even exposed and mariachi the same way you have to think about it. I shot mariachi on film
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.160]   and with a bar 16 millimeter camera, I didn't know how to use it. I called up a place in Dallas that
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.760]   rented that kind of equipment. And I said, I have an airy 16 S here.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:04.020]   Two motor looking things. One has a 24 on one has a bunch of numbers. Oh, that's a variable speed
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:08.100]   motor. That means you can do different speed. I can shoot slow motion with this. Oh, wow. Do you
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.960]   have a torque motor? I don't know. What is that? Is there something on the side of the magazine?
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.260]   Like it does. Yeah. Now you can just look up on YouTube and it shows you how to do it. I was doing
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.520]   it by phone that way. And then I went and shot the movie right then. Yeah.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:27.660]   And I didn't know if any of it was exposing or if the film camera was working until I finished the
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:32.360]   whole movie. So imagine you have to go down to Mexico, shoot for two weeks, come back, send
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:39.080]   it off to a lab. You want to talk about being nervous, just hoping something exposed. And
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.520]   when I saw it come back and the tape, you know, they transferred it to a tape so I could edit
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.880]   it deck to deck again. I was so relieved. Some things didn't come out, but I can cut around
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.840]   that. It's like, Oh yeah. Cause I'm doing everything. Like right here, you're doing
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.960]   everything. Imagine if you forgot to stop down and it's open all the way and one shot is blown out.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   You know, I'd have stuff like that because I'm moving fast and I'm doing it.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.260]   Wait a minute. You shot, I'm going to actually, the whole thing without knowing if some of the
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:10.020]   footage is damaged wrong without any of it. That's why I only did one take. So my idea was this.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.940]   How gangster is that? Wow. It was a test film.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.660]   Right. Right. I thought it was, I thought it was going to be a test film. Yeah. It's the only movie
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:25.560]   in history ever made where the filmmaker did not think anyone would see it and expect it and even
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.620]   set it up that way. I mean, why would I make an action movie for the Spanish market called basically
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:34.400]   the guitar player promises? No action. No one's going to watch it. But I thought if someone actually
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.800]   picks it up and has the balls to watch this thing, they're going to be surprised. I put a lot of
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.360]   action. It was just to learn from, I just needed to make it for as little as possible,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.400]   see how much I could sell it for. If I could double my money. Great. I can make another one and just
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.600]   get more practice. It was just, I was so intrigued by this idea because you've heard advice about
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:57.080]   screenwriting. I heard advice back then that I thought was ridiculous. It said, it's going to take
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.060]   you a long time to be a good screenwriter. So write three scripts and throw them away. The fourth script
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:06.460]   will be the good one. I was like, it's so hard to write a script. Who's going to write three full
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.840]   scripts? No one, they throw them away. Wouldn't it be better if you write three scripts and then
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.480]   shoot each one and be the cameraman, be the sound guy, be everything. Cause that way you're learning,
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.880]   not just writing, you're learning how to make a movie. So that was my idea. I'm going to make three
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.180]   of these, hide it on Spanish video, but make money back. That's like my own film school paying me,
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:32.580]   paying me to learn. So the first one I thought, let me just shoot it. One take each, because my friend
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.560]   Carlos lives in Mexico, if we shoot two takes, most of the cost is to film. I've just doubled
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.060]   my budget. So let me just shoot one take. Some of it's going to not come out, but I'm not going
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.260]   to know what, I'm not going to shoot a safety one. That doubles my, let me, let me see. Some things
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:52.040]   might come out. I expected like 70% of it to maybe be okay, but 30% I might have to come reshoot,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.740]   which is fine. I just drive back there. And then I just reshoot just those shots. Right?
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:02.120]   So I just went, let's shoot. We stop, we come back. Then I send it off to develop
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:07.920]   because we're shooting two weeks consecutively to get film shipped back and forth from Mexico to see
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.400]   if it came out. You just couldn't do it. I just had to, you know, double down on it, do it one take,
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.880]   everything. I remember one time I was still an actor, man, I told you to run through that shot.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.540]   He goes, oh, let me do it. No, one take, dude. Just think about next time. Do what I say.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.360]   I didn't think anyone was going to see it. So you, and because you don't think anyone's going to see
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.100]   it, you end up doing something remarkable, which is, well, I'm just going to make something for myself.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.440]   Because if I was making a movie that was going to go to Sundance, I wouldn't have made that movie.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.500]   I would have thought, okay, I got to get serious. But because I made this movie that was just
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:44.860]   entertaining myself like bedhead, it entertained audiences. So that naivete is really important when
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.700]   you're starting out or at any point in your life, be naive about what things are going to,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.720]   and just do something for yourself. That taught me a very valuable lesson because I didn't want
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.080]   anybody to see it. I just thought one take, one take. When I got back home, a bunch of stuff didn't
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.860]   come out, but I'm like, I'm not going back to Mexico. I'll figure out a way to edit around it
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:08.240]   and make the movie shorter. And that's just going to be the movie. And then that's the one that won
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.540]   Sundance. That was your first feature film. That's the one you made for $7,000. You mentioned
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:19.200]   your Frank Carlos as the star of the movie, everything one take. And I highly recommend
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.920]   people go back and watch that movie. It's just an incredible movie. It's fun. And it's an action
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.040]   film, moves really fast. The story is really interesting. So the script is really interesting.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.140]   All the actors, you could tell, they all kind of stepped up and played their own roles.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.820]   They weren't actors.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:40.920]   That's right. They were just friends of ours, which is why, and because, and this was the magic
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:46.040]   of not having a crew. They didn't feel like they were making a movie. It's like this, you know,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:54.840]   we're just here. Me with my one camera. In fact, the gal, Carl said, this one girl, I forgot she's in
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.500]   town. Maybe she would work. Cause we tried to get a soap star and she backed out. So we got this gal
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.120]   over and she goes, but I don't know how to act. And I said, here, let's watch. I want to show you
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.820]   some on Mexican TV. A telenovela was on and you see someone, you know, all over, over acting. I said,
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.120]   that's acting. I don't want you to do that. I want you to just talk like you're talking about it.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.400]   Wait, that the love interest, the woman in that, that's what you're talking about. That's what
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.920]   you're talking about. She's amazing. She's amazing. But cause I got a video of her. I said, I want you
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.780]   to just do this one line. Pretend like you're just talking to your boyfriend. Yeah. And I showed her,
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.940]   I showed her the video. That was cool. Cause I couldn't show her the film because we'd have to
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.340]   develop it. But I showed her a video test of herself doing it. And she saw herself doing it.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:39.300]   She suddenly had the confidence. We went through her closet, this red dress you can wear in that.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.480]   And everyone just brought their own clothes. She really had like a sexuality,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.500]   a tension, like a romantic tension that was real. That was, it was an issue. It was a,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.760]   it was, it was in part a great love story that, I mean, it's as ridiculous as it is to say.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.780]   And in part like a dramatic love story. Yeah. The idea was that, you know, I thought a guitar
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.340]   player, you know, originally what I wanted to do was like road warrior. I said, I want a guy with a
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:05.460]   guitar case full of weapons going from town to town, like road warrior, but that don't have enough
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.600]   money for the first one to do that. That'll be the second movie I do. How about we do a Genesis story,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:16.780]   how he became that guy. So let's do Mad Max basically how he becomes that guy. So maybe he is a guitar
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:22.380]   player so that you start writing it out. I'm going to show you my writing method. I write on, on index
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:29.180]   cards and I carry one of these, a little packet of index cards. I keep one always in my bag and I smile
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.900]   when I run across it. Cause I go, I've made a million dollars with one of these before. You know,
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:40.440]   it's like, this is the key to your next success cards. Cause you know, when you go see a therapist,
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:45.120]   you're not going to them for the answers. You're going to them for the questions. You got the answers
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.740]   inside, which you don't have are the questions. A lot of times we ask ourselves very unempowering
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.460]   questions. Like, why am I such a loser? You know, I can think of 10 answers right now,
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.440]   but if you could, but if you go, what three things can I do today that'll not just change my life,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.860]   but everyone around me take steps to that, take out your cards and start writing them down.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:08.040]   You won't come up with three. You'll come up with 15. I'm like, wow. Cause you're asking yourself
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.440]   and you'll see him. So when I was doing that movie, I thought, okay, he's a guitar player for real.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:20.020]   And he gets mixed up with the guy with a case. So how about he walks into a bar. So right down there,
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:26.440]   he walks into a bar, bar, trying to get work. Bartender looks at him. We don't hire Maria.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.440]   I should just get the hell out of here. So he leaves after that whole scene, explaining who
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.640]   he is and what his story is. Then the shooter comes in with a guitar case full of weapons.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.520]   He's also dressed in black and he shoots the place up. Now that was a short film. That's
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.760]   how you'd start a short film, but this is a feature movie. So shit, I got to figure out how
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:51.140]   to tell a feature. I'm going to need a few more cards before that. So I'm going to need, well,
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:56.260]   who's this bad guy? How about he's in jail? I'd read a story. It's a crazy story about a guy
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.080]   who was in jail in Mexico and he was running his drug business from the jail as protection.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:05.680]   He can walk out anytime, but it was to have the cops be his enforcers basically. So introduce
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.200]   that guy. He's in jail making phone calls and someone puts a hit on him. So we have action
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.980]   right away. There's a hit on him. He kills those guys cause it's his operation. He's not
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.880]   in jail. All the cops are working for him. And he tells that guy on the phone, the main bad
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.060]   guy, I'm going to come to town. I'm going to kill all your guys and I'm going to come
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:31.820]   kill you. So then he gets in his truck and you see them bring him a guitar case full of
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:39.840]   weapons. He passes the mariachi on the way to town. And now it's his story. The baton gets
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.700]   turned to mariachi. Mariachi is doing a voiceover. It's easy to shoot. We can do the voice later.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:50.280]   We don't have to sing sound. There was even a scene when he walks into town where we saw these
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.220]   coconuts, a guy cutting coconuts and we go, Oh, let's go film over there. So we filmed the guy
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.780]   giving him a coconut with a straw in it. And he walks out and went, shit, man, you forgot to pay
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:03.620]   the guy. Well, let's shoot that. No, there's one take. I'll just put in the voiceover that they give
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.820]   away free coconuts in this town. And for years, people in other countries would go, they really
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.640]   give away free coconuts? No, it's because we forgot to show him paying, you know, little happy
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.580]   accidents. So now look, you're already building a movie. So it's like, now he goes in the bar.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:20.240]   Now he's mixed up. And the bad guy says, find the guy with a guitar case full of weapons.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:26.620]   Then he goes and meets the girl. So you just start your movie. Visually, you can start seeing your
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.960]   movie. And I've used this for business things. I've used this for ideas, for manifesting stuff.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.880]   It's brilliant. Are you doing this alone? Usually, are you brainstorming?
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.560]   It's coming and it comes so fast. It's like free association. Maybe I have the ending. Oh,
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:43.920]   I know I want his hand shot. He's going to get his hand shot because he's a musician and
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.840]   those ballads are always really tragic. So the girl has to die. The girl has to die because
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:56.320]   if it's going to be a tragic song for a songbook, each movie should be like a tragedy. That's
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.400]   going to be over here. You know, now you got the ending and then your brain starts filling
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:05.460]   in the rest because you're asking yourself these prompt questions that you already have answers
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:10.020]   for from a past life, from a vision you had that you don't even know are there. This prompts
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.900]   it. It's kind of a puzzle that you're figuring out. What happens if you get stuck? Like this
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.920]   doesn't make sense. Like some aspect of the structure doesn't make sense.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.100]   Just leave it all there. You won't. Yeah. You just start, you just start writing in the ones
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:27.320]   you do know. Yeah. Like, okay. I know, I know at some point she's going to betray him or he's
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   going to think she does. She betrays him. Okay. That's in the middle somewhere. Uh, the other
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.880]   ones will come. Yeah. Those are all like crossroads for the story. Doesn't that like,
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.060]   how do you know she has to die? Can I, can you change your mind about that?
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:46.000]   I can. Yeah. But for now I felt like if I really want the stories telling me now what it is,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.260]   I didn't know I was going to make a Genesis story. I wanted to do the road warrior guy,
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:55.240]   but the road warrior, he lost his family. So really to propel him to become a guy who has a guitar
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:02.060]   case full of weapons, he has to lose everything. So he needs a ghost. So this is a Genesis story of a
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.820]   character. Well, look, Bruce Wayne lost his parents. You could say, well, does the parents
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.040]   have to die? Well, no, but it's not going to propel him. Like it's not going to, it's not
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   going to drive him like that thing. So it just kept, it's just coming to me. So this is my other trick.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.080]   And this is the main thing you got to learn about that. If you take any away, this isn't me doing it.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:25.160]   I totally believe that because when you start doing this, you go, where are these answers coming from?
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.120]   I'm asking the right question, but why, how come the answers just keep coming like this?
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.340]   I believe, cause I do so many different jobs. I've learned this over the years. When I was in
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:42.720]   2002, I was like, how is it that I'm the production designer, the composer, which I don't even know
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.700]   how to read or write music. And I'm writing orchestral score and I'm doing the editing and I'm doing the
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.280]   cinematography. I haven't been trained for any of these. I never went to school for these specifically.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:45:00.240]   Must be something about creativity. So I went on Amazon. It's 2002. I look up creative books,
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.580]   anything that has creativity in the title. I just ordered it. And I've got a bunch of books on
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:11.060]   creativity and I was reading them through. One of them was like really speaking to me. Yeah, that's,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:16.080]   that's it. That's the process. And then it says gels and mediums. And I'm like, oh, this is a book
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.520]   specifically about painting, but it applies to music, editing, cinematography, writing.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:29.640]   It's all the same. So that's when I realized that creativity is 90% of any of those jobs,
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:36.940]   the technical part of setting up the cameras of writing a script in format or reading or writing
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.060]   music. That's 10% of that. How many musicians, you know, don't read or write music and they're
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:47.740]   fantastic because 90% what they do is creative. Now I believe that that same person, even if they only
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:54.720]   do music could literally jump from job to job creatively and do a superior job than most technicians.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.220]   And there's also something to say there about the learning, the technical aspects of an art,
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:08.960]   you, you collide with the, uh, uh, with the experts. What, what happens is I've experienced this a lot
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.260]   with like, with, with using cameras and so on. I don't know shit about cameras and that you roll in
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:18.440]   and then there's all the experts almost talking down to you and telling you how things are supposed
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.960]   to be. Everything is wrong. I talked to somebody about like soundproofing a room and they said,
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.700]   they gave me prices. They're insane. And like the amount of effort is insane. And this,
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:34.060]   the, the, the, the dynamics of this room are all wrong. I'm like, why can't I just fucking hang up
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.820]   some curtains? Like what? It seems like that kills most of the echo. Like, I don't, I don't understand.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.780]   And they're like, no, this is all wrong. There's corn, the corners are going to have some,
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.420]   and I'm like, fuck it. I'm just going to try and I see what it sounds like a and B. Okay. Here's
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:52.040]   audio with curtains. Here's the audio without curtains. It seems like this is fine as a move on to the
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:59.660]   next thing. I think that when you say creativity, some of that is being a rebel, like not listening
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.620]   to the experts. Yeah. Well, you're going on your creativity, which is what is that? That's like an,
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.040]   do you consider yourself a creative person? I think you play guitar. Yeah. Guitar, piano. Yeah.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.900]   You play piano. Okay. Do you could, but would you call yourself a creative person?
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.920]   Yeah, I think so. Good. I think that's a positive. I would just suggest to anybody is just own it,
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.740]   own it. And just say, I like when I do so many different jobs, it sounds crazy when they would
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.960]   introduce me, Hey, Robert, he does this blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I was like,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.420]   I get tired of just hearing that list. But when I think about it, there's really only one thing I do
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.480]   and I live a creative life. And when you live a creative life, I mean, anything that has to do with
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.860]   creativity, whether it's filming or piano or guitar or sculpting, or you can just, you can do it.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.060]   You can take it on and do it because it teaches you more about your main job. I become a better
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:47.640]   director by doing all those jobs. Cause when somebody just does one job, they barely know
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:52.820]   that job. You have to do more to learn about creativity. And this is the main thing I learned
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:58.140]   was that I'm writing music, you know, for an orchestra. I'm like, how did I, I don't even
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.720]   know what I'm doing. Why is that coming out? I don't feel like I'm doing it. I feel like I picked
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:08.040]   up the pen. I feel like I had the idea to do the cards, but then when everything just starts
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.920]   coming out so quickly, like that's how fast I wrote that movie. I go, I really feel like
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:18.740]   something else has taken over. So this is what my belief is. And cause I hear it in different
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.440]   realms. Like you asked Keith Richards, how do you come up with these riffs? He goes, I don't,
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.680]   I don't. They're floating around the sky and I pull them out first. You know, yes. I asked,
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.220]   you know, Jimmy Vaughn, how do you play guitar? Those solos. He goes, it's like a radio. You know,
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.120]   once you get a tune just right, you can't even believe what's coming through. So I believe,
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.000]   I call it the creative spirit. There's a spirit assigned to all of us. It's creative
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.340]   that doesn't have hands. It needs you to pick up the pen, pull out the cards. And then when you start
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:48.660]   getting in the flow and you're like, Whoa, it's writing. It's that's that. And if you can have
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:53.940]   that mindset, you take your ego out of it and go, all I need to do is to be a good conduit for this
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.700]   thing, be a good pipe. And it's going to come through. So you don't ever have to get hung up on
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.660]   that question you had. Well, well, what happens when you can't come up? It wasn't me to begin with.
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:09.880]   If it's not coming out, it's because I'm blocking it. And if I were to do this and I'm flowing and if
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:15.540]   I were to say, wow, I just wrote 10 cards. I don't know if I can write more. How did I do that? You just
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:20.140]   shut the pipe because your ego got in the way. You just clogged it because it gets pissed off that you
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.520]   think it's you. It's not you. It's like, dude, just open up. Let me through, pick up the fucking pen.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.900]   And I learned this in, uh, when I was 19, when I had a daily cartoon strip, I had to draw a comic
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:37.400]   strip every day to get paid. And I would be like, I'd have to draw like one drawing, draw another
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.100]   drawing. Then it's like, okay, these kind of go together. It was a process, you know? And sometimes
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:47.260]   I just felt like, I wish I could just envision it, sit back. I'm going to try that method. I went home
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.060]   and I would sit back and just try to get in my sofa, try the sofa method. I'm just going to try a picture
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:55.300]   of the comic strip. And then as soon as I got one, I think it's funny. Then I'll just go draw that.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:00.700]   Right. Doesn't be done in a half hour. Why, why, why it's three hours? I'd sit there and sit there and
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.760]   sit there. My deadline would be coming up. Got like 30 minutes. I'm like, oh shit. Got to go sit and draw
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:08.560]   it out. And it's like, oh, okay. I got this drawing. It's kind of, oh, this kind of goes with that. If I
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.120]   make another drawing, I have my strip. That's the only way to do it. If you don't get up, the creative
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:19.860]   spirit ain't going to come visit you if you're doing this. Yeah. It needs your hands and it's not going to
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:25.060]   reward you for sitting there, wait for it. You have to jump in and do it. And people, when they
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:30.980]   say, oh, well, I'm not ready. How pissed off is that spirit now? It's waiting for you to feel like
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:36.340]   you're ready. It's not you just start doing the action and it's going to come through and the ideas
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.540]   will come and the answers will come because it's not you. And if you can take your ego out of life,
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:45.880]   you'll be blessed with this never ending flow of ideas because don't take ownership for it and know
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.860]   that you're, if it's not coming out, it's because you're just clogging it because this thing's got
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:55.740]   endless ideas. And you give that same advice for making films, which is, you know, don't plan. If you
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.860]   want to be a filmmaker, don't plan like the movie, don't think about making the movie, just go in and
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:04.660]   start. Yeah. I would meet a lot of people who introduce themselves as aspiring. I'm an aspiring
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.640]   filmmaker and I wonder how, what would you tell an aspiring filmmaker? I'd say, stop aspiring.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:14.060]   Because if you, if you call yourself that you are that, and you're always going to feel like
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:18.240]   you're not ready and you don't, you just jump in before you're ready. You don't feel like you're
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.120]   ready till I didn't feel like I was ready to do mariachi till I was probably in my last few days of
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.000]   filming. You became ready as you went. You didn't know all that stuff. I couldn't have figured all
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.320]   that out in advance. When my kids worked with me on a project that we did similar by the end,
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.580]   they realized they did an interview with my son who after just two weeks of doing one of those
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:40.840]   projects, you're a different person. He's suddenly waxing philosophical about the creative process and
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.860]   going, I never knew how my dad did mariachi until we did this project together. And I realized he
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:49.420]   didn't know either. He didn't know I was going to do it. He figured it out day by day. Every challenge
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:55.640]   that got thrown at him, he had to figure it out. And that's the biggest lesson. Most people never start.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   And that's the biggest thing. Don't wait till you're ready or they'll be on your tombstone.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:03.860]   Here lies so-and-so. He was never ready. And you don't want to be that guy. Jump in. No,
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:09.060]   it's not you. You just got to be the hands. And that relieves a lot of pressure from you
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:13.120]   because then you don't have to ever have to do anything, really. You just have to be the hands.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.640]   Can you talk through some of the hats, some of the many hats you wore with the El Mariachi? That's an
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.560]   interesting case study. And you've done the same thing over and over in completely different,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.880]   innovative ways in all the films. But El Mariachi is such a radical leap for you.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.940]   That was crazy. That thing's held together with Scotch tape and rubber bands because of the camera I
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:38.300]   borrowed. You directed, you did cinematography, you did the sound.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:43.040]   It's better to just say what I didn't do. I didn't act in front of the camera. Everything else I did.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:49.240]   Everything else, I was the whole crew. It's just like you're doing here, except you've got sound
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.680]   recording right onto the cameras, right? Or do you have it to the system?
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.820]   Separately, but it's synced. I mean, all the modern technology.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.900]   But it's synced, yeah. So I didn't have sync camera.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.240]   Yep.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:05.700]   So I had a camera that, it was not a sync camera. And the thing was, it was so loud,
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.320]   I would have had to blimp the shit out of it, which I didn't have a blimp. And then I would
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.140]   have needed a sound guy.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.160]   Just to be clear, so if people don't understand this, you're shooting basically no sound.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.060]   Because the camera sounds like this.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:22.460]   It's like, it sounds like all your money's going away, first of all. So I would go like this.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.460]   Action. You'd start running.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.560]   And I shoot my edit.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.200]   Cut.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.120]   Yep.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.020]   You know, they're still running, you know, like I'm only using this part. And there's no slates.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.660]   There's no, there's, there's guys holding up their fingers at the beginning of rolling. This
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:43.660]   is real seven for just a few frames. I know which real it is. And then that 10 minutes of film
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:50.260]   is just one shot after another. And I use almost every frame of those shots because I was cutting
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:55.040]   in the camera. Now, after I shoot, like, let's say, you know, tell me your name.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:55.900]   Lex.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.140]   What's your last name?
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.020]   Friedman.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.000]   Where do you live?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.680]   Austin, Texas.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.320]   I would do the whole scene. Then I'll get the sound, bring the mic in close like that. Say it again.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:05.980]   Lex.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   Friedman, Austin, Texas.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:14.440]   That'll probably sink. Now, if you were going on and on, there's a place where it'd go out
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:21.900]   of sync. I hate rubbery lips. So I would cut away to the dog or to the knife or to the girl. And then
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:26.100]   I cut back when you're back in sync. And since these were non-actors, they say everything the
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.740]   same way each time. They would say their line just like they weren't, they weren't performing it to
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.080]   where they didn't remember how they performed the thing before. They were just talking in their
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.860]   own rhythm. So a lot of the times it's the, anytime you see anyone on camera talking,
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:41.280]   they're in sync with themselves. And as soon as it cuts away, they're out of sync.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.900]   And it created this really fast cutting style that I probably wouldn't have had on such a low budget
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.340]   movie, but it was the only way to keep things in sync. So when I would shoot two people talking,
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:54.600]   I would make sure I'd film a couple of shots of like the dog or a stuffed cat or something,
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.840]   just so I'd have something to cut away to, to get them back in sync.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.620]   That's so brilliant.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:01.860]   And it's, I call it, it's just resourceful. It's just being very resourceful.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.480]   And you allow it to get maybe a little bit out of sync sometimes?
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.180]   I didn't allow it, but I, oh yeah, I would let it, if I just didn't have a way to cut away.
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:08.500]   Right.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.480]   And I would try to sync it as best I could.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.300]   But we as the audience, like, do you understand where the threshold is?
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.920]   Where we notice something?
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.920]   It seems like you can get away with a lot.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.480]   You can get away with, I just don't, I'm just particular about that.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:26.740]   I just don't like seeing a dub movie where it just feels canned. It makes you not believe in it
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:32.320]   anymore. So I just cut away where the lips are just way off. I just didn't want any of that.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:38.400]   I just felt like I wanted it to just be believable and there, they could be really believable if
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.120]   they were in sync, but I didn't shoot two takes of film or even two takes of audio, but just one
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.980]   take. We just went to the, and what's cool is that because I just had them go through the whole scene
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.740]   again. So I would go ahead and record them, like grabbing the bottle or any action they did opening
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.800]   the suitcase. I have all the sound effects too. I just had to sync it by hand. That's a lot of work
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:02.980]   for me, but I got great sound that way. Cause if I had had a sync camera, the mic would have been so
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:08.520]   far. We wouldn't have, we would have had to go get new sound effects, but because the camera's off,
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.740]   I could record everything close up. So there was some blessing to that.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:16.380]   You, uh, and Quentin Tarantino had a great conversation about a lot of topics, but one of
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.520]   them is how to bring out the best in the actors. Like what in that El Mariachi, how do you bring
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:27.060]   out the best in these non-actors? And then maybe what's the thread that connects to your future
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:27.540]   work too?
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:33.360]   What really helped for those non-actors was that they just look across and it's me filming.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.100]   They didn't feel like they're, so they're being so natural. And I think I, who played the bad
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:41.720]   guy, I met him in the research hospital where I was sold my body to science. He was my bunkmate.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.280]   And I said, dude, you look kind of like Rudger Hauer. And then it's like, we saw another movie,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.440]   man, you look like James Spader. Shit. You should be the bad guy in my movie. And it'd be cool to have
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.760]   you as the bad guy. He goes, but I don't speak Spanish. Well, that's okay. All right. And I'll
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.300]   teach you phonetically. And you're going to wear sunglasses. And if you look close, he's holding the,
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.520]   he's holding the lines here. And he's looking at the lines like that and just smiling.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.740]   So can't believe he's getting away with this. He's smiling and he's got the sunglasses on.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.760]   I read that somewhere in the pool. There's like a scene in the pool.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.860]   In the pool. He's like this.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.560]   With the sunglasses on. Oh man.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.220]   But he was doing it phonetically. And I tell you what, he was so great. That guy, right?
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.960]   When we do Desperado, I brought him back. Didn't even have to do any dialogue. Watch that movie.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.600]   When he shows up in the opening scene, when Desperado, he's playing the guitar and the opening
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.640]   with the credits to tie it into the first movie, he shows up again. And all he has to do is light a
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:38.720]   cigarette. And you see this. He's so nervous because now there's a crew behind me. Now it's
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:44.100]   real. Before it was just me and him and it didn't feel like a real movie. So everyone gave a great
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:50.520]   performance. So how do you recreate that later on a big movie is just building a report, making a safe
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.160]   zone for your actors. Quentin once told me, sometimes being, you know, we're talking about
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:57.760]   directing is sometimes being a great director, just being a great audience, you know, being a great
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.180]   audience for them. Cause you're, you're the, you're taking the place of the audience for the
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:05.180]   actor. They try something. And if you're enjoying it, they know that the audience is going to enjoy
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:10.040]   it. Or if you're, you know, makes you cry, you know, so sometimes you just, you don't have to tell
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:15.080]   them a lot sometimes. And if you do have something very specific to tell them, they usually, you know,
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:20.440]   go with it. But I always just like to see what they do. And a lot of times they just are in the zone
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.680]   because again, they're, they're getting that flow too. You create the right environment.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:28.480]   Everyone's getting this inspiration that's all tied together that you never could have directed.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:33.320]   It's just like, you just create that space where we're all going to be open to it and it's going
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:38.160]   to drop in our lap. And I'm going to point it out when it does, because you may not feel like you know
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.620]   how to play this role yet, but I say not knowing is the other half of the battle and the more important
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.420]   part, that's the part we're going to discover. And when it happens, I'm going to point it out and it's
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.820]   going to be like magic and we're just going to go, okay, we're accepting it and we do it. And it gets
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:55.440]   people in that kind of headspace. And then we're all open to it, to where the character is supposed
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:00.260]   to go, what the, what it's supposed to sound like, instead of me being very, you know, manipulative
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.980]   to get a certain thing. I don't know. It's, it's just whenever it feels good.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.460]   Yeah. There's such an intimate connection between the actor and the director. I've seen some of the
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:11.180]   behind the scenes footage with you. You are just a fan enjoying the scene when it's done well.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.240]   But I think there's an aspect, if I were to put myself in the headspace of the actor,
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:20.380]   they want you as the audience, like to earn that happiness, you know, because when a director
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.020]   approves.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.020]   Yeah. Well, you're a performer and you want, and there's no other, you know, it's not like a live
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.380]   show where you get the approval of the audience and you're like, oh, wow, they, they liked that joke.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:32.860]   Let me do more. You know, really the director is it. And a lot of times the director's way behind a
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.060]   monitor somewhere. That's why I still like to operate the camera. Cause when I'm operating the camera,
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:41.040]   it's like this, we can have a hundred people here. We wouldn't know because they go away. It's just us.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.440]   They just disappear when it's the camera guy is the director. And we're going, let's do that again.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.400]   Let's do that again. There's a shot. And, uh, I'm lighting sensitivity myself. There's a bad,
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.780]   my crew setting lights and I have, uh, this great shot of Clive Owen where he's holding down Benicio's
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:59.980]   head in the toilet. You know, Benicio's not there. It's just a closeup of him at this point. And I'm
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:04.340]   practicing my shot. I'm zooming in slow in his face and people are still walking behind him on the
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.160]   green screen setting lights. And I'm like, I'm rolling. We're ready to go. We're getting this. I can already
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.440]   tell we're already in the moment what you're doing right now. Just keep holding that. Look
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.720]   now one jolt. Like you're like, he's starting to fight back, but you don't even flinch cut. Okay.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.040]   Nevermind. You guys can stop moving. That's true. We already got. Holy shit.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.400]   Wow. Yeah. It's like that. Cause you're so lucky. That's a great scene by the way.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.580]   Great. Right. And it was, if I wait for these guys, this moment will be gone.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:33.820]   And then another one was Mickey Rourke. You know, he had so much freaking dialogue. He had just done
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:38.260]   this whole big dialogue scene. He had another one that said, let's go ahead and start with a wide
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:44.080]   shot where the two actors, if I'm the camera, you know, Mickey and Elijah are here, let's get a two
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.820]   shot and we'll come around on Mickey closeup. We don't, we'll turn Mickey around for the closeup.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.420]   Let's start with the wide thing. Get used to the lines. And most of it's going to be sold in a
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:56.720]   closeup. We sit down, Mickey starts delivering the take. I'm like, hold on, hold a second. I brought
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.120]   my camera over, zoom in, just adjust that light real quick. Cause I'm the DP. Cause if I had another
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.460]   director of photography, they'd be like, oh no, no, we have to relight and all this stuff. It's like,
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:09.520]   no, no, let's just do this. This let's go. He's doing it right now. And I go, and that performance is
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:16.840]   just right then. And so you can feel that when you're also you're operating and you're the camera guy and
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.240]   you're the DP it's like high tech guerrilla filmmaking. Yeah. I run a green screen, but it's
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:27.520]   like all the crew needs are, you know, marching orders. Just put a light back there, hitting them
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.920]   harder. Like that's a, this is a 5k, make that a 10k. It's got to be stronger. They don't need to
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.040]   know that I'm going to make that a lamppost later. They just need it marching orders for the moment.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.760]   So I can just kind of tell people do this, do this, do that. And then I know what I can accomplish
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.000]   with the actor. And then everything else falls into place later. Cause I'm going to put all that in
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.620]   later. You know, things, once you know how to do a lot of jobs like that, you can just move at the
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:53.000]   speed of thought, which is where the actors love being creatively because they, nobody knew what
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.140]   green screen was back then. They're like, what is this again? So I explained it as well, it's kind
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:01.520]   of like doing theater, but instead of a black curtain behind you with a prop, it'll be a green
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.180]   curtain. And you might just have a cup or just a steering wheel, but it's just you and the other
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.800]   actors just like this and everything else will be painted in later. We're just talking.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.760]   We're locked in. If we stay locked in, we'll look great when there's rain coming down and we're on a
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.660]   ship later, but it's comes down to this. Right. And the more it was so fun to do those kinds of movies
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.920]   to this day, you try to be close to the action connected with the actor. That's because it's like
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:32.840]   a dance. You end up. That's so like to hear a member on dust till dawn, Michael parks in the opening
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.580]   scene. He's talking about the two guys that are running around killing people just before he gets
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:43.900]   shot. And there's a, I just start doing this slow zoom. I remember it was take eight, start doing the
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:50.040]   slow zoom on him. And I'm like, I hope I get all the way up to where it stops zooming when he finishes
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.960]   that speech. Cause there's no set way. And I don't know how he's going to say it, but you're just locked
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.000]   almost telepathically. And as he's delivered, there's no edits. He's just going, yeah, they killed four
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.320]   rangers, two hostages. It's just like, wow. And you're just so pulled in. I'm just like, oh my God.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.360]   And then it stopped. It's like, I ran out of zoom, right. As he finished that speech.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.700]   So how can a director, cause there's a lot of great directors that stay in the,
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:18.820]   in the back of the battlefield. You know, they just trust that whatever they get from their crew,
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.400]   they just, you accept it. Just like, you know, you would get a take to them.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:27.320]   There's so much. I like, I like that intimate connection because I could not be behind a monitor.
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.780]   Even if I had communication with my cameraman, okay, now start zooming in. You're not going to
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.820]   know. You have to feel it. You have to be in there. It's like a dance. It's like trying to do a dance
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:40.140]   with a partner and you're across the room. You know, it's like, no, you got to be there up close
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.560]   feeling the energy. And it's the creative spirits whispering to your both. You know, it's not your
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.580]   own idea. It's you're capturing a moment. That's magic. And there's true magic that happens on a set.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:56.600]   And that's what brings you back. Cause you know, I didn't direct that and they didn't act that that
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.000]   came through us. And we just had the cameras rolling and we captured a ghost.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.840]   It's like you said, don't you have the pen in hand and you were, you were there.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.360]   It's like that. It's crazy.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:05.880]   It's crazy.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.740]   All right. Your friendship with Tarantino is just fascinating. And just the whole timeline of the
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.580]   history of movies and the two of you collided and met is, is just a fascinating part of the story.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.680]   You first met him in 1992 at the Toronto Film Festival. Can you just talk about meeting
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.220]   Tarantino?
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:30.720]   We both had films at the same time with first films, guys in black, action, violence. In fact,
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.520]   I had seen this movie already. My first film festival was a few months before that, the
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.720]   Telluride Film Festival and Reservoir Dogs was there, but Quentin couldn't be there. He was at
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.360]   Sundance earlier that year. And the guy who became my agent, he saw it and said, Hey, you're going to
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.460]   like this guy, Quentin Tarantino. I told him about you. You're going to meet him. He's going to be in
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:49.500]   Toronto. Oh, cool. Cool. Okay. And so I went ahead and saw his movie and Telluride. And I was like,
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:55.100]   Holy shit, this guy's in black again, just like the mariachis dressed in black and action. And I said,
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.920]   Oh, we're going to like each other. He's going to like my movie. So then in Toronto, we met and we met
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.660]   first on a, cause I knew I was going to be doing a panel discussion with him. They asked us to do a
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.700]   panel discussion about violence and movies in the nineties, even though it was only 92.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.660]   So we're on a panel together and that's where I met him. And he's like, Hey, Robert, your agent told me
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.520]   about you. And I was like, yeah, I saw your movie Reservoir Dogs. And he goes, Oh, you got to come to my
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.100]   screening and I'm going to come see yours. So he came to mariachi and I videotaped the audience reactions
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:31.920]   because they were insane, insane reactions to it. But I have the first screening. He saw mariachi sitting
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:37.440]   next to me laughing. He's laughing at everything. He was just the best audience. I have his recording of the
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:42.480]   first time he saw mariachi. Oh no, really? Yeah. Cause I taped it. He's so loud. Cause he's right
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:49.160]   next to me. Well, just like you, but even probably even more than you. He's a fan. He watches, he just
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:55.600]   loves movies. He loves movies. In fact, I, the next time I heard him laugh that way, was it that his own
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.680]   premiere for Kill Bill? We're watching Kill Bill and he's laughing like it's somebody else's movie. He still
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.700]   enjoys the movies. It's so he loves, but all the actors did. And it's like, that's the kind of energy
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:10.940]   you really love. But I'll tell you what, what, what happened. Um, I'm not a very shy person, you know,
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:15.480]   very shy. I'd have to go talk. I'm sure you probably feel like you're not an orator or anything, you know,
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:20.080]   just have to go do it. I thought, well, man, I'm gonna have to introduce my film and talk about it
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.320]   afterwards. I'm afraid of that. What am I going to do? I don't, I've never talked in front of more than five people
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:31.200]   before. So I went to see this other movie and it was good. And I was watching and then the director
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.540]   comes up at the end and goes, yeah, well, that was my movie. And, um, you know, uh, you know,
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.900]   here's the writer. And it's like, oh man, I don't like the movie anymore. This guy's kind of a dick.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:48.360]   So I cannot do that. I'm going to have to go be who they imagined made that movie. So I wrote out my
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.100]   whole intro. It was like a 20 minute intro because no one had ever heard of anybody making
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.840]   a movie for no money, much less without a crew, much less, you know, the way I did it was just
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:06.440]   very new. Nobody knew it was possible. So my whole intro is like, you'll see the Columbia logo slapped
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.080]   in front. It's probably cost more than the whole movie. And then I go through, this is how I made it
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.100]   with a wheelchair for a dolly, a turtle. You know, I wrote around things I had. I mentioned the turtle,
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:20.620]   the pit bull, the bus, the ranch, all that stuff. Right. So then when they see the movie,
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:25.860]   in fact, I think my wife was in the audience, she said at Sundance, people were laughing so much at
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:29.740]   your intro. They just wanted to hear a story like this so badly. I heard someone next to me say,
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:34.200]   I'm going to vote for his movie. They hadn't even seen the movie just because the story was so good.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:40.980]   They wanted that movie to be great. And when they see the turtle, big cheers. When they see the pit
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.720]   bull, big cheers. When they see the school bus cheers. But then when they see how we use it,
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   he slams into it and falls in it, they fricking lose their minds because they know how I put it
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.840]   together. They know that the rubber bands and the popsicle sticks, I already set it up.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.820]   And so that's why that audience, I would just hate the reaction. They're so with it.
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:06.760]   The context is so key. Like you can watch Mariachi and go, Hey, yeah, this looks like a 7,000 on a movie.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.260]   But if you know the story behind it, suddenly I was curious. I hadn't seen it in a long time. I was
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:16.240]   watching it for the 20th anniversary. We did a screening and the first few shots come up and I'm
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.580]   like, Oh yeah, well, it looks like a $7,000 movie. And then it just keeps going. And it's in the,
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:24.800]   once we're in the jail cell and the shooting's happening and I realized, Oh my God, we had these
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:33.700]   blanks that only fired one shot and it would jam. So I had to show it going, use the sound effect,
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:38.060]   cut to the other guy, cut back to have another one go. I had to do these editing tricks to make it look
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:42.820]   like, and then repeat a few frames. So it goes, so it looks like a machine gun, all this stuff that
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:47.100]   I'm start sweating as I'm watching it going. I can't believe I made this movie with that freaking
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:52.340]   camera. I don't know how I did. I couldn't even see. I'm there with this long lens, pulling my own
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:57.900]   focus. When I finally had to do a real movie, I was operating the camera in my first real movie with a
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:04.960]   crew. And I get the camera and a guy comes over and he focuses for you. That's your job. You focus?
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:09.280]   Shit, I had to do my own focusing on the last movie. I didn't, it was so hard. You're trying
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.120]   to focus on a guy while you're filming, you don't know where you are. And it's just, I was,
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.220]   couldn't believe how much easier it is when you have a crew.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:23.300]   It's extremely valuable to know that the pain of that, the, the spectrum of creativity that's
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:28.840]   allowed within that, even just the focusing, like how focusing fucks up on all the cameras and
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.220]   newer cameras. What, what are the different artifacts that come up just to know the battlefield in order
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.920]   to be a great general. You have to know how to be a soldier on the battlefield.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.700]   Yeah. Yeah. It's good to know all that stuff, but you know, it's like the end of the day,
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:44.920]   you could shoot something on a phone and if you have a great story, no one's going to even notice.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.680]   They'll be, Oh, we shot that on a phone. I didn't notice, you know? So sometimes people get cut up on,
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.340]   what kind of camera should I have? It's like, it's not the camera. That's just the tool. That's just
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:56.900]   the pen. That's just like, yeah, you can have different paint brushes, but you can go, I'm going to,
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.780]   I'm going to limit my palette. I'm only going to use a fan brush and a detail brush and I'm going
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.320]   to make a painting. Do you think that painting is going to suffer? No, it's going to take on an
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   identity that you wouldn't have had if you had all the other tools. So sometimes the limitations help
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:14.700]   you because when you can do anything, you come, it can be crippling. When I knew I could only use
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:18.720]   those things for mariachi, it's like, all right, well, it's very, it's very simple now. Let me show
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.440]   you how cheapskate I was. Like I did not spend on anything. So when you see him walking around with a guitar
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:29.440]   case, it's a shitty cardboard one, you know, like I got from home, I had to get a heavier one to put
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:36.640]   the guns in. So we borrowed one, but it had this material ripped off the top. So you could see the
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   wood. It's just the wood on top. So it didn't match the other one because it wasn't all black. And I was
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.760]   too cheap to paint it black. I didn't want to spend money on paint. So you see that cardboard case,
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.220]   he puts it down. And when he goes to open it, I cut to the other one. Once the wood is,
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.520]   is watch the edits, you'll see it open. Now it's a completely different case for the guns.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.360]   And when he goes to cut it, when he close it, it cuts to the other one. And he goes, oh, that's how
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.240]   I did that whole movie. Again, it was a practice film. I don't want to waste any money on it.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.440]   I don't know if it's going to be even, I won't be able to make five bucks from it.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:15.220]   Yeah. But you're one of the, one of the few great directors where both the movie's genius
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:20.700]   and the process of making it is creative genius. It's like fun to watch both, to know of both.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.860]   You know what I believe, right? It's like, it's not me. I have to say that thing is freaking,
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:32.160]   I didn't get in its way. That's basically what helped. And people say that, you know,
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.500]   don't get in your own way. This is a little bit easier to understand. It's like,
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:40.320]   keep the pipe clear. Don't block it with your ego. Don't say you're going to be shocked,
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.220]   but don't ever say, oh shit, how do I do that? I don't know if I can do that. You didn't do it
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.180]   to begin with, except that it just came through you and try to get back into that headspace.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:53.220]   Especially when you go to make a second film or a third film or follow up a success. That's when
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.760]   artists get really crippled because sometimes they start tiptoeing around as an artist going like,
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.380]   oh shit, now it's my second film. My first one did really well. They might not like my second one so
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.920]   much. That's not the headspace you were in when you made the first one. You weren't hesitant like that.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.580]   So try to keep that very naive. And that's why I say commit to a body of work. Because I know a lot
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:17.460]   of filmmakers get stuck on their second one and then go further because they get crippled by the
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.640]   success of the first one. And they start asking, oh shit, how did I do that? How can I do that again?
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.600]   And you get deeper and deeper in a hole you can't get out of.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.260]   I think you've spoken about that filmmakers, especially early on in their journey,
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:34.100]   critics and the audience can destroy them. Meaning like it creates too much of a burden,
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:40.560]   too much, just wear them down to where they're almost scared to be creative. Can you just speak
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.300]   to that, how to ignore the critic? I'll tell you something that my best advice ever got
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:52.780]   early on. I was so fortunate from an unlikely place. Because he's such a, he sounded like Clint
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:59.740]   Eastwood when he said it. It was funny when you said that. But I got Desperado and Antonio Banderas.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:06.040]   I brought Antonio to be in it from Europe. Big action movie. And so Spielberg saw it and he said,
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.840]   um, Hey, I want you to do Zorro with Antonio. So we're working on it for a while. I did, I was
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.820]   working on the pre-production. I got to work with Spielberg doing that. It ended up stalling me as
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:19.900]   the, there was like two studios involved and Amblin was moving or it was some weird thing where,
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:25.460]   but I got to work with him for about five months, you know? And I started getting really nervous
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.500]   cause it's like, Oh shit. You start thinking about even movies of his that people would say,
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.540]   Oh, you know, temple of doom is not as good as Raiders. Have you seen temple of doom?
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:37.460]   I'd been killed if I can do that movie. Yeah. If I can make Zorro as good as that one,
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.820]   the one that people said, it's like, people don't know how good they had it with that guy.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:46.460]   But I started thinking, I even said, man, I just rewatched temple of doom last night. I don't know
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.640]   how I'm going to do this Zorro movie. Like I've just never done anything like that.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.360]   You start getting, you know, afraid cause you go, the second thing he said, all right,
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.120]   just, just, you're going to do fine. But then I started thinking, this guy at that time,
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:07.380]   you don't know the era, but this was like mid nineties. He was making the biggest,
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:11.320]   best movies of all. And people would shit all over this guy. They would throw so much. They
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:17.060]   were so jealous press audience. Everyone was just like hits at him. Just throwing rocks at him
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.640]   for everything. Spielberg? Yeah. You can't imagine it now. You had to
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.420]   been at that time. Now everyone has respect for him, but they made him run a fucking gauntlet
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:31.880]   and they were like drastic parm. Yeah. You can't even imagine it now, but you should have seen the
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.640]   climate. It freaked me out. Cause I'm like, maybe I should just stay under the radar where I've been,
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.000]   you know, not poke my head out so much. Yeah. Cause this guy has a head out and they're
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.840]   unwarranted. You can't even fathom it now. Cause you weren't here at that time.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.700]   It was crazy. You never even think of him that way. I'm glad it changed because back then it was
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:58.000]   just, it made people not want to be successful. And I made me be worried. Like maybe I shouldn't be
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.760]   go making a movie that has his name on it. That's going to put my head out in a whole different realm
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:08.100]   of filming at a studio level. Cause if I make it, even if I make a good movie, if I make a great movie,
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.320]   he's making great movies and he's getting this dog shit. I don't know if I could take it,
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:17.500]   you know? So I asked him cause you don't know how resilient you can be. So I said,
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:22.680]   I mean, man, how do you do it? How do you, how do you, what do you do when people just
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:28.820]   throw rocks at you all day long? He goes, Oh Robert, you just don't blink.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:36.260]   And I was like, Whoa, now I see how he got through it. Just don't blink. Just like,
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:42.580]   you know, it's coming. Don't blink. And to him say it's like a Clint Eastwood line. Right. But it was
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:49.140]   like, you could see he was telling the truth and you could see that's how he did it. He just avoided
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:55.120]   all criticism by just not blinking. It's like, it's designed to make you blink and you're just
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.840]   not going to blink. Cause you're committing to a body of work. He just keeps cranking out movies,
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.760]   whatever he feels like doing. He does. And that was like the most power. And it never bothered me
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.400]   again. I just like always kept in mind. I tell that to my actors. I tell that people that story has
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:13.160]   traveled. Uh, I even had some little actors who were like starting to get up and I said, I remember
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.800]   tell you a couple of things. Some people have told me you're never as good as people say you are.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:22.740]   And you're never as bad either. That's what you're cleaning. So I remember that. And then the second
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:30.000]   one, Spielberg, don't blink, don't blink. But there has to be a kind of vision for yourself
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   of what, what, what you're reaching for, what you're trying to do again. Yeah. Sort of, sort of like,
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.860]   I think if you told me what would be my vision for the future, just committing to a body of work,
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:46.020]   which I've just kept doing. Like that's, it's about as far as you can see.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:51.160]   Do you have a sense, do you have a vision of the body of work you'll make in the next 20 years?
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:55.180]   Like, or is it just this fog? I did, I did. Like I wasn't sure. Because you don't always know what
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.700]   the, you might not have the vision yet because you don't have the information yet. So if you just commit
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:02.580]   to a body of work, you'll start figuring out more reasons to keep doing that body of work.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:09.340]   So when I turned 50, I was like, I guess I could just keep making movies. I mean, I guess that's
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:12.560]   been good for me. I guess I could just make more. I kind of
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:17.560]   done that already, but it's always fun and it's always new. And I guess I could make,
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.620]   but it wasn't a lot of drive. Right. It's like, that's not, it's like, well, I guess I could just
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:25.360]   keep doing the body. You know, that's not as much as I can't wait to keep doing another season.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.380]   But I didn't know how to get to that point. So I thought, you know what? I got to this job so
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:36.560]   early. I was in the early twenties. I bet there's some other job out there that exists that I don't
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.680]   even know about because I don't know other jobs. So I looked up, you don't believe it, but I literally
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.340]   bought jobs for dummies. Nice.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:48.020]   I was just like, I don't even know what basic jobs are even out there turning the page. Oh yeah. Don't
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.520]   want that job. Don't want that job. Don't want that job. I'm just going through and it gets to
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:57.740]   filmmaker and there's a little icon to tell these job. This icon is a guy like this. Literally you
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:02.420]   look it up. It's a, and it says, this is the best job ever. You get to just be creative with your
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:10.440]   friends, sit back, watch the money roll in across the desk. And I said, but 99% of film students don't
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.540]   get this job. So give up that dream. So I was like, I guess I got the best job. But then I started
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:21.520]   working with my kids when we did, uh, I had a TV show called rebel without a crew based on that.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.600]   Right. I found filmmakers who'd only made a short film. They hadn't made a feature. I picked this
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.800]   diverse group of filmmakers, gave them $7,000 and we documented them making a feature two weeks.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.760]   Like I did. You can bring one person. Like I had Carlos guy out of the producer and star
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   of Mariachi bring one person. It'd be your cameraman or you can be your sound guy or whatever. But it's
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.100]   only that for the shoot. And you'd have to do the whole thing. And I saw those guys by the time
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.360]   they're, they're like, I don't know how we're going to make this movie. By the first week of shooting,
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.520]   they're already talking about their next feature. They became so confident because their idea of what
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.220]   impossible is drops really quick when you take it. Yeah. Uh, anyone interested in, uh,
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.940]   unlocking their creativities, they're not even just filmmaking. I highly recommend that show.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:07.100]   And I highly recommend the kind of the follow on show, which is where you make red 11.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.900]   Yeah. So that's the one I did. So then it came time for me to do one. So I made a movie called
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:16.420]   red 11 based on my experiences in the medical hospital, but I'll turn it into a sci-fi thriller
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:20.480]   just to use that as, so that I can use like somebody getting stabbed in the eye. So I can still
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.760]   have more elements to show how you can do camera tricks and stuff with no money. And the whole day is
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.800]   make it for less than $7,000, which I think we're like $5,000, uh, mainly because we had a lot of
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.520]   actors I wanted to pay. Um, but the movie itself can make it for nothing. But I brought my son aboard
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.260]   as my number one who hadn't been working with me in a while. I mean, he wrote shark point lava go when
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:45.280]   he was seven, but then he hadn't really been at working on my crew. So he didn't know how to operate
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.400]   the sound equipment, the separate sound system and all that. I didn't show him until the day of filming.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.400]   Cause I knew we're documenting it would make a better tutorial. So by getting them working on
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.280]   the movies together, they came to be super excited. By the end of the day, I thought for sure, oh,
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.880]   they're going to hate this. Even though it's only two weeks, they've got other interests. They don't
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:08.180]   want to be filmmakers. I thought they were going to be like, all right, I'm out of here after one day.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:12.420]   But instead he came to me and his brother who acted in it. And he went, dad,
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.660]   the actor didn't show up after the first day. The location didn't match the script at all.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.380]   We asked you how we're going to solve the problems. And you're like, I don't know,
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:28.400]   figure it out. We thought dad stumped for once. Is he stumped finally? But then by the end of the day,
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.220]   his eyes were all white. We figured it out. I went, oh, they don't realize this is the creative
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:38.860]   process. Every day is like that. And in life too, every day, you don't know your machine's going to
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:44.400]   not work or you're going to get a flat tire or you get fired that day. So life is very
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.440]   unpredictable, just like a movie set. So I realized I'm going to make them all work on my movies now
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:55.640]   because it's teaching them about life. I'm teaching them very little about the film make. It's about
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.680]   life lessons, about how you take on something impossible, turn chicken shit to chicken salad
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:05.200]   and make it work. And that's the straw and that's life. That's the process of life. So many people say,
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.760]   well, I'm not ready to make my projects. Like you're not ready for life either. You're like this,
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:14.100]   all day you're dodging shit that's going on. How come art has to be perfect? It's like,
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:16.100]   it should be the same. Life and art should be the same.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:21.160]   And I think filmmaking in general is full of unpredictable things.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.620]   And in a short little microcosm too, within one project, you've got a whole blueprint for
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.060]   how you're going to solve life because you've just done it on a creative level.
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:33.220]   I think of all the art forms of all the art mediums like that, it just has so many different
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:37.260]   components, a lot of components to it. And so like, there's so many ways to fuck things up,
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:43.380]   to learn from, but any of the disciplines, if you add those to it, like I teach my actors to paint
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:50.160]   in between takes, we'll go and we'll, I'll take a picture of them in character. I show them a canvas,
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.460]   I show them paint. You don't need to know how to paint. This is to show you the brush is going to
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.320]   know where to go. You just got to pick it up, pick the colors you want. Doesn't matter how crazy they
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.000]   are, whatever's speaking to you, you lay it down. I'll show you some of the pictures. You're not going to
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.400]   believe the masterworks these actors did like in a day. They just start doing it. Lady Gaga had her
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.260]   fingernails in there. You know, Josh Brolin's doing his thing. Then I take a picture of them in
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.940]   character, do a line drawing of it. We project it on top. And mostly it's the painting coming through,
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.640]   their line drawing with a little bit of their eyes painted in. You're not going to believe these
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:23.440]   things. They couldn't believe it, but it teaches them that, that thing about that, the creativity is
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.720]   going to come through. So even though they're already acting, they're already being creative,
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.620]   we're already making a movie. Like you said, that's already a really great creative endeavor.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:35.360]   When we would sneak off and paint, you could tell it's firing a whole other part of their brain.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:42.980]   It was funny. I think Josh Brolin's girlfriend said, Josh said, hey, my girlfriend just said,
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:50.580]   she said, his wife now, but at the time, are you guys doing drugs? You leave the set and you come
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:55.200]   back and you're all like, no, we're painting, we're painting. But that makes sense that you say that
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:00.400]   when you get your creativity firing, it's more powerful than any drug. And we would come back
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.220]   and he'd be on the set going, is it bad that I'm still thinking about the painting? And I'm like,
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:09.260]   no, I think it's good. I think it's all good. But it's, you can tell it's opening a whole other part
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:14.300]   of their creative brain. So you can be doing acting in a movie and the painting is still going to tap.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:19.860]   It shows how much untapped potential your creative brain has. So the more you can do, the more you're
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.560]   firing off. And it was so cool. Like I remember we did one with Joseph Gordon-Levitt was painting.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.720]   We came in and the table was like this. And they said, we have a problem. You want them to throw
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:34.460]   the cards out, the playing cards out, but it's so slick. They go sliding off the table. And we both
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:39.320]   look at it and we both got the solution at the same time. Oh, we just, just, just haven't, just have
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:45.880]   them throw them wherever they go. And then we'll place them. And then digitally, it's even better that
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.520]   he looks like he gets them all perfectly laid out to show what a card shark he is. That's, but that's
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.440]   what we have to do because we're not going to, we can't, we'll be here all day. We're trying to get,
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.420]   if we're going to worry about where they go, just go bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. And then
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:04.080]   we'll place the cards down and everyone will pick them up and then we'll marry the two in post.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.760]   You know, you're just, you just come up with creative solutions better, easier because you
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.440]   were just solving crazy creative solutions. And the other one, like what paint medium do I use?
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.060]   What kind of gel am I going to use? So when you come back to your main job, which is filmmaking,
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:21.280]   you're like, Oh, I can figure this out in two seconds, you know, so it helps you creative problem
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.680]   solve. So that basically working with my kids made me realize, Oh, now I know exactly what I want to do
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.780]   for the next 10 years. I only want to make movies with my kids because I'm mentoring them, but they're
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:35.040]   teaching me shit. Cause they were the age I was when I made Mariachi and Desperado and their,
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.540]   their ideas are really sharp. So the mentoring goes both ways. And it's like the greatest parenting
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:44.260]   you can do. Cause you're building a project together and in the same boat together, figuring
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:49.340]   it out. And it's family time. You're like checking all the boxes. So I thought my filmmaking going
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:53.540]   forward is going to be checking all the boxes in life. So I'm not, not spending time with my family.
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:58.280]   We're actually giving them lessons that they can go do anything they want in life. Cause they're
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.440]   going to have different interests, but now it's kind of like going to college. And this college is like
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.300]   the best college. Cause it pays you to learn. You get to do these crazy skills. Like my son is,
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:13.240]   you know, conducting the orchestra, the James Bond orchestra in London for the spy kid score and a
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:19.000]   score he wrote. Cause I can't write at his level because he was always our best piano player and
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.680]   they get, you get the charge out of working with them. And then, and by making a label, there's a,
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.280]   there's a weird phenomenon that happens. If you guys want to take your game to another level,
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:36.900]   I stumbled upon this idea. My son, that was my counterpart on that movie racer. He was my
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:41.040]   sound guy. Like I said, came up with shark point lava girl and he's little, he became my writer,
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.840]   co-writer, co-producer. He had come to me and said, I want to do VR type movie.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.440]   And I said, Oh, let me show you as an example of creativity and manifesting. I said, let me show
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.840]   you how it works. Let's, let's make a company. We'll make a company called double R, double R
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.760]   productions. Cause we all have a double R names, all the kids. So if anyone ever wants to do anything,
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.840]   we can use our company. So let's make a logo and I'll make t-shirts and notepads and stuff.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:12.480]   Cause once you have a company, you have now have to make things for that company.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.000]   Just like the advice I gave to people, stop aspiring, make a business card that says
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.900]   writer, director, cinematographer, I did editor. Cause then now you have to conform to that identity.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:25.900]   So now if I create a label like double R, we're going to come up with ideas. We'll call up
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:30.640]   VR companies and say, Hey, we have a company, a VR company. Would you like us to make you a film
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.560]   for your, sell your headsets? Yeah. They gave us a budget. They they they're dying for content.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.140]   They gave us a budget. We shot a 20 minute action movie called the limit with Michelle
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:44.000]   Rodriguez and Norman Reedus, where you're in an action movie with them. And it was killer. We,
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.880]   they made us a big double R logo, animated logo. Later that year, we did red 11, same logo.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:57.940]   That movie went to directors, Fortnite and can festivals were paying us to come talk about how
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.200]   we made that movie. That's when we're doing the cards, throwing the cards out because they
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.720]   wanted their audiences. They knew they would love that. So we could have had a whole
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:10.140]   gig just continuing to get paid to go to the Fed. Usually you pay to go to the Fed. You don't get
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:14.740]   paid. That's how, what a success that was. But then we had to make, we can be heroes.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:21.000]   So we had to stop, but we can be heroes was a Netflix movie where they asked me to make a spy kids type
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.040]   thing. And so I thought, Oh, okay, I'll just do it with superheroes. That's their, I wrote it with my
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.960]   kids based it on some of their personalities. It's the most watched and rewatched movie in Netflix
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.880]   history. Like nothing in touch. Cause kids just keep watching it over. Cause it's kids with
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.300]   superpowers. No one's ever done that before. And they can't, they couldn't believe it. Like I'd heard
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.400]   anecdotally. That's how the spy kids, there were people said, Oh, that kids watch it over and over on
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.060]   video, but you can't keep track of that. You can't on Netflix because their biggest thing is people
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.920]   completing the movie. A lot of people don't complete a movie and it still counts as a view.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.640]   They may watch five minutes and change the channel. So do you complete a movie? That's really where
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.780]   they, you know, really value not only to be complete, but rewatched, rewatched, rewatched
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:09.200]   per household. That's so many times. That one has a double R logo as well. And my kids are like,
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.820]   dad, it really worked. I was like, I know better than I thought. I didn't know. I didn't know that
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:20.160]   me manifesting that company was going to turn into that. And we've just keep making stuff. So I want
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.060]   to do that with brass knuckle films now with the audience. Cause it works. So I said, as soon as you
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:31.820]   have a logo and a company, your brain starts coming up with all kinds of ideas and it's a filter.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:38.400]   Like, like I said, sometimes the freedom of limitations is all freeing. When I had to do
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.400]   four rooms and it's like, we have to use one hotel room. Oh, well then there's going to be a dead body.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.080]   There's going to be, you can do a lot with limitations. If they said you could use the whole
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.460]   city would have been harder to come up with something. Well, brass knuckle films has a filter,
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.540]   only action action movies. Cause that's the stuff that there's always an appetite for.
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.820]   If you ask Netflix right now, what do you need more of? They'll say action, action, action. We
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:03.500]   don't have enough action. The last regime didn't leave us enough action. We need action. They'll
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:08.920]   pay a premium for an action film that we can make at a lower cost. A $20 million action film is very
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.820]   cheap. Studios don't know how to make them that cheap. That's why they'll pay for an independent to
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:17.740]   go do it. And right now that's the key is to be independent. Cause a lot of studios that can't even
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:21.380]   greenlight anything cause things are so expensive. They don't want to lose their ass, but they need
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:26.540]   action films. So let's make something that everybody needs and let's make it at a price.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:29.860]   And we'll make it in my studio because I got my own studio and I can keep all the costs down. Cause we
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:36.260]   have all the costumes and props and sets from 25 years of filmmaking to keep the costs down.
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:42.640]   And we'll have the audience gets to invest. It's not crowdfunding or Kickstarter. You're actually
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:48.300]   an investor. Anyone who puts money in can pitch their idea for an action film to me.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:54.420]   And I'm going to make one of the four films in that slate from one of those ideas. Cause I want
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:58.060]   the audience to win. I want the audience to win and be a part of it. Cause the audience is an
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.860]   afterthought in Hollywood. They make a movie. They show the audience, the movie, go tell your friends
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:06.600]   now. So y'all spend money on our movie. Well, where's your cut of that? So I want them to be
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:11.380]   successful. So if any of the movies in the slate do well, they make money off that one. And then
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:16.040]   sequels or anything, but they're all going to do well because everyone needs an action movie or we're
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:21.660]   going to keep the costs down. Can I actually ask you just to focus in on action? You've created a lot
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:28.600]   of epic action films. What makes for a great action film? It comes down to the character. You know,
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:33.680]   like if you think about what are the best action films, what are your favorite films? Like die hard.
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:39.420]   He's a cop. So he's still capable, but he's not Superman. The fact that he's like in over his head
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.880]   and you're rooting for him. That's a great character. You know, John wick, he is Superman,
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.780]   but he's retired. And now he's pissed off and he's going back into a job, you know? So the care is
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:55.360]   comes down to the character really being very important because the action will then have a
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:02.520]   character to it. I think Leon, the professional does what's it. I mean, that's all that when I say
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:06.160]   we're going to do action movies. I mean, movies that are really action first. Like there's some
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.760]   movies that are more dramas that have action.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.640]   Where's the boundary? So John wick is action.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.980]   That's more action, but it has character in it, but it's action driven.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:15.640]   What about like predator?
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:20.140]   Predator is a sci-fi action film. So that's kind of a hybrid, which I like,
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:23.280]   but sometimes it's hard for the audience to know what they're buying into.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.560]   Like they focused a lot on the action in the trailer, you know, and then they felt there was some
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.800]   other worldly thing, but you didn't really know, but it's a great movie.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.080]   So die hard is a, is a good example.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.300]   It was a good example. Right. I think of right off where there's a character that really made
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:39.720]   the difference. And then everyone repeated that, you know, for a while it was like under siege. I was
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:45.860]   like a regular guy who's really actually has some training on a ship now. And then on the bus,
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:49.680]   you've got a cop, he's a cop, but he's not super cop. So that's why you root for him. You know,
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.860]   that became a, an element that people repeated a lot.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:52.980]   What about taken?
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.060]   That's a great one. That's a great character who is superhuman.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:02.940]   Who's also retired, you know, so there's like a superhero type character in an extraordinary
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:08.060]   circumstance. Like that's now his daughter's taken. Right. And then there's ordinary people
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:11.860]   like the Terminator. That's a great character. Not the Terminator. He's a villain, but Sarah Connor,
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:17.240]   who is a waitress, doesn't think her life's going anywhere. And she finds out she's the mother of
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.400]   the guy who's going to save the human race. And she's got to train him. You know, suddenly she has
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:27.520]   to become someone else. Those are cool movies. Cause it's a Genesis of a character and you see a
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:33.720]   character go from waitress to revolutionary step up. Yeah. What about mob movies? I mean,
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:38.060]   some of them are like Godfather is really not about, it's not an action movie drama that has some
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:42.580]   action. Right. I mean, John Wick is a mob film in some sense. Goodfellas. I mean, there's a lot
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:48.080]   dynamic action, but there's really not action first. That's really a character type piece. Great.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:52.420]   Freaking amazing. And it feels like action by the way he does it. It's just like that. It's like
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:57.640]   fast pace, fast talking, fast moving. Like Escape from New York is one of my favorites since I was a
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.820]   kid. Cause every movie you'll notice this now that I tell you, even like a romantic comedy,
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:08.480]   there's a timeline. Every movie has to have like a ticking clock. So the audience knows the stories
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.600]   are not just going to take over a period of years. So suddenly someone in the movie around 20 or 30
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:19.060]   minutes in, we'll say, we've got to go find the groom before the wedding this weekend. You know,
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.740]   it'll be just like that. Escape from New York has the best example of a ticking time clock. Cause he's
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:29.120]   literally got bombs in his neck and he's got a watch that shows him he's constantly clocking it,
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.620]   how little time he has. And he gets you so like, Oh my God, is he going to make it? Um, that's like
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:40.200]   the best use of that. And no one's ever topped that ticking time clock. All the other ones seem
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.740]   artificial in comparison, you know, aliens, you know, we got to get off this planet now. Cause
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:50.220]   this whole thing's going to blow up. You know, they like, there's a timeline and you're, it's
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:55.700]   already urgent, but now there's an extra timeline on it. You know, this is what happens as you're
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:01.140]   talking. You're just making me fall in love more and more with action films. I, I sometimes you forget
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.100]   how much you love action. A really good action film. Yeah. In fact, like the Terminator,
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:09.540]   the original Terminator just came out in 4k. I've been watching it again. It looks like better than
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:13.800]   most movies look today. And that's a $4 million movie. It looks incredible. I mean, you can see
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:19.800]   every beat of sweat in this movie. I was watching it again with somebody, a female, and there's always
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:26.720]   a point when you're watching that movie where she'll turn and say, I love this movie. You know,
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:31.820]   point that is, it's the point where Michael Biehn tells her, I came across time for you, Sarah.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:36.540]   I love you. Which is, you know, I always have. And you're just like, oh my God, there's like a real
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:44.280]   emotional love story there that he put into Titanic, that he put into Avatar. He figured out that thing
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.300]   that makes those movies work. By the way, I should say that. I mean, there is an aspect of, uh,
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:54.940]   El Mirachi that is a love story to me. Yeah, it was a rough story. I don't know if you see it that
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:59.200]   way, but I got, when I just rewatched it, I was like. It's a tragic love story, but I was like
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.800]   heartbroken that she's dead. I got heartbroken twice. Let me tell you the second time it happened.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.480]   One, you're making that and you go, okay, this is how it has to go. But then now you're invested
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.340]   in this person. You go, oh man, she has to die. It's going to be really sad. In fact, the studio,
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.920]   even when they said they were going to remake it, good thing I put that ending on. That's the only
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.460]   reason they showed it to an audience. We weren't going to remake it. They weren't going to put that
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:26.420]   movie out. They showed it, said, we need to show this movie to an audience because they might not like
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:30.400]   the fact that we killed a girl before we remake it. All right. They showed it to an audience. The audience
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:35.100]   liked it the way it was. So they said, we're going to take this movie to some film festivals. And I was
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:41.500]   like, no, not this movie. This is my practice movie. No one's supposed to see this movie. And they go,
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:45.420]   no, no, you got something. No, no, dude, if I knew anyone was going to see this, I would have shot it
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.220]   completely. Give me $2,000. I'll go reshoot half of it. Just knowing people are going to see it. I want
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:54.280]   something. And the head of the studio was really smart. He said, you don't know what you have here.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.240]   There's something real special. Let's take it to Telluride and see what happened. Telluride, Toronto
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.760]   did great. And like I said, in one Sundance. So now we had to put it out. But I was like, I would have
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:09.280]   said, don't show that movie. But they also questioned the ending and didn't come into play because we
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.160]   ended up making Desperado. And the girl in Desperado doesn't die. You know, we didn't do that. We didn't kill
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.240]   Salma. But that's what needed to happen to Mariachi. Quentin called me one time. People
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.940]   would always say like, oh, Reservoir Dogs. He borrowed from this movie, Hong Kong action film
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.880]   called City on Fire. It's about these guys. They're all criminals and they kill each other or whatever.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:32.000]   And he said, hey, they're showing a double feature called East Looks West and West Looks East.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.820]   They're showing Reservoir Dogs with City on Fire, the one they say I borrowed from. And they're showing
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.220]   Mariachi with a Hong Kong film called Run, where they ripped off Mariachi. Like they just took the
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:48.580]   whole story. It had two Chinese actors in Mexico with the guitar cases. They just followed it beat
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:53.960]   by beat. So we were watching it and it was like scene by scene. They just rebate it without even
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.500]   getting the rights or anything. It was so fun to watch. So we saw Mariachi first, then we watched
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:04.380]   that one. And I'm like, what's this big brothel scene though? This is in my movie. Oh, there's this
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:08.220]   scene in my movie where the bad guy has two girls in bed with him and they figured that was a
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:13.220]   whorehouse, but it was just this apartment. So they got this whorehouse built up and they have
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:19.280]   helicopter shots and all kinds of big thing. And the action was awesome. But then, and the girl's
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.580]   really good. And then midway through the movie, I'm like, oh shit, she's going to die because I killed
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:28.020]   her in mine. I don't want her to die. I like this actress. It's really great. And they have a really
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:33.240]   great love story. I go, well, I hope they change that part. No, they kill her. So I felt bad twice
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:40.500]   because I sealed, I sealed her fate. I sealed her fate because I have a line in Spike Kids 2.
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:47.140]   And I started thinking when you create stuff, you start thinking, I wonder if that's how our creator
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:52.620]   is. He's like, oh shit, I just kind of threw that in a memo and now that whole town's going to get
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:58.520]   wiped out. You know, I didn't even think about the implications of that. Um, cause there's a line
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.660]   I was making a character that Steve Buscemi plays in Spike Kids 2 and he's a creator.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.900]   He just wanted to make a little miniature zoo for kids. And then he thought, well, what if I put
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:15.440]   some together like a lizard with a snake and it's a slizzard or you have a spider monkey, which is
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:21.060]   like literally spider legs and a monkey top. So he makes that. And then he thought, hey, why don't I
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:26.260]   make, make them a little bit bigger for kids that have big hands and it got out of control and they
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.720]   turn into these huge creatures and now they're trying to eat them. So he's hiding. The kids find
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.920]   him hiding. And he says this one line that people keep coming. It's on the internet a lot. This meme
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:42.680]   about this. Why is this blind, this movie? It's so wild. I thought I wanted Steve to come up to the
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:49.620]   camera and like, he's just, he's lost in his own creative world. And he says, I can't even go outside
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:54.640]   because my own creations are going to eat me. Then he comes up to the camera and he goes, do you think
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:01.380]   God hides in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he created here on earth? It's like really,
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:05.780]   just for a moment, this thing. And it's like, cause you feel like that way when you're, when you're
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:09.280]   creating stuff, like you're creating something and then now it's taking on a life on its own.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.740]   And it's like, oh no, now this character has to die. Oh, I didn't want that. You know,
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:17.440]   this, this domino effect of creation. And you start thinking, well, that must be what creation,
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.720]   maybe he is hiding up there because look at, he didn't expect all this shit to happen,
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.580]   giving us free will and all that. I mean, this particular context that, uh, you are the creator
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:32.380]   of this story. And it for some reason makes me feel good to know that you feel the pain of this
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:39.000]   character dying. Yeah, absolutely. Cause like if I'm, I'm writing it, but if it's not coming from me,
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.080]   I'm as surprised sometimes. And Quentin would say that, you know, he'd say, you just get two characters
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.060]   talking when I'm writing my script. And then suddenly they're just talking to each other. And I was like,
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:51.940]   what does that mean? And now, now I know what that means. It's like, he just gave them life.
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:57.260]   And now, now the dialogue's coming through him. Let me just ask you, you're the perfect person to ask
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:02.260]   about the genius of Quentin Tarantino. What makes him special as a director, as a creative mind?
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:06.300]   What do you see in him? That's beautiful. That's brilliant.
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:17.660]   Since I met him, he was just like this brilliant, uh, ball of energy. And, uh, you know, like if you
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:24.500]   see him, I walk around his house and I'll see like a few sheets of paper, all handwritten out. I'm like,
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.680]   what's that? And he goes, oh, that was something I was starting to write. And I, you know, not going
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:34.300]   to finish. I'm like, can I take these and go turn it into like a whole trilogy of films? You know,
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.640]   like what he throws away, all this mortal men would kill for you meet people like that. I tell people,
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.240]   you know, your parents say, watch out who your peers are. You know, when you're younger,
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.240]   that means one thing, but once you get older, surround yourself around people who, who swing
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:55.900]   much farther than you, you know, that's just like, but that's really true. I mean, just by being around
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:03.080]   him and working with him, you get by osmosis, you learn stuff and it just ups your game because
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:08.180]   they're just swing way beyond you. Jim Cameron was like that. So like when I first met him,
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:11.180]   I was trying to impress the hell out of him, you know, cause I was such a big fan. I was about to
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:15.580]   go do the Esperado and I went, Hey, I just took a three-day Steadicam course cause I can't afford
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.620]   a Steadicam operator. So I'm going to operate Steadicam myself on Esperado.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.500]   Now, if he was just my peer, he'd say, Oh, I did the same thing and I'm going to do the same
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.840]   thing. That, that would be like hanging out with somebody of your ilk, but you don't, you want
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.840]   somebody who's above that. Do you know what he said? He goes, I bought a Steadicam, but not to
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:38.760]   operate it. I'm going to take it apart and design a better one. Us mere mortals trying to learn how to
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.480]   operate the camera. He's designing all new systems. That's the guy you want to hang out with. Not someone
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.160]   who's doing what you're doing. So surround yourself by those kinds of people. And that's when you learn
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.720]   things like don't blink, you know, like somebody who's like really swinging for the fences and
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:59.660]   accomplishing so much. And Quentin was like that. So I met him at the festivals. He saw Mariachi. He
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:03.400]   loved it. We came up, we talked and he said, you're going to like my next film I'm writing right now,
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:08.580]   Pulp Fiction. So I thought, man, I'm going to put this guy. He's so, he's so fun. I'm going to put
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:12.000]   him in, I'm going to write him in my Desperado script, which I was writing. So that was before
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.640]   Pulp Fiction and all that. When I had cast him, I didn't know he was going to go become such a
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:21.060]   household name. I just was drawn to his energy and I'd already written him in and I met Steve
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:24.860]   Buscemi there. And I was like, I'm writing a character for Steve Buscemi. But then I went back
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:29.740]   to the Sony lot where I was working on Desperado and Quentin and I ended up having offices right next
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.720]   to each other on the Sony lot by accident. I didn't even know that. I just met him and I go back and he
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.300]   just, cause originally Pulp Fiction was for TriStar cause Danny DeVito was a producer and he was going to
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:44.280]   make it for TriStar. So he was there writing Pulp Fiction and I was writing Desperado. So I'd go show him
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.660]   like storyboards from Desperado and he'd come act out scenes of Pulp Fiction. And we got to be really
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:54.180]   good friends that way. We'd go eat lunch at Versailles across the street, the Sony lot. And then
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:43:03.120]   Sony passed on Pulp Fiction. It's too weird, it's too long, $8 million movie or $7 million. They're
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.280]   like, eh, we're going to go make the next Pauly Shore movie instead. You know, like we don't
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:10.700]   understand this thing. And Miramax got it and they'd just been bought by Disney. So they produced their
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:17.080]   first film was Pulp Fiction and then that thing went to Cannes and it was a whole thing. But what I loved
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:24.220]   about his story is that when he made Pulp Fiction, he had a director screening. He showed it to some
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:28.100]   directors and I wasn't able to go. But anyway, I had dinner with him once and it was in my journal
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:34.440]   because I keep a journal. At 2.40 a.m. when after I dropped him off at his house, I said,
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.180]   oh wait, how did your movie come out? You know, Pulp Fiction, he had just finished it and he went,
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:43.160]   nah, it's still, it still feels like a movie Quentin would make. It doesn't feel like a real movie.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:48.300]   And I was like, that's fine. What do you mean? What does it mean? It feels like one of those
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:52.580]   movies I would make, like Reservoir Dogs. It doesn't feel like a real movie. And I was trying to be the
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:56.640]   supportive friend going, oh man, he was so excited about this movie. Now he's bummed about it.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.240]   And I was like, well, it should be different. It should be like, he's like, wouldn't have it.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.700]   Drove off. So I thought, I don't know, I guess that wasn't the one. So I went home and I called
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:09.920]   some of the directors that were at the screening and they go, yeah, this isn't the one for him.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:15.320]   It's not, they had, none of them saw it. None of them saw it, but that, you know, you're like surprised.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:20.340]   But that happened with George Lucas too, with Star Wars. Everybody saw that movie and was like,
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:24.040]   poor George. They showed it to all his director friends. Poor George, what do you just waste all
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.480]   this time with this for? Only Spielberg was the one who said, it's naive and it's going to do really
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:33.440]   good because it's naive and kids will like it. But everyone else was like, what's he doing? We're
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.880]   artists. We're making art films. What's he doing this garbage for? Because nobody knows. It shows no
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.640]   one knows anything. Not even the filmmaker. When you're being groundbreaking, you don't know what
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.960]   groundbreaking is. Not you or anyone around you, except maybe one or two people. So he said,
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.340]   there's one person like, oh yeah, who is your Spielberg? Goes Catherine Bigelow,
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:53.220]   without a doubt. She's the only one who said, there's something here. No one else was seeing,
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:58.160]   was saying that. He said, in fact, because he remembered suddenly he'd forgotten the story,
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.540]   but if it wasn't in my journal, I would have forgot it too. He goes, in fact, one of my friends,
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:06.180]   Simon said, I want to sit you down and tell you all the things that are wrong with your movie,
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:10.920]   but I'll wait till you get back from the Cannes Film Festival. And he goes and he wins the Palme d'Or.
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:14.160]   Then his friend's like, oh, what the hell do I know? I've only made one movie myself. So
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.800]   nevermind. I guess, I guess we're all wrong. So even he didn't expect that at all. So that was a
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:26.820]   shock, you know, even to him. So think about that. Yeah. That means, what do you do? Commit to a body
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:30.140]   of work. Just do that. You don't know. You don't know what's going to be a Pulp Fiction and what's
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:34.600]   going to be a Jackie Brown. What's going to be, you know, you don't know. And you'd like to think
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:39.620]   they know, but they don't know either. They feel it. Like I asked Jim Cameron, I said, do you see your
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:44.000]   movie really clearly? Like, can you see it like with, with hyper-focus? Cause it seems like that.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.040]   And he goes, it's like really far. It's out of focus. And you work on it and you work on it,
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.640]   it starts coming. I said, okay, good. So that's, that's normal. I thought maybe he had laser vision
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:58.920]   or something, but no, even him, he doesn't really know, but he feels that he can make decisions and
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:04.500]   he understands what a creative drive is and how to just keep being relentless about it.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:14.140]   But it's not like they have all the, proximity is huge. Proximity will change your life. Did for me,
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:18.780]   just being around those guys. They didn't teach me, Hey, I'm going to teach you how to make a movie.
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:25.820]   Just being next to them, being in their world, just ups your game. And you just, you're able to do
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:29.760]   things you weren't able to do before. You get ideas you didn't get to do before. I did. I'll show you
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.720]   one of my painting things. You're not going to believe this freaking thing. I had a painter friend
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.160]   in Germany, Sebastian Kruger. He gives a workshop once a year that I'm going to go there. And I bet
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.900]   I'll learn more about directing by watching this guy paint than I will by watching another director.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:51.360]   Cause that's just now I know how creativity works. You're going to learn lessons outside of the box
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.240]   by doing that. And I try to practice before going out there. I was doing a Danny Trejo. I'll show you
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.960]   the before and after you're not going to freaking believe what you see, but this is, it really tells
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:07.680]   a story of how important proximity is. So I'm, I do this painting. It's like, ah, it looks garbage.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:13.380]   I'll show you. It looks like garbage. I'm not used. I can't do paintings that are just like,
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:17.740]   see, I, you never should say I can't cause you just cut your leg off, but I couldn't at the time
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:22.600]   paint, just paintbrush into paint and then write on the canvas like that without using some kind of
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:28.300]   medium, which this guy, Sebastian Kruger would do. So first I did a digital painting of Danny Trejo,
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:32.720]   like just to get the framing and all that. And then I created, that's just like, that's like
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.380]   on a Wacom tablet, but then I did it with paint and it's like, ah, it's all cruddy. And it's too
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:42.320]   thick, the pain. And it just looks, it looks, and I just gave up right away. I went, I was trying to
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:46.540]   pre-practice. I wouldn't be a total buffoon there because it was going the next week. And I thought
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:52.300]   he's using a different brush. Obviously he's using a better paint. The stuff just is clogging up and it's crap.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:59.540]   I'm sure when I get there. So I get there and he's doing a Mick Jagger and he starts with a mid-tone.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:03.500]   He starts blocking in the face with a little tiny drawing of where the face goes.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:09.100]   He starts doing that. He starts adding some highlights. There's the photo, his reference.
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:15.680]   And I'm like, why, why are you, why are you concentrating so much on the cheek first? And he's
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:22.480]   like, it's different every time. And I go, why do you, what, what paints are you using? And he's like,
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:28.080]   it was regular acrylic paint. What brushes do you have? Regular brushes. I'm like, how come mine doesn't
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.600]   look like yours? Well, let me try what he's doing. I mean, you start with a mid-tone. I'm going to do
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:38.020]   that Danny again. Start with a mid-tone. I'll start adding some highlights. And I did that.
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:41.480]   And everybody kept coming over going like, did you just do that? And I was like, yeah,
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.900]   I don't know how, but it's very cartoony still. He's doing a very realistic Mick Jagger.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:55.600]   Look how real that is. And you're just watching and he doesn't teach you anything. So he just starts
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.680]   painting. So this is the photo he had as a reference, but then this is his painting.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.860]   Right. And because I'm there, he's not teaching you how to paint.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:05.980]   Through osmosis, you're like learning some of-
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:07.640]   You're seeing that there isn't a trick.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.200]   I thought he had a trick and that's why I couldn't get any further. He's using the same brush and the
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.500]   same paint. Well, how come I can't do that? And you go, you do it. I go, I'm going to try and do
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:21.720]   something realistic. I've never done realistic before because I'm a cartoonist and everything, I was
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:27.360]   cartoony. And that was just easier for me because I thought I would need too much training. I did
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.680]   another Trejo. I started doing a realistic. I finished out just one section of his face
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.040]   and put the pen down because I did that the same day.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.080]   Nice.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:43.760]   I got out of my way because seeing him get out of his own way, I think that's why sometimes people
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.380]   need to go to school for stuff like that. Because then now, well, I just did four years of school.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.300]   So now I must know. Now you've given yourself permission, but you could give yourself permission
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.800]   right away and it's going to come through.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:58.000]   And drawing Danny Trejo of all people, it's like, there's so much going on there. It's like,
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:58.880]   he's so expressive.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.540]   He's so expressive.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:05.900]   I mean, you've worked with him a lot and you've, I mean, he's one of those bad-ass humans on the
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:12.020]   screen. You've created that. Can you just talk about what it's like creating those characters?
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:16.340]   What was exciting about Desperados, I went to go make it and there were no Latin actors working in
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:21.360]   Hollywood because no one was creating roles for them. So I thought, wow, I got to go create my
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.460]   own stars. We'll bring Antonio from Europe because they kind of know his name from the Almodovar
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:30.740]   movies. And I saw him in Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down when I was in the hospital writing mariachi
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:37.220]   or watching TV while I was a patient. And there's a scene where he like headbutts Victoria Abril,
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:42.640]   you know, he just gave his headbutt, he goes, like that. And I was like, whoa, I bet that guy would
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:46.180]   want to be in an action movie. He's got something inside. So I called him when we were doing
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:50.300]   Desperado and I said, would you ever consider doing an action? Oh man, I'd love to do action.
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:56.040]   So I said, I got a movie for you. I got a movie for you. It was the sequel to mariachi. And so
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:03.040]   Salma, I found in Mexico television, you know, doing, she couldn't get work in the U.S. because
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.580]   the roles in her. Yeah, how did you find her? I mean, this is one of the greatest actors
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:11.060]   in the world. It was one of the best stories. I was really determined to hire a real Latin,
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:17.280]   especially Hispanic, and then she's Mexican actress to be the Mexican character. That's like as authentic
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:21.700]   as you can get. And there was no one who was getting any jobs because no one was creating any. So there
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:25.660]   was no one that had any movies under their name because there was no one. It was a whole systemic
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:34.400]   problem, right? This was 94, 93. So I was watching a Paul Rodriguez show on Univision
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.920]   because he, I was trying to practice my Spanish because I was having to do all these Spanish
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.840]   interviews because mariachi was in Spanish. That was the other part I didn't tell you.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:46.460]   I didn't speak Spanish when I made that movie. We didn't grow up with it. So I never, I left that
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:50.580]   part out of the mariachi story because I thought people already didn't believe I made the movie by
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:54.720]   myself. They knew I made it in a language I didn't speak. I should have said it because it'd be even
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:01.080]   more inspiring. Like now you have no excuse. I would wrote the English subtitles. Basically I
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:06.560]   wrote the titles, what became the subtitles. And then we take it to the actors and the actor would
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:13.020]   translate it for me. And I was like, I'd be like, holy, I would try to speak Spanish and say,
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:19.320]   like, let's record. And they'd be looking at me like, that means let's remember the record doesn't
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:24.500]   mean record. Now I know back then I didn't know. So I'm watching Univision.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:31.460]   And then there's Sama as a guest and she's a big soap star down there in Mexico. And she comes out,
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:37.000]   she's beautiful, she's funny, everyone's laughing. She's Sama, everyone that we know now. And she
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.340]   starts talking about, you know, what I gather from what she's saying that she's having trouble finding
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:46.080]   any work in the U.S. because of her accent. And then, uh, Parajiga said, well, say something in
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.100]   English. And then she says, she sounds just like she does now. And he goes, that's great. She goes,
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:56.040]   I know, I know. And I went, I think this is the girl. So I called her in my office and I videotaped
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.880]   our first meeting together. So I have that somewhere.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:52:59.780]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:06.520]   And it's Sama. It's Sama. It's her with her energy, with her passion. It's funny. She became instant
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:10.580]   friends with my wife, you know, before they walked over, your wife and I are best friends. She already
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:17.060]   was like part of the family. She's a godmother to my kids. Um, and I thought, I'm going to help you.
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:21.160]   You're going to help me. I need to have a Mexican actress in this and you're going to be phenomenal.
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:25.680]   The studio didn't see it. They were like, what? She hasn't done anything. Why don't you just hire
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:32.120]   somebody else who, you know, already has a name? So if we just give her one movie, then she'll be
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:35.900]   someone who's in a movie and then you can keep casting. So I made a whole mother movie with her
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:40.520]   in English called Road Racers. It was my second film for Showtime. Really cool little rebel without a
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:45.500]   cause type movie. Um, and she's, and I gave her a role in that. So we'd have an example of her doing
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:51.380]   English and they still were like, we need a screen test. We need to have a screen test with
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:56.900]   a bunch of other actresses, you know? So I said, sure, let's do that. So I went over to her house
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:03.600]   the night before, before the screen test. And we worked on the scene, which is the best scene
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:07.760]   where she's operating on his arm and they've got all this chemistry. And I was just directing her
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.040]   through it, like completely down to when you pick up the water and you hand him the water,
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:16.480]   don't scream. Oh, hot water. Just be like hot water. And while he's spitting it out and it's
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.860]   going to be a big dramatic action with like a very light delivery. And so we got it down to a science.
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:25.820]   The next day we show up, Antonio does a scene with all the girls come in.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:35.520]   He does it with her. Clearly they've got amazing chemistry. She just nails it. He's great. He loves
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:43.280]   the studio. And he's like, okay, you can hire. Reluctantly like that, right? But once they saw the footage
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.880]   come as we're shooting and they saw it on the big screen when they're watching the dailies, then they
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:53.360]   were like, oh my God. And then they saw it. Then they saw what I saw when I met her. But sometimes,
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.540]   like you say, what do you do when people are like, hey, why come you're using these? Just know that not
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:03.880]   everyone's going to see it. You may have the only vision. Just keep going. There's an instinct that
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:08.340]   tells you to keep going that way. You'll get proved right or wrong, or maybe you're slipping on the
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:12.980]   first two rocks or whatever, but follow your instinct because you can, everyone's going to have an
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:18.120]   opinion and it's not necessarily the right one. And when you're an independent filmmaker, you can make
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:23.800]   those decisions to change people's careers, that changes the world. And that's why you want to remain
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.820]   independent. That's why what's happening now in the industry is great because I have to make movies
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:33.260]   like the way I started, which is what I've always liked to do, which is just doing it where we create
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:36.540]   our own destiny. We go, hey, we're going to make a movie. We're going to make it for this budget so we
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:40.220]   can make it. And the story is going to be so character driven and cool. We're going to be able to get big
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:43.800]   actors to be in it because they're going to want to be in it. So Danny Trejo, you asked me about Danny
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.020]   Trejo. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Danny Trejo. We're doing Desperado now. I'm casting all kinds of
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:53.280]   people. Now I have this character that I want to have a bunch of knives. He opens up his vest and there's a bunch
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:00.160]   of knives. So bring me all the coolest looking, you know, Latin actors we can find. And before he even
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:05.340]   walked in, there's a picture of him. He already looked like the guy, but he was younger. He always just
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:10.720]   played prison inmates. It was a picture of him as an inmate in a prison. I want to give him a cool role, you
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.480]   know, just wherever this actor is. He walks in and I see him. It's Danny Trejo. He sits down and I had the prop
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:22.120]   knife already made. And I say, you need to have this in your hand and look like you sleep with it.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:27.040]   Like just practice flipping it around your hand. And I gave it to him. You got the role. Just start
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.900]   practicing with that. And he gets up and walks out. He didn't have to say anything because there's no
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:35.960]   dialogue. He walks up. We get to the set and he kept saying, put me in coach. Give me a line. Give
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:39.280]   me a line. It's like, no, no, you're such a nice guy. You're going to blow the whole mystique. I want this
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.500]   guy to feel like the most evil, scary guy of all. And you're such a nice guy. I didn't let him talk
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:49.980]   till dusk till dawn. But one thing I noticed was that the town we were shot in, the Mexican town,
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:54.280]   which is the same town I shot Mariachi. We went back there because I wanted to pay back the city.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:57:00.280]   And so we had this big movie there and they didn't really know Antonio because he was in European
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:06.360]   movies. Salmo hadn't come to the set yet, but they saw Danny Trejo there in his vest looking like a
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:13.940]   Mexican icon. They would go like this. Everyone thought he was the star. And I just know magnetism
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:20.160]   when I see it. And I went, this guy's got something. So I went to him and I said, I got a movie we're
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:26.280]   going to do someday. This was 94. We didn't make this movie for 15 years. Machete. You're going to be
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:32.100]   Machete. I had, I had an idea for Machete then. It wasn't the same story. I had seen a story.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:37.220]   Actually, Mariachi, the guy from March sent me this funny story. He said, Hey, look at this story
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:45.440]   that the USDA and FBI sometimes would hire a Mexican federal to come do a job for 25 grand that they
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.740]   didn't want to get their own guys killed on. I said, that's Machete, the guy that they pay.
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:56.020]   But he's not doing it for the money. It turns out he has to get this guy that escaped Mexico. And
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:58.900]   that's the twist. So that was the original story I had. I said, we're going to do this someday.
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:04.180]   And we talked about it for years and never did it. Never had got around to doing it. So when I did
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:09.280]   Spy Kids, I put him in Spy Kids and I said, Hey, let's pay tribute to that character we never got to
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:15.020]   make. And you'll be uncle Machete. He's a gadget guy, but he's got a mysterious past. But then a few
[01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:19.720]   years later, Quentin and I were doing Grindhouse and he'd already done Dustal Dahl with me. You know,
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:24.200]   I was building my own Latin star system. Salmo showed up in a bunch of my movies. Cheech shows up in
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.940]   every movie. Danny shows up. I brought Cheech out of retirement and put him in my movie. I needed to
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:32.400]   create my own Latin star system because all my scripts, because when you write in your own voice,
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:36.800]   you're going to write probably somebody that's Latin, you know, so you need to have a star system
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:40.280]   that matches that so that you don't have trouble casting and people are like, well, you can't hire
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:45.760]   this person. So I built up my own star system. So Danny was one of my stars. So after we're doing
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:53.300]   Grindhouse, we had to do fake trailers for Grindhouse. And I told Quentin, I know what trailer I'm going to do
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:57.500]   for the movie I never got to make with Danny called Machete. That'll be so fun. Finally get
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:02.680]   that out of our system. And doing a trailer is so fun. It's two days of shooting. Just still being
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:07.720]   that resourceful guy. We asked this company that had a digital camera we wanted to use. Can you let us
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:11.980]   send it to us for a couple of days screen test? I mean, camera test. Instead of shooting a camera
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:16.460]   test, we shot the trailer. So we got a free camera, shot the trailer with him. And it's just the money
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:21.500]   shots, him opening his vest full of machetes, you know, him aiming that gun, him in a waterfall with
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:28.540]   two gals. And I just came up with this really funny trailer and we shot it. People were screaming at
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:33.920]   the premiere. You couldn't even hear it. They just wanted that movie so badly because there was
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.640]   blaxploitation in the seventies. There was never mexploitation. It felt like this should have
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:42.000]   existed, but it didn't. It's Mexican superhero. They just never seen anything like that. You know,
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.460]   now, you know, but like even his mom calls him a shame. Like he just became this guy. And I've
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:53.460]   saw 250 movies that he's been in. Machete is his most famous one. So for five years,
[01:59:53.460 --> 02:00:01.140]   five years, people would come up to us and say, where's Machete? Why aren't you? Where's the,
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:05.180]   when's that movie coming out? We're like, it's not a real movie, but when it looks real, we want to see
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:10.900]   that movie. So we finally made the movie because people just asked for it. And I used, I wanted to,
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:15.320]   I was adamant about being resourceful again. All those shots that are in the trailer are really
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:20.820]   great. I got to reverse engineer the trailer into a movie so that I can use that shot that's in the
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:24.720]   trailer. Like this girl in the waterfall. Why would this girl be in the waterfall? I don't have a really
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:28.560]   clever way that he gets the bad guy. Her hair's kind of, her face is kind of covered by this hair.
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:34.060]   We'll cast Lindsay Lohan there or the Senator will switch it out for Robert De Niro. Well, I just
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:39.360]   reverse engineered it. So every time there's a shot in the trailer, it's in the movie, but I shot all the
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:43.320]   footage around to lead up to it. That's another fun, creative exercise is to reverse engineer
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:47.880]   something. You just did like this on the day. You just threw a bunch of cards out basically with
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.520]   that trailer. And now you got to go make a movie using all those cards. That's like a creative
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:57.800]   exercise that I thought so satisfying. So fun. Yeah, that was beautiful. You're, you're actually
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:03.180]   known in part, maybe you can correct me, but to do pretty unexpected, surprising, kind of interesting
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:08.980]   casting. So Robert De Niro is an example of that. And that's just a great role. The second aspect of
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.800]   that I heard the story that you can just get an actor in and out in just a few days,
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:18.060]   really fast. The, the, the Robert Rodriguez experiences they call it. How do you make that
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:22.220]   happen? Like, can you just tell the story? Well, I'm the editor, I'm the cameraman, I'm the DP.
[02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:30.500]   And so when I call him and say, I've got you as the villain in this whole movie, but I'm going to,
[02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:34.780]   I swear, I'm going to shoot you on four days. You come down four days. Like there's a scene where
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:38.640]   he's in the hospital. He's just smiling. He's having such a good time. Cause he couldn't believe it. I said,
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:42.960]   guess what? When you wake up from your hotel room at the Stephen F. Austin, you just crossed the
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.860]   hallway. That's the set. The room, the room next to yours, we turned into the hospital set. So you're
[02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:51.200]   just going to come laying there in your pajamas. Really? That's what you did? Well, yeah, we had
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.800]   to save time. We only have four days. So everything had to be very thought out to be like, boom,
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.560]   boom, boom, let's shoot the money, get him out of this. We don't have to spend a lot of money on him.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:01.620]   Book a room in a hotel set up to look like a hospital room.
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:04.780]   Yeah. That's our set. And it's real. You don't have to dress it. And it's just right there.
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:09.660]   All you do is put like a little tube there, you know, like a, for his IV. And then you have a
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.640]   couple of nurses and it looks like. Just genius. It was Robert De Niro. Resourceful, resourceful.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:17.880]   Next door. But, uh, I said, you're going to think about me when you're on your next
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:22.080]   meet the Fockers movie and you're on there for six months where they have you sitting in a trailer.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.200]   I don't like to do that. So, you know, I gave Lady Gaga her first two movies
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:33.880]   because, um, after Machete, she said publicly, she said, I saw Machete and my song Americano should
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.600]   have been in Machete. I thought she saw Machete. So I called her up and I said, Hey, I'm making a
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.120]   sequel and I would certainly use your music. But have you ever thought about acting? Cause you're
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.660]   an amazing performer. I think you'd be, I've worked with a lot of actors who are also musicians and
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:49.080]   they're always great. Cause I already know how to be a persona, be on stage, be in front of a bunch
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.400]   of people, which most actors can't do. And she said, actually, I studied acting before I became a
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:57.020]   singer. So, well, you'll never be able to be in a movie because you know what? They don't
[02:02:57.020 --> 02:03:02.180]   know how to shoot people out. They want six months of your time and you've got, and you're always on
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:08.240]   tour, but if you come be here, I have a part for you. I can shoot you out in half a day, this whole
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.820]   section of a movie and I'll shoot your movie poster. She's like, okay. So she shows up. I had all the
[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:17.000]   sets, like a conveyor belt right next to each other. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. She's in the car.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.280]   That's why she had me do her music video for rain on me later. She said, we should just go to
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:25.560]   Austin. Robert put me on a grease. I was throughout that whole movie. I don't know how we did that.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:30.840]   It was half a day. She was there half a day. I did the same for Sin City too. I was like, I have a set
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:35.280]   here waiting for you. If you're on tour in Houston, just drive into Austin. I'll shoot you out in half
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.040]   a day. You could be in a scene with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Sure. She came down.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.420]   So wait, how do you take Robert De Niro? How do you take Lady Gaga and like solve the puzzle of all
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:48.400]   the scenes that have to be in? How do we shoot them quickly, efficiently, conveniently?
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:54.460]   You have to edit your own movie. I have this analogy, a food analogy that works really well.
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:04:01.040]   Script is like your grocery list. Filming is like grocery shopping, getting the best performances,
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:08.600]   getting the best beat, getting the best ingredients, right? Editing is like the cooking. Too much of
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:12.560]   this and not enough of that. You fuck the whole thing up. So there's so many filmmakers do not edit.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:17.740]   And they give it to some other guy who might look at all your ingredients and go, well, this is all
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:24.240]   great, but I'm going to go make a fucking souffle. And he makes something else. So by doing that job,
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:28.080]   I mean, like I've worked on some big stuff and I realized finally after many years, because I've
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:34.660]   always edited, I realized this is why movies cost so much. There could be 150, 200 people on the crew.
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:39.880]   And I swear not one of them knows how to edit, not one. So they're getting the wrong stuff. They're
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:45.560]   having to reshoot shit. The editor is in a room somewhere useless calling after the fact. We still
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.540]   need to get this closeup, but you got to reshoot that because it doesn't match because no one knows
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:58.140]   editing. So if you just know that you're already miles ahead of 99% of Hollywood, but that's just how
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:03.440]   I learned by accident. So I kind of stumbled upon it. But, um, and I realized that's what the problem
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:07.940]   is because across the board, I'm watching them going, that's not going to match. You guys are
[02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:12.800]   just spending money, sending crews out, shooting stuff for this. It's just, it's a clusterfuck.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:17.940]   Let me show you. And that's how it's in city. Bruce Willis, nine days. Well,
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:23.420]   Brittany Murphy's in all three stories, one day, Benicio Latoro, three days. It's just like,
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:28.140]   you're just shooting this stuff. Mickey Rourke is in a sequence with Rudger Hauer. We shot eight
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:33.100]   months apart. I didn't have Rudger Hauer until I was doing Sharkboy and Lavagirl. So I just shot
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:36.020]   Mickey acting with me and then I shot Rudger acting with me and I just cut them together.
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:40.960]   What's weird is like editing exercises or like I used to do these editing exercises where I would
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:45.260]   do my VCRs together and I would cut my movies, but sometimes I would just cut a music video and I
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:49.180]   cut a music video once because I was a big fan of Rudger Hauer and a big fan of Mickey Rourke.
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:52.700]   So I said, I want to make it look like they're in a movie together. So I cut this music video
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:57.700]   together. But, and so it shows like lightning on Rudger and the hitcher and then lightning on
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:02.900]   Mickey from Rumblefish, but Rumblefish is black and white. So I made the whole thing black and
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:07.940]   white. I was like 19, I was 19 years old when I did that. And then years later, I'm making Sin City.
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:12.100]   I shot Mickey not knowing who the other actor was going to be until I cast him eight months later and
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:15.940]   it was Rudger. I'm cutting them together to look like they're in the same movie and it's in black and
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:22.180]   white. And I'm like, I've done this before. Oh my God. I found that old video. It's like,
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:25.540]   oh my God, I already made a movie with him in black and white. That's some weird shit, right?
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:31.940]   That's the magic of creativity. It's like sometimes when you have a vision, it's not clear, but it's
[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:37.180]   coming to you from the future. So you got to just follow the voice. No matter what anyone says about
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:42.560]   your curtains, just follow the voice you got in your head because you don't know and you're not smart
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:47.900]   enough to know. And you don't need to know. You just need to do, you just need to be the hands.
[02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:54.400]   So this is like what you can do with no time or money. When you know all those jobs, it's the
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:58.500]   benefit of knowing those jobs. Like I said, the more, you know, those jobs, the more, you know,
[02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:04.180]   your main job, which is being creative, but on the day thinking on your feet. So I'm going to show you
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:10.160]   this, um, this test. Okay. So for Nestled on the TV series, I would always shoot the first episode
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.460]   in the last episode of like a seven or eight episode season. There's three seasons.
[02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:21.160]   By the time we got to the third season, I was doing Alita, so I couldn't do the big finale episode.
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:26.700]   And my actor who plays the George Clooney character, DJ Catrona, he's somebody who fucking wanted to be a
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:30.720]   writer, was writing. He's wrote Fight and Flight. This is a movie that's going to come out with Josh
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.560]   Arnett. That's his, he wrote it. And after doing this, he was like, man, hearing you talk, you know
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.640]   what I got, this is what I love about you inspire people. The feedback loop inspires you back. He
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:45.340]   said, man, hearing your talk for red 11 and the cards and, uh, I've got a script that's partially
[02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:49.760]   written. I'm just going to go, I'm going to go crank it out in 3d. I'm going to cut off the phone
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:53.560]   in 3d. I'm going to finish that thing in three fucking days. And he came back and he said, I
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:57.940]   finished the script and I read it and I go, when you read it in three days and go, well, I wrote
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:02.660]   something before, but I just kept thinking I wasn't ready. And then you told me the thing about not
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:05.900]   being ready. And you said that it really resonated. I went and I finished it in three days. I go,
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:10.000]   man, I'm going to do that. I'm going to go do the DJ method. I call the DJ method. I have a bunch of
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.480]   half-baked ideas that I'm just going to go turn off the phone and finish the thing in three days and
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.720]   I'll fix it later. But the three days, there's going to be pure pipe. It's just going to be coming
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.380]   through. Cause you're just going to be picking up the pen. So anyway, he went, he came to me with
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.740]   this idea. He said, Oh man, I was hoping you'd do the last episode of just till dawn. Cause I had
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:32.080]   this great idea for a scene. We're in a zombie town, Western town. We have those ones, those guns
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:36.480]   where you have to pull the trigger, you know, the hammer back before you can fire. So I thought,
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.860]   what if I have a gun that's empty and I got bullets in the other hand and I bump into a zombie,
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:45.440]   the bullets go flying. I jump and I catch all the bullets and shoot the guy before I hit the ground.
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:49.340]   Okay. That's kind of like a real cool, like desperado type thing, but dude,
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:56.200]   this is a seven day shoot for these episodes. Every one of the crew will have a different idea
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:01.380]   on how to do that. Stunt guy will put you on wires cause you have to do all that action or
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:07.040]   the DP isn't even operating the camera. It's a camera guy. The director doesn't know how to shoot.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:14.460]   He's not operating the camera. Your editors in a room somewhere, VFX guys aren't there. You're not
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:19.020]   going to be able to ask them how to do it. But I, in my own VFX, I came up with how we did all the
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:24.880]   shots and Sid City and all those spiking movies. We need one guy to come do it. I'll come do it for
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:29.120]   you. I'll come do it. Cause I'm already going to be there. Cause I have to shoot a second unit fight
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:31.980]   scene for the other actor who wanted a cool fight scene. So I was already doing that.
[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:36.060]   When it comes to your scene, we'll switch places because it's got to be done quick. Cause you've
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.480]   got, you got to shoot it in 20 minutes. Cause you've got a ton of other shit. You got to shoot
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:43.440]   and you'll just never get it. You won't even get it in a film schedule, you know,
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:48.280]   in a regular movie schedule. It's just too crazy. You need somebody with a vision to do the whole
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.440]   scene. So this is what it would look like if you're on the set. I'm going to show you the
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:55.500]   footage and I'm going to show you the scene. I have to show it to you a couple of times.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:10:00.300]   Cause you're not going to believe what you're about to see. So if you were on the set, this
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:03.920]   is what it would look like. So I get there, they said, we're ready for that scene. So I get over
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.500]   there to the set and I go, okay, where, where are you coming out of this building? Where are you
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:14.520]   getting the bullets from that body? Okay. Bring that body closer. Okay. Stunt guy, bring a pad
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:19.120]   over. I want to see you just jump and start to twist as if you're turning. I just want to see
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.980]   how much airtime you can get to get any action before you hit the pad. He starts to jump. He's
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:26.460]   barely starts jumping. He's already hitting the pad. So I was like, okay, that ain't going to work.
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:30.720]   You get out of here, DJ, you're going to do it. I have no idea how I'm going to do this. I hadn't
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.560]   thought about it before, but now you're there. So awesome. And now the options are very limited.
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:37.660]   You're very limited. Look at the sun. You're going to see the sun not move. You see, that's the
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:42.360]   point where the sun starts getting lost. I have to shoot this in 20 minutes. You're going to do
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.660]   three jumps and I'm going to cut it to look like one jump. All the bullets are going to miss. The
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:51.660]   only one's going to go in. So here, just follow what I'm saying. We don't have time. What cameras
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:55.720]   do we have? What's on the A camera? A long lens. Oh yeah, that's my camera. I'll operate that. What's
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:01.240]   on the B camera? Steadicam. Leave it on steadicam. No chance, no time to convert it. At one point,
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:06.800]   I want to lower it. So just flip it upside down. We'll flop it later. Give me the main camera. Okay,
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:11.540]   DJ, start running towards that bullets and grab it and pretend like it gets shot out of your hand.
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:15.400]   I shoot it in slow motion, but I'm showing you how it would look on the set. Okay. Now the bullets are
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:18.360]   flying. I'm going to add those digitally and I'm going to hold the bullets up to the light
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:22.440]   in each angle so that they know what it's supposed to look like so they can match that. Otherwise,
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:30.700]   it'll look phony. Now, first jump. I just want you to commit to just jumping out and just look at the
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:34.900]   barrel. Just look at the barrel on your hands when you're jumping because that'll look like you're
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:39.780]   looking at the bullets. And just don't even think about that you're going to catch a bullet. Don't think
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:43.460]   about that you're going to start turning. Just stretch your body out. Get a really
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:48.320]   graphic. Look at how cool that looks. And then the side view, it's shot this at the same time.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:53.600]   You can already tell it's going to look like bullets are missing, right?
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:12:01.180]   Okay. Now I need this part though. I need the part where he's catching the bullet. This little window
[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:07.400]   there. How am I going to do that? With a lens that long, it's going to be all out of focus. It's not
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:11.180]   going to be slow motion enough. He even knows me and he's like, what the hell am I doing? So I just lay
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:17.320]   on the pad and rock up and down. And as you're coming down, that'll look like you're falling as I'm
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:21.980]   zooming in because I'm operating the camera and I'm cutting this in my head. Yeah. And I'm saying,
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:26.260]   just do it again. He's like, what is it? Rock up. And then as you go down, it's going to look like
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:31.740]   you're falling. Well done bullets. Okay. Well done. You've caught a bullet. One went in now. Second
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:37.260]   jump. When you do the next jump as if we just passed those other moments, you've caught a bullet
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:42.080]   already. So now you're going to snap it close and start your turn. It's all you'll get before you hit the
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:48.820]   pad. Snap turn. Right. So like, okay, this is, I want the cameras to feel like they're dropping
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:53.580]   with them. That'll give you more of the sensation. So let's actually lower that steady cam shot,
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:57.280]   flip it upside down and get a low angle. So yeah, look at the sun's right there. Hasn't gone behind
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:04.200]   the building yet. That. And then my camera, I lowered my camera down and I got that. Right. Okay. Now
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:10.200]   last jump. I bury a thin, I said, just bury me, bring me a thin mattress. Cause I want him to do
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:14.960]   all the stuns. I don't want a stunt guy. Cause he does this himself. He just did it in three
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:18.460]   jumps with the audience. No, they'll just be like, we believe that this guy can do anything.
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:25.760]   I want you just to finish by turning and cocking the hammer back and firing before you hit the
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:32.060]   ground. I'll give you two takes for that. Almost gets it there. Then we do a second take. Boom.
[02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:34.900]   Now that other one was probably a little better, even though you don't really see it.
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:39.380]   I've got to go do everything now. I got to cut it. I got to add the sound effects myself. I got to put
[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:42.580]   the music in myself because music guys would just end up filling it with music and ruin it.
[02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:46.360]   Sound effects guys would just fill it full of sound effects and ruin it. I want all the sound to drop
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:53.000]   out. So as he's jumping, all you hear is the wind. I mean, his jacket, the clinking of the bullets as
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:58.720]   they're bouncing off. So you have this breathless moment, no music, cut the music. And that moment you
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:04.920]   cut it so that you're like, I wonder if he's going to make it. Right. So I go home, I cut it before I
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:09.420]   even have the visual effects. And I just cut it that night because I cut my own sound effects.
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:13.960]   I cut my sound effects in. You can already tell it's going to work. You can already see when the
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:18.240]   bullets, not there, you can tell by the sound where they're going to be. It's going to work.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.040]   I call them up and say, dude, this is going to work great. So then I go to the effects guys and I go,
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.680]   okay, there's bullet in this frame. And the next frame is here. Cause I used to animate in the next
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.820]   frame. It's there. Then it hits the barrel and then it starts bouncing this way. I want it that clear
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:35.480]   so we can follow that a bullet was supposed to go in and that it bounced way over there. And then this
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:40.040]   bullet bounced way over there. And then they send it back and a bunch of bullets come down. No guys,
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:44.880]   listen to what I say. I'm going to show you again. I'm going to draw it to you again. Just the sound
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.740]   will play. Like there's multiple bullets flying. I don't need to see all those bullets or the eye's
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:53.880]   not going to know where to go. So then they got it right. Brilliant. And then check this out. I'm
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:13.700]   going to show it to you twice. Cause you're not going to believe it changes direction. Wow.
[02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:22.820]   Wow. Well done. You don't even see that in a feature film, much less a TV show.
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:25.140]   Well done. Just as a director. Well done.
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:29.320]   Oh, thank you. Here just one more time and I'll show you something you didn't notice both times.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:52.120]   That's amazing. Just those decisions coming together perfectly.
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:58.040]   Coming together. And like this, you got, you got minutes just, uh, moving the camera. Like you
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.940]   decided to do really work really well. The balancing of the mattress, whatever. And it's not like you
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:05.780]   have this whole plan figured out ahead. You're literally in the moment you're, it's coming through
[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:09.140]   you. But you're seeing it though, right? I'm seeing it because I've done it enough. That's why
[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:13.320]   you really want to learn all those jobs because it comes, it comes to a moment like this when the
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.580]   shit's fucking hitting the fan. You got to know how to pull it out. You could have gotten all those
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:20.800]   people together and they never would have figured that out. You had one person had to see it all the
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:24.520]   way through. You're seeing the bullet, how it's going to go in the, in the result. I've done enough
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:28.740]   times to know that if you don't do it just right, you're going to, you're going to lose the image. You're
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:32.240]   not going to know where to follow and you'll miss the point. And also, yeah, I love that you're
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:39.180]   thinking about where the eyes of the audience will go. And that's like, I feel like too many people
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:46.640]   might think about some more general concept of a scene versus like the audience, where's their eyes?
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:49.880]   Where's their eyes? Well, you're drawing, you're drawing it through sound, through picture. I'm going to
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:55.540]   show you. If you notice without the sound, you don't really see him clip that thing back.
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:17:00.900]   The sound is so central here. Watch this. You, you, you don't really. Right. I thought I saw it. You
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:05.380]   think you saw it, but you hear it. And so you feel like see, but watch it's actually, he's already
[02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:10.260]   finished. You don't really see him do it, you know, but you swear you saw it in a closeup because the
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:14.420]   sound is in a closeup. I put the sound in a closeup. Now here's another thing you didn't notice. He
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:21.780]   hits this ground in the first shot. Watch one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:25.460]   didn't even notice it because I didn't play the sound there. So if you don't hear
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:30.580]   it, you don't see it. And if you don't see it, but you play a sound, you hear it, then you see it in
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:35.940]   your mind. Right. So check that out now with the sound on, and you'll see both those parts play
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:50.420]   completely different. Right. Now you hear it. See, I know you can get away with that because I know
[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:54.420]   editing and I'm like, if I don't play a sound, I can go ahead and milk that shot as long as I want. I'll make
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:58.100]   him be in the air longer, even though he's actually touching the ground by not playing
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:18:03.140]   the sound. And that comes from, you said directing, but it's not directing. Like people can direct and
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:09.140]   say, this is what I want, but to actually execute it, you need to be a craftsman. And to be a craftsman,
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:12.900]   you have to learn all those crafts. And not just with the visuals, but with the sound.
[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:18.740]   The sound too. Sound is so important. Sound is half the picture. Sound. And if you cut sound,
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:23.940]   you realize how important sound is. I would learn so much by doing those movies, like Desperado action
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:28.100]   movies where you go, wow, the sound, I can add an extra sound effect of an extra punch. He didn't
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:33.060]   even throw. And it sounds like he's beating the shit out of this guy. And you only need to see one or two
[02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:36.580]   hits and you can hear five, you know, you know, you know where you can push your limits because you've
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:40.180]   done it. You've done it and you've got the experience. It's so amazing that you can use
[02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:45.780]   sound to make a person believe they saw something that wasn't actually there on the screen. Yeah.
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:50.100]   Your brain fills it in. That's crazy. And that's why that's so important because if you don't know
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:54.180]   that you'll be on the set shooting 10 takes of that because you're like, no, he didn't, you know,
[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:58.500]   I didn't see him click it back. He didn't see, I didn't see him click it back. That's really needed.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:01.380]   I can do that with sound. Let's just go. Let's just keep moving.
[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:03.380]   When you say sound close up, what does that mean?
[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:07.060]   The sound, all the other sound dropped away and all you hear is like the sound,
[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:13.940]   like the mic's right on that thing so that you hear it so big in your ear that you swear it was
[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:18.340]   in closeup too, but just the sound was close. How do you, uh, sorry, just to give an insight into
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:25.220]   like that process of sound design, what are you, uh, like listening to the sound and just like
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:29.460]   experiencing the feeling that creates. And then you're like, that's just right.
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:33.940]   Lane and post a lot. So I have a whole library of sound effects from all my movies.
[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:38.500]   So I can pull up like the gun sound we created for Bruce Willis and Sensity and use that and mix it
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:43.860]   with Antonio's gun from Desperado. You know, I remember in four rooms, there's a scene where
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:50.260]   the bellhop goes into the hotel room, jams his key into it and clicks it. And I used all gun
[02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:54.420]   sounds for the sounds of the key instead of key sounds. Cause it wasn't sound close up enough.
[02:19:54.420 --> 02:20:00.340]   So if you listen to it, you hear like, uh, all these sounds from gun to do the key is it's like,
[02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:04.340]   that conveys the sound better. You know, I'll use different kinds of sounds that just have impact
[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:08.500]   and put it somewhere like when he hits the ground or, so I like playing with all that
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:13.780]   in posts when I'm editing, because it makes my editing job easier. Sometimes it's like, oh,
[02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:18.420]   the sound is covering me. I don't, I don't need to keep trying to massage this. The sound is actually
[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:23.140]   selling it. And so I keep those sound effects into the final movie. So it's just all part of
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:26.340]   necessary. It's like, it's like being a chef. You're there cooking and you're going like,
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.900]   I know the recipe says this, but I think it really could use jalapenos and some extra
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:34.260]   pepper and maybe a little more salt. And then it needs an acid of some kind. So I'm going to add
[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:37.700]   some lemon juice. Yeah. You made me realize, I'm not sure where I saw that, but you were,
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:44.100]   you were talking about making sort of almost like home films for fun. And I think you mentioned how
[02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:48.020]   exciting you can make a very mundane scene by just adding sound.
[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:52.260]   Yeah. There was, I think there was like a little kid for this car. Yeah. One of those little
[02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:57.780]   and, but I added a motor sound to it. And it's like, wow, it sounds realistic somehow. Like,
[02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:00.820]   I don't understand what my brain is doing. And then we're playing with these little cars,
[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:05.860]   filming ourselves playing with the cars, but then I replaced it with real car sounds.
[02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:11.940]   And it just, your brain links the reality of the real thing. It's crazy.
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:16.260]   And you realize how unimportant the visual is and how important the sound is actually.
[02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:20.580]   Sound is everything. That's what I was really lucky in Mariachi that my camera didn't work
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:25.540]   for sound. Cause then I got really good sound that I would have gotten with a shitty mic out of frame,
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:28.820]   because that's the first telltale sign of a low budget movie is bad sound,
[02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:34.100]   bad sound right away. You can already hear all this hiss and all this mic was too far. And you're like,
[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:38.740]   low budget movie before your eyes even tell you the sound gives it away. Isn't that amazing?
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:45.380]   The audio is first. Sound is first really, even though it's a visual medium. That's so crazy.
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:53.220]   Uh, just on the, what's the plan with the, with the four action films? Like what, what, what are the next
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:57.140]   steps? I'll probably direct more than one. Cause there's already several that I want to do, but I was,
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:00.980]   I'm going to direct at least one, but I'm producing all three, all four there at my studio.
[02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:05.780]   It does draw you in. It draws you in and it makes you go now think of ideas you never would have
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:11.460]   thought of for mainly because it has a filter. Well, now I don't have to think of all these ideas.
[02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:16.100]   I can only, I actually have like that, like me on that set, there's only very few things I can actually
[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:20.500]   come up with that are just action driven. First, when I have a great character, you'll get to it a lot
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:26.340]   faster with a filter. That's the beauty of a filter is that now you've just shrunk your, your target.
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:30.820]   And now you can hit that target and people are coming up with ideas because now they've got
[02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:35.220]   proximity and they've got a reason to come up with the idea. And they've got a deadline, which is the
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:40.260]   best thing you can do is have a deadline because when you have a deadline, you can freaking move
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:46.740]   mountains. You know, I had a spy kids in the theater every year, three years in a row, not being pre-planned
[02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:52.340]   every year. There was a spy kids. Now the third one was the biggest one, biggest cast, mostly green
[02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:58.180]   screen, video game, and the first digital 3d movie ever. So getting visual effects companies
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:03.380]   to make that, we realized, oh, I shot it with two cameras. That means each effect shot has to be done
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:09.460]   twice from a different angle. So I went to the studio midway through that and said, there's not going to
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:14.580]   be a movie in the theaters in time. You're going to have to push the date back. And they said, okay,
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:19.860]   we've never heard you panic. We'll push the date back for you. They called back 10 minutes later.
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:22.500]   I was like, oh, thank God, because it's really complicated. I didn't know it was going to be
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:27.620]   this complicated, but I wanted a challenge. And they said, McDonald's will sue us for $20
[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:32.500]   million if you move the date. You have to have a movie in the theater. We started shooting that movie
[02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:41.700]   in January of 2003. It was in 3d in theaters by July. That's the fastest any effects movie has ever
[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:48.900]   been done because you had no choice. So deadline makes you do things and make decisions really quick.
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:54.340]   And it was the biggest of the three. Deadlines are good. And it's hard for us to self-impose a
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:58.100]   deadline sometimes because we know it's a bullshit deadline and your brain knows it's a bullshit.
[02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:02.660]   But why do deadlines work? Because when the deadline's coming up, what do you do?
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:09.700]   You start to put the pen to the paper and it starts just flowing, right?
[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:15.860]   You have no choice. You have to get out of the way and open the pipe and it just comes out and you're
[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:18.580]   shocked. You're like, oh my God, I should do everything at the last minute. Well, no,
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:23.700]   you don't have to. But if you just learn how to open that pipe earlier, you wouldn't be in a rush,
[02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:28.020]   but you had to get out of your way because your deadline was up and you had to come up with it.
[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:31.860]   So many people are going to come up with all these extra great ideas at the last minute.
[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:38.100]   But it looks like everyone who's already signing on, because it's cool they don't know when the
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:42.340]   deadline is. They keep writing in saying, when is the deadline for this? And we say, well, when we
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:47.860]   close the funding in May. But we didn't say when still. So I think that gives them a sense of a
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:52.660]   deadline like, shit, it might be May 1st or maybe May 2nd, so we better get my idea going. So I think
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:56.980]   it works in your favor because then you come up with stuff. And you're going to feel so enriched by
[02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:01.140]   doing the idea that you're not going to care if it gets picked or not. You're going to love this idea
[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:05.780]   so much. It could turn into 10 other things you never even thought about. That's the beauty of
[02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:10.500]   doing a project. Nothing ever goes to waste. So many ideas that were sitting around that I'd come up
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:16.180]   with and put a lot of time in are now like, oh, I can do these now. I have, I know how to finish it now.
[02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:22.020]   I have to ask you about Alita. So you've done so many incredibly innovative projects. This is one of
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:26.020]   them. It turned out to be this visual masterpiece. There's a bunch of complexity,
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:31.300]   beautiful complexity about it in that it started out as a film that James Cameron was supposed to
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:36.820]   make. And then you started to collaborate with him on it. And these two, I would say brilliant
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:42.420]   directors, but with different styles, like you were talking about. And so, plus there's the complexity of,
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:48.900]   for people who haven't seen it, you're putting this artificial creation, this beautiful,
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:56.500]   photorealistic, artificial creation of a human being into a real world. So you have to capture
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:26:02.180]   the performance, not just the motion, but the performance of this actor, put them into this,
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:07.700]   with the power of technology, into the real world to convey all the emotion, the richness of the human
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:10.900]   face. Can you just speak to the process of bringing that world to life?
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:14.900]   Sure. I mean, why not? I never would have attempted if it wasn't Jim, because Jim has
[02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:20.340]   figured all this out. So just to get you, again, remember, like I said, hey Jim, I'm operating a study
[02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:24.100]   can. What do you think of that? Well, I'm designing a new system. That's always how it is between him and I.
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:29.780]   So when I went to show him Desperado and it was done, he said, you might not want to sit through,
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:32.260]   if you don't want to sit through it while I'm watching it, it's fine. Do you want to read
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:37.300]   any of my scriptments, my treatment scripts, you know, called scriptments? I said, sure. He goes,
[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:44.900]   I have Spider-Man and I got Avatar. So this was in '95, he was showing me the scriptment for Avatar,
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:51.860]   which there was no technology for that. He was already doing stuff that didn't exist.
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:52.740]   Yeah.
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:56.100]   And I was reading it going like, it's a great story. And he's like, I don't know how the
[02:26:56.100 --> 02:27:00.100]   fuck he's going to do this. It's impossible. It's not even, he'd just done, you know,
[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:03.300]   Terminator 2 a few years before. It's like, that was the thing of the art.
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:11.060]   So Alita was going to be the movie he did first to prepare for Avatar. And so he had already done
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:17.140]   some prep work on it. It was based on a manga. But before they did that, they just started doing
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:22.100]   some tests for Avatar. And then as they got deeper into the test for Avatar to prepare for Alita,
[02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:27.780]   they went, I guess we're making Avatar first. So Alita got kind of pushed to the side and they
[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:32.020]   ended up doing it, which ended up becoming such a journey to make that movie, to get the technology,
[02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:36.260]   to build it, to make it. Because I remember visiting him on the set. I mean, I've known him so long.
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:40.500]   I was on the set of Titanic. That's how long I've been around this guy. I was on the set of Titanic.
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:45.460]   I was on the set with Sarah Connor and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Eddie Furlong for the 3D
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:50.580]   ride he made for Universal a few years later. So, I mean, I feel like I've been around him
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:57.380]   a lot of his career. And to be able to visit the set, you know, of Avatar and remember him
[02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:03.620]   showing me, like, artwork they did. Very photorealistic. And he goes, "I'm curious to
[02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:08.420]   see how photoreal it'll be when we're finally done with this process." Because you don't get to see it
[02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:14.100]   until it's almost done. And I was like, "Wow, he's just shooting blind. He's really..." Talk about me
[02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:18.100]   shooting mariachi, not seeing the footage. He's making this whole movie not even knowing what the end
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:22.740]   result's going to look like at all. Because you're not going to know till you get there. And when you
[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:28.180]   get there, if you don't like it, there's not a lot you can do. So, just seeing him do that and have
[02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:32.740]   that success really made it easier for me to do Alita. Because then it's like, "Okay, we don't know."
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:37.780]   Again, we don't need to know. We know we'll get there, but we don't know how we're going to do it.
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:43.060]   We're going to start. And anything that I would come up with on this movie and his team, because he had
[02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:48.900]   all his weather people working on it, he had them all working on it too. I'd do a fast version of his
[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:55.300]   process because it's a lot of live action. Avatar's mostly CG. I have live action sets. You have to come
[02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:58.420]   to my studio because I still have the whole Alita city in my back lot.
[02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:00.180]   Well, here at the Troublemaker studio?
[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:00.740]   Yeah.
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:01.540]   That's where it was...
[02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:06.260]   Yeah, it was shot here. So, when you go see my city, I built it very resourceful.
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:11.060]   This is weird. It looks just like The Town for Mariachi, but it's in my backyard. I'm like,
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.660]   "It looks better than The Town for Mariachi."
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:13.220]   Yeah.
[02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:18.100]   90,000. It's the largest standing set in the country because sets are always mowed down for
[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:22.100]   the next movie, but I just kept it there. So, we used to shoot it all the time for Mexico or South
[02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:28.740]   America or Europe or whatever. It's seven streets and we add it digitally above it. The ceilings are
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:33.220]   20 feet high. You got to come see. You don't believe that it's here. It's unbelievable.
[02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:34.580]   Where is it north of Austin?
[02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:39.300]   It's where the old airport was. So, it's on 51st Street. It's really close to town.
[02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:40.100]   I would love to visit.
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:44.100]   You got to come see. You're not going to believe it. All my props, all my stuff from all my movies.
[02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:49.140]   So, people who are investing in brass knuckle, that's why they say it's like a Willy Wonka movie
[02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:54.260]   because they're going to get to come check out all that stuff and be in proximity and see,
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:30:00.500]   Oh, like me with that painter. It's not a trick. He's just doing it. Then you realize you can do it too.
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:06.820]   But, um, we thought let's shoot mostly live action and we'll just replace her, but we still have to
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:11.860]   figure her out. You have to cast the right actress. And when I saw Rosa Salazar, she was just amazing.
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:16.020]   She made me cry in audition for the first time. I was like, Oh my God, this person has some, if we can
[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:22.980]   capture even a, a fourth of her facial expression, it'll bring so much life. And they got it one-to-one
[02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:30.340]   and, uh, it really helped Jim on the next Avatar and Weta because they got to try out a bunch of
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:36.100]   things. That's why Avatar, the second Avatar way of water looks so much more refined than the first
[02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:39.940]   Avatar because of that middle step of doing Alita. It was training ground for them.
[02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:44.740]   Can you actually educate me on the Weta process? Is this like a, a performance capture technology?
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:50.820]   Yeah, we have her in a suit for capturing her body movements, but also facial capture. It's a
[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:56.020]   performance capture of all her performance, all her emoting. And we have witness cameras around
[02:30:56.020 --> 02:31:00.660]   everywhere to pick up where she is and everything else is real. And we're just replacing her,
[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:04.580]   but with someone even smaller in size. So you have to erase everything behind her.
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:08.660]   There's like a bunch of technical things you do, but the idea is to whatever performance she gives,
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:14.420]   she's such a great actress is to capture all of that. Cause then this character that doesn't even exist
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:20.180]   will feel very emotional. And you have to, you have to be tied to it. You have to feel its heart.
[02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:21.220]   She was the heartbeat of it.
[02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:24.340]   So she's acting with all this, acting with all that, but it just disappeared. You know,
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:27.940]   she's not even, it's like, it's not even there. Like we don't notice that this is here. It's like
[02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:32.580]   that she can just perform through it. What was some interesting, unique, challenging things about
[02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:37.460]   you directing her performance in this, in this kind of world?
[02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:42.020]   I just, I just knew she had to be her. It was going to be just so easy with her. She's just so great.
[02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:46.660]   She, everything was just so real and everything was just like, she's that character. She becomes that
[02:31:46.660 --> 02:31:51.380]   character who's seen this world for the first time. No special effects going to help you with that.
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:55.780]   If the performance isn't there. So it was all about getting the performance and casting the right
[02:31:55.780 --> 02:32:01.220]   actors. That's why you get Christoph Waltz there and you get Jennifer Connelly, you know, these masters
[02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:09.700]   are all in the set. Mahershala Ali, you know, you've got an amazing cast of people and that's really the
[02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:17.220]   heart, the heart of it so that the technology kind of goes away. How hard is it to get the actors to act
[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:22.820]   when like the full world is not around you? We put so much of the world around them. Like when you see
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:28.020]   the city, we put like a blue screen way in the back to just make the city keep going. But we built the
[02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:32.500]   sets there, the town, we built the real set. So everything was very tangible and real.
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:39.060]   And that way she had to fit into that world and be as real as that. Because if it was all done in CG,
[02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:43.780]   well then now you can fudge everything. But if you put her in a real environment, that's a real challenge.
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:47.460]   And that really helps them on Avatar because that whole place has created an Avatar. You could get away
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:52.420]   with a lot, but they wanted to commit to that kind of detail. And on the next Avatar, that's why it just
[02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:58.340]   feels like you're really there. It's just stunning. And you get there by having something to work on
[02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:03.220]   like this to take the technology to the next level. So it was cool to be able to help, you know,
[02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:07.940]   knowing that you're being helpful to him in his process and not just distracting him. But then also
[02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:14.900]   he liked that his artists had something else to work on besides just Avatar to just work on something,
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:19.300]   you know, different to freshen up their perspective on things and methodology. And so,
[02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:21.700]   yeah, that was a really exciting movie to work on.
[02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:25.540]   And then we got to shoot it here, a Jim Cameron movie here in Austin. That was the best having
[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:31.060]   him here. And that my whole crew who's worked with me 25, 30 years, everyone had an extra spring in
[02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:35.380]   their step because they're like, wow, we're working on a Jim Cameron movie. I mean, that's just like a
[02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:38.580]   high bar of achievement for everybody, you know, working on it.
[02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:42.660]   Since we talked about a few other directors, can you speak to the genius of James Cameron? Like what,
[02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:46.500]   what makes him special? You talked about some of the difference in your approach in his,
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:53.060]   he's created some of the most special movies ever also. What's behind that? What would you
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:55.780]   say is interesting about the way his creative mind works?
[02:33:55.780 --> 02:34:01.060]   I think any of those guys, George Lucas, you know, him, you know, John Lasseter when he did Pixar,
[02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:07.540]   it's a mix of, and this was, I got really lucky. My first job was a Photoshop because my dad had a
[02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:11.540]   friend who owned a Photoshop. And he said, your summer job when I was 16, go work for my friend,
[02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:16.500]   Mario. So I go to Mario's Photoshop and I'm, you know, developing pictures or, you know,
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:22.740]   think you develop photos from film. And he said, here, take this camera home. Give me one of his cameras,
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:26.260]   take this camera home and some film. I need you to learn how to use the camera so you can help me
[02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:27.380]   sell the cameras. Yeah.
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:30.900]   So I went home and I, you know, I have a bunch of siblings. So like, well, the stars are bedhead,
[02:34:30.900 --> 02:34:35.060]   taking all these pictures of everybody. I take it back and he looks at the pictures when he develops,
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:41.700]   he's like, whoa, these are really creative. You're a creative person. So when sometimes people tell you
[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:48.420]   something that you don't, you can't unhear and he goes, that's a gift, which you need to know now,
[02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:52.740]   now you need to become technical because most creative people need technicians and technicians
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:56.980]   always need creative people because they're not usually the same. You're born with creativity.
[02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:02.660]   It's against your nature to be technical, but you can learn if you apply yourself. And if you're both
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:10.340]   technical and creative, you'll be unstoppable. And I was like, stop. Wow. So here, I want you to learn
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:15.700]   zone photography. I want you to learn this, the technical part of it. So that's why I didn't take
[02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:21.780]   a crew of Mariachi because I knew if I'm just a creative person and I need a crew to go actually
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:26.900]   technically make the movie, I'll always need something. And when you want to really change
[02:35:26.900 --> 02:35:34.340]   your life, you want to get your, I need list down to as little as possible. Because if you're like,
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:38.180]   well, I want to shoot my movie, but I need a cameraman and I need somebody who knows how to light it.
[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:43.060]   Your, your, I need list keeps growing. That's further and further and further. You will be
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:48.340]   from what you need to accomplish. So I kind of went down there without any help. So that remember
[02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:52.340]   that script analogy where the guy said, throw away three scripts. I said, no, I'm going to
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:57.060]   write three scripts and then shoot each one. So I get better at each one of those jobs. So I can learn
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:02.260]   to be technical. My technical compatibility was so little. Like I'm literally calling the guy on the
[02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:07.140]   phone. How do I use this camera? You know, that's how little I knew about it, but I knew by doing
[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:13.380]   the job I would learn by being both. That's really the key. So Jim Cameron is like that. Jim Cameron,
[02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:17.140]   when you think of those guys, George Lucas, very technical and very creative. John Lasseter,
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:23.140]   very technical, but very creative Pixar. Jim Cameron, very technical, very creative. Putting
[02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:27.940]   those two things together is really what sets you apart from other technicians and other creative
[02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:32.020]   people. And it's very, very powerful. And a lot of creative people, again, it's against their nature to
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:37.380]   be technical. They don't want to do it, make yourself do it, read the manuals, take the lessons.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:42.180]   It frees you up because then you can go do like, you know, I just showed you in that demo. You're
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:46.820]   able to now be a technical person and creative, and then you're unstoppable. He's one of the best at it.
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:53.940]   And he just knows how to craft a story. He's very analytical as well. Like we, we bounce off each
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:59.220]   other in a funny way. He goes, man, he came down to visit my studio before he did Alita. And he went,
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:05.940]   you only surround yourself with people for like you, like you exude creativity, you know,
[02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:10.340]   from every pore. And so does everyone at your studio. And I go, yeah, and everything, I didn't
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:13.700]   hire them that way on purpose, but I think if you're not that way, you kind of know, you don't belong
[02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:19.060]   there and you kind of leave. And then I went to his studio and there are a bunch of Jim Camerons there.
[02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:24.900]   They're like, oh my God, they're all very technical. You can't get all kind of fuzzy with the,
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:29.540]   with the logic or the, you can't get, you can't get really creative with a physics or anything.
[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:32.420]   They're like, no, that's not how it would work. It would be like, and they're just,
[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:40.500]   wow, super great at what they do. Bar is sky high. And they're all like that. Cause yeah,
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:44.020]   if you're not part of it, if you're not like that, you can't hang with those guys.
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:49.780]   You can't hang with him very long. I heard a story where the guitar case being a rocket launcher,
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:54.340]   where to you, you create this real world where everything is possible. The magic feels real.
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:58.340]   And for James Cameron, he has to know how a guitar case would work. That would actually be able to
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:37:59.540]   double as a rocket launcher.
[02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:02.500]   When I show him the trailer for greenhouse and he sees the machine gun leg and all that,
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:08.660]   he just goes, whoa, that's unbridled filmmaking from the id. It makes sense only the second you're
[02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:12.100]   watching it, not a second after, but the second you're watching and you believe it.
[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:18.580]   But he's a, he's really interesting in that he's so prolific. I walked into his writing studio
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:25.380]   and it'd be like on one of the tables. Like, do you have those papers there? Imagine them that thick,
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:27.860]   that thick, that thick, all scripts, scripts, scripts. What are these? He goes,
[02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:33.620]   this is a whole, you know, space opera version of this movie. We're not making that one. It's like,
[02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:38.420]   he's just cranking out all this stuff. Like again, can I take this and go make this, please?
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:42.980]   Yeah. We bounced off each other because I loved his, his analytical part of his brain. I'm not
[02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:46.180]   that analytical. I'm just kind of like, Hey, I'm really creative feeling. I'm like,
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:50.660]   like, woo, I'll go this way. And then we will go that way. And he likes that about me. But I like,
[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:55.620]   I, I, I want to be, I think about things too much. Like you think about things like
[02:38:55.620 --> 02:39:01.060]   what makes a movie a billion dollar hit? What are the elements that you need?
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:06.900]   And I'm going to analyze that. And I'm going to make sure my movie does that. And he engineers
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:12.740]   a submarine that can break the world record. He engineers a movie that can break the world record.
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:17.300]   You know, he's like, he has that engineering mind, but the creative part, that's very rare.
[02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:22.820]   So that's very rare. And he's capitalized on both. He had this submarine model, like this big on his
[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:28.660]   desk, the one that he broke the world record for going and just seeing it and knowing him have kids
[02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:34.740]   and stuff and wife. And I'm like, weren't you afraid going down there with, you know, something
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:40.980]   could happen. It's like, no, I wasn't afraid. Like, why not? Because I designed the escape vehicle.
[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:46.180]   Yeah. If it was any other Bozo, I'd be afraid, but he designed the escape, that kind of confidence.
[02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:51.700]   That's him. He just knows if some other Bozo had designed the escape vehicle, I would be afraid,
[02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:56.820]   but total confidence because he did it. The confidence of extreme competence is brilliant.
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:40:02.420]   Just to get you like excited about how creative this stuff is. So Desperado was the only movie
[02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:09.700]   on the Sony lot being edited digitally. Not only was I editing on a computer, I was editing in my house,
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:13.700]   which in 1994 was just unheard of. So I'm there in my house and they made me cut in LA
[02:40:13.700 --> 02:40:17.620]   because they were, because at first I told the studio, I want to edit Desperado myself because
[02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:22.820]   it's important that I edit it. And they go, no, you can't. Why not? We've never had a director
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:28.900]   edit his own movie here. So we don't want to set a precedent. Okay. So I thought it would give you too
[02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:36.820]   much power. This is the power of precedent. I said, well, you bought mariachi and I edited that.
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:41.220]   So I said, okay, but you're going to have to edit in LA so we can watch because we don't think you
[02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:45.140]   know what you're doing. We saw the footage and the shots are really short. It's too short.
[02:40:45.140 --> 02:40:48.340]   I was like, shots are too short. Oh, cause I was shooting my cuts.
[02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:53.140]   You know, like they're used to seeing footage of Antonio walks into the bar and it's going to be
[02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:56.580]   a dialogue scene. They expect the whole thing done from a wide shot. I would shoot the wide shot. He
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:41:00.420]   walks in, cut, move the camera. Let's get over here. Cause we went into, cause I'm not going to use it
[02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:03.540]   for the rest of the scene. I know we're going to get into coverage because I've already cut it.
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:06.820]   So I was like, huh, that's interesting. So I cut the first scene. Have you ever seen Desperado?
[02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:09.620]   The first scene is the best scene. Steve Buscemi is telling the story. He's talking about the
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:11.140]   myth of the mariachi. He's doing all this crazy.
[02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:15.700]   It's crazy. It's crazy. So then they come over. I say, you come see my first scene. So they come
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:21.780]   over to my house. They watch it. Okay. You know what you're doing. But I was cutting Desperado in
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:25.300]   my house that I rented there. And then we shot Dusk Till Dawn at the same time. So I was cutting
[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:29.620]   Desperado four rooms and Dusk Till Dawn myself. I'm the editor. I don't have an editing team other than
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:35.620]   the ones who import it into the machine. So Del Toro came over. Soderbergh came over. Can I borrow it
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:40.180]   for Schizophilus? No one had heard of somebody having an Avid in their living room.
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:44.500]   Jim comes over and he goes, I hear you have an Avid in your living room.
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:48.580]   And then I go, yeah, come check it out. I'm just like, I roll out of bed. It's like
[02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:54.260]   sounds unremarkable because that's what you do right now. But back in 94, it was unheard of.
[02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:59.220]   I'm cutting three movies at the same time myself. I roll out of bed. I come here. I can cut
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:03.460]   Desperado. I can cut Dusk Till Dawn. He went, that's it. I hate working with editors. You know,
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:08.660]   when I was doing Terminator 2, they wouldn't even let me put the bad to the bone song in Terminator 2,
[02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:12.100]   because they didn't think it would work. And I had to sneak into the edit room at night
[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:15.860]   on the weekend to cut it in and then show them the next day. It's like, that's your own movie.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:20.420]   You can't give that kind of power to people. He said, I hate working with editors. I'm going to
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:23.700]   do this. I'm going to tear down a wall in my house. I'm going to put it in Avid. I'm going to cut my
[02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:27.540]   next movie. And he did. He got an Oscar for editing Titanic. He had two other editors,
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:32.500]   but now no one ever took him for a ride like that again. He edits on every movie. He has other editors,
[02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:37.300]   but he can go do his own cuts. When he shows me like footage, he's showing me himself on his own
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:44.260]   machine. And it's like, again, it gives you all those tools to be able to really find your vision
[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:47.460]   that you're looking for, because you can't always explain it to somebody because you don't always
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:50.660]   know yourself. It's part of, you kind of come up with it as you do the process.
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:54.420]   Just a small tangent about the different software and the technologies involved. So you mentioned
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:56.340]   Avid as Premiere Pro.
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:00.180]   Premiere was still in its early stages then. I think Soderbergh looked at it and he said,
[02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:04.180]   yeah, I can't afford an Avid for this movie. I'm going to go do it. I think he started cutting on
[02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:08.900]   Premiere, but I'm sure it's all better now. I just have always used an Avid because I just always
[02:43:08.900 --> 02:43:13.140]   ran it back to the same production. I think I've just, I don't have to buy a new one, but there's
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:15.940]   lots of good, I've heard about all kinds of systems. I just use the same one.
[02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:19.860]   I guess that's the question I have for you. It's just interesting for people. It's very
[02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:24.980]   interesting to me, just the details. Use Avid. What do you like? Multiple monitors, one monitor.
[02:43:24.980 --> 02:43:29.380]   I have a couple of monitors and then one big monitor to watch it if I'm watching the scene
[02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:33.060]   back because the monitors are still a little wacky. I mean, if I were to design my own system,
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:38.340]   I'd probably design it differently, but I'm literally, I've worked on that thing since 94.
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:42.100]   I still don't know all the shortcuts and all that shit. I still use it like my tape deck,
[02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:47.540]   play, rewind, pause, and I can cut so fast with that. I don't use the mouse for shortcuts. I'm just like,
[02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:53.460]   like, so you found your way, preferred way, the workflow of using it. And now you can
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:56.820]   sort of let go of the technical and then be creative.
[02:43:56.820 --> 02:43:59.620]   Yeah. Just be creative. It's just a tool. It's just a tool. And it's like,
[02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:03.460]   it doesn't matter which system it is. It's like, if you can get it to work for you, great. Like,
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:07.380]   there's a lot of problems I have with it that I would, I know are probably fixed on another system,
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:11.300]   but that they'll have a whole other set of problems. So it's like, well, why bother with that?
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:15.620]   You know, there's limitations. I think that it has that would need to be fixed, but not for what I'm doing.
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:17.220]   I mean, I can still do what I need.
[02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:23.060]   It feels like part of the artistry is every system has limitations and you learn how to work around those limitations.
[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:31.300]   I mean, my first VCRs, like those things, those things were, I was always known for taking what
[02:44:31.300 --> 02:44:36.180]   little basic equipment and milking the shit out of it, what it could, pushing the boundaries of what
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:41.540]   it can do. And now it's flipped. Now you're working on a program and you can spend 10 years on this thing
[02:44:41.540 --> 02:44:46.580]   and you're scratching the surface of what it's capable of. It's totally flipped the other way. I'm not milking
[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:53.060]   anything anymore. I'm, I'm barely getting, you know, the smallest capability of it. Cause I would
[02:44:53.060 --> 02:44:57.060]   have to spend a lot of time to figure out all the stuff that it can possibly do. And I'm sure it's,
[02:44:57.060 --> 02:45:01.380]   it's all great, fantastic stuff, but what a different world than when I grew up where it was like, okay,
[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:07.140]   let me splice these two sound things together. And it was so hard to get it to do, but people would be
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:12.020]   like, you got that movie out of that equipment where now it's the other way around. You know, it's like,
[02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:15.300]   all this equipment is great. So when people come to me and say, I've got, well,
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:19.140]   I've only got this camera. I was like, the camera's 10 times better than anything I had
[02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:24.340]   for my first 15 years of filmmaking. So you have no complaints. This is like,
[02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:26.340]   you can just start now and just start making stuff.
[02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:31.300]   Uh, I have a lot of friends who are huge fans of your, uh, movies. So one of them asked me that
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:34.580]   I'm absolutely must ask you, do you know if there's a sequel of Alita coming?
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:38.660]   Oh, we're working on it. We're definitely working on it. Jim and I both want to make it,
[02:45:38.660 --> 02:45:43.860]   but it's usually when we meet, we talk about it. Um, I gave him something to read,
[02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:47.700]   you know, he's a little busy with his avatar movie, but I'm going to get,
[02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:51.140]   I'm going to see him again soon and we'll see where it's at, but we would love to make another
[02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:53.940]   one. We have ideas on how to do it. Cause it was always built to be a trilogy.
[02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:59.220]   And, uh, he sees that there's a lot of love for it. It was just weird. Cause it was Fox movie
[02:45:59.780 --> 02:46:04.420]   and they got bought by Disney, you know, and then, so they weren't really making Fox movies
[02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:08.420]   because they had enough, had enough work with their Disney movies, but now they started to make some
[02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:12.980]   Fox movies. Like they did Deadpool and some Fox movies are starting to get made. So
[02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:17.060]   time might be right for us to come back and do an Alita.
[02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:23.300]   No, I hope you do soon. It's a, but it is, I mean, you do so many different kinds of movies.
[02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:25.220]   That's a whole different kind of puzzle, right?
[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:29.300]   Yeah. No, but it's not a bad one. It's a good one. It's a cool. It's one of the few,
[02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:34.660]   like usually I made kids, family kids, kids movies or R rated action horror movies. And that was the
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:38.820]   first time I got to do a PG 13 movie, which was kind of like, it had a lot of action, but it was for
[02:46:38.820 --> 02:46:41.460]   families could watch it too. And it's kind of like the best of all worlds.
[02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:47.940]   Have to ask you about Sin City. One of my favorite films of all time. It was a visually stunning world.
[02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:54.740]   What are some maybe interesting detailed aspects about you creating that world?
[02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:57.380]   This is why you just got to follow your nose and go do something, you know,
[02:46:57.380 --> 02:47:02.020]   Jim and I were both into 3d early on. Like I visited his set for the Terminator 3d ride.
[02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:05.380]   Just till dawn, I wanted to be 3d. Actually, when they got to the bar,
[02:47:05.380 --> 02:47:09.140]   if you watched from that point on and everything's kind of set up for three,
[02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:13.220]   everything was shooting into the camera and all this, but the cameras they had for 3d and film
[02:47:13.220 --> 02:47:18.100]   was those old shitty ones that were so bad that I went, okay, we can't do it. But I really wanted
[02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:22.820]   people to have to put on glasses when they got into the bar and it was going to turn into a 3d different
[02:47:22.820 --> 02:47:29.460]   movie. I got to do that on spike. It's 3d. So when I did spike, it's 3d. I thought, oh, if I get
[02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:36.340]   Jim's cameras that he's done for these underwater 3d, you know, documentaries, I can make the first digital
[02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:43.540]   3d film for theaters. And so I did. And it seemed like the easiest way was to utilize that when you
[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:47.860]   put on the glasses, when you go into a game world. So there's a green screen and we shot all the actors
[02:47:47.860 --> 02:47:52.420]   on green screen for all the game stuff. And we can do a lot of 3d stuff coming at kids faces when they're
[02:47:52.420 --> 02:47:57.700]   reaching my 3d is, is not like the kind they have in theaters where it's very polite. Mine's like
[02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:02.660]   theme park 3d where kids are doing like that, trying to grab. That's why it was such a big hit.
[02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:07.540]   Nobody does 3d like that, but I wanted that. I want shit falling in people's laps, you know?
[02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:12.180]   So you remember, so you would go, okay, this is why I'm wearing the glasses and I'm wondering why.
[02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:15.300]   And when I went to go make my next movie, so this is how crazy is what we shot.
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:20.820]   Spike is three. Remember actually how fast they came out. That was in the summer of 2003.
[02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:26.500]   few months later, once upon a time, Mexico came out to number one movies. Both were finishing
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:34.100]   trilogies of mine. And each one starred Antonio, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin. When I was editing those
[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:37.380]   at the same time, you'd be like, whoa, they're killing people. The other ones are like with the
[02:48:37.380 --> 02:48:42.420]   kids going like, Hey family. So it was really, you know, fun. It was fun to, it's easier to do
[02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:45.700]   very different things than to do like two action movies or two family movies at the same time.
[02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:50.340]   But I was like, okay, what's my next movie going to be? Oh shit. How crazy is this? Okay.
[02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:53.620]   So Antonio is on the set. I'm going to shoot him out in half a day
[02:48:53.620 --> 02:49:00.420]   for Spike is 3d. Cause he's only in the last scenes on the green screen, shoot him to lunch.
[02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:03.940]   Okay. Now go away, put on your desperado outfit. Cause we owed some shots for once upon a time,
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:08.180]   Mexico on the green screen. He finished two trilogies in the same day. That's gotta be a
[02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:13.540]   first. If ever, no one's ever finished two trilogies in the same day. And it's just kismet,
[02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:19.060]   you know, it's just how it happened to happen that day was just luck or the universe or whatever,
[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:25.140]   but I needed to get something new now. So I was looking through my bookshelves of inspiration
[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:29.460]   and I picked up my sin city books, which I've had. I used to be a cartoonist and I always loved how he
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:33.700]   drew that. Every time I'd see a different edition, I'd buy it, go home and go, Oh, I already have this.
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:38.340]   I got like three copies of this already. And it would just always grab me by the throat. And I liked that
[02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:42.900]   he was a writer director in a way, cause he would not just wrote the comic, but he drew it too.
[02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:45.860]   A lot of times it's a different writer or different comic artists. He's like a real,
[02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:51.380]   like a kinship, you know, this is someone who writes and directs his own thing. But I was looking at it
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:55.060]   and I went, Oh shit, I know how to do this now. I just did it on the green screen. If I shoot this
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:59.620]   on green screen, the actors on green screen, I can make the backgrounds look just like this. And I can
[02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:05.300]   contrast up the actors and I could get this very graphic look, which sometimes for a window, it's just a
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:11.460]   white box. So it's even got a sliding scale for budget. If I run out of money, just put the actors
[02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:15.380]   in black and white, just put like a white dot behind him for a streetlight. And that looks just like the
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:21.780]   book. So I'm going to bring the book to life. So I'll show you how fast we go from development
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:27.700]   at troublemaker. It was October. Once upon a time, Mexico would come out.
[02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:33.540]   I was like, Oh shit, I know how to do this now since city. I'm going to do a test. I went to my green
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:36.740]   screen here in my studio. You'll see my green screen where I shot all these movies
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:41.620]   and I shot, you know, uh, my sister, myself, put it black and white.
[02:50:41.620 --> 02:50:48.340]   Looks just like the comic, but it's moving. So I, I call a, uh, comic book artist friend of mine,
[02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:52.740]   Mike Allred. And I said, uh, do you have Frank Miller's number? And he goes, yeah, I do. Okay.
[02:50:52.740 --> 02:50:57.300]   I'm going to call him up. So I called Frank Miller. Hey, it's Robert Rodriguez. I have a test. I'm
[02:50:57.300 --> 02:51:01.300]   going to show you for Sin City. I'm going to be in New York tomorrow. He's like tomorrow. Okay. Yeah,
[02:51:01.300 --> 02:51:06.900]   sure. Come by. Meet me at this bar. Okay. Book a flight for New York. I fly up there. I have my
[02:51:06.900 --> 02:51:14.180]   laptop just like this. I go to the bar, I show him what looks like an image from his comic and it starts
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:20.100]   moving. And he's like, wow, how did you do that? I said, I got my own studio and all this. And then
[02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:25.300]   I started telling him, man, let's make this movie. Cause no one had the rights to it. He never gave
[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:28.740]   the rights to a studio. A lot of comics. Oh, one of your brothers bought this a while back,
[02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:33.140]   you know, or then you got to go through the studio. He still owned his own rights. In fact,
[02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:37.220]   he'd gotten burned by Hollywood so many times as a screenwriter that he said, fuck it. I'm going to
[02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:42.020]   go back and draw a comic. That's so raw that can never be made into a movie. So of course I call
[02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:47.780]   him, Hey, let's make a great movie. I show him how we can do it. And I go, I know you don't know me
[02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:51.540]   and you're not going to, you're going to have to earn, I have to earn your trust for you to give me
[02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:58.420]   your baby. Uh, but we can make this right away. And he's like, uh, he's all excited for about two
[02:51:58.420 --> 02:52:03.620]   seconds. And then he goes, Oh no, then we got to write a script. And then the studio is going to have
[02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:07.620]   notes. All that shit he's been through before. And it's not like that. I have a whole different
[02:52:07.620 --> 02:52:12.660]   setup. I got my own studio in Austin. This is how it's going to be. If you like this idea, I'm going to,
[02:52:12.660 --> 02:52:14.900]   you're not going to have to take any risk. Let me take all the risk.
[02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:20.180]   I'm going to go write the script myself next month. It's going to be unremarkable because
[02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:22.500]   I'm going to write it right out of your book. I'm going to just go to, I'm going to edit three
[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:25.700]   of the stories down. I'm going to just take stuff out. Really. It might add a few things to connect
[02:52:25.700 --> 02:52:30.900]   it, but I'll write the script in December myself. No money involved. Then we'll call some actor
[02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:34.100]   friends of mine. We'll have them come to my green screen. We'll shoot the opening scene
[02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:40.900]   as a test, but it's also the opening scene. I'll do the effects myself. I'll do the sound,
[02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:46.340]   do the music. I'll do fake credits. We'll watch it together. If you like what you see,
[02:52:46.500 --> 02:52:50.980]   we'll make the movie. You give me the rights. Then if you don't like it, keep it. It's a short
[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:56.820]   film to show your friends. Let's be really cool. He's like, all right. There's nothing on him to do.
[02:52:56.820 --> 02:53:02.260]   It's all in me. I write the script in December, January, Josh Arnett, Marlee Shelton, come down,
[02:53:02.260 --> 02:53:06.980]   fly Frank in shooting for 10 hours on my green screen. We shoot that opening sequence.
[02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:11.780]   Incredible opening sequence. Record his voiceover right then in my little voiceover booth.
[02:53:11.780 --> 02:53:17.540]   Marlee Shelton comes up. Why did I hire him to kill me? I don't know. Let's go ask Frank. He's right
[02:53:17.540 --> 02:53:22.740]   here. Let's go ask Frank. I want to know myself. He tells her and he's like, I want to do this movie.
[02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:27.700]   He's already, as I tell you, Frank, I used to be cartoonist. It's the same thing. You're already
[02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:32.740]   a director. You're just using a pen instead of a camera. The performances you get out of your paper
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:38.180]   actors are phenomenal. The shots you do are like beyond any DP has ever done. And the visual look,
[02:53:38.180 --> 02:53:42.580]   we've never seen that. I want to just take this and make it move. I just want the comic to move.
[02:53:42.580 --> 02:53:47.060]   Any other studio would just go make it look like any gritty crime movie and they would,
[02:53:47.060 --> 02:53:51.300]   they would miss the point that it's the visual is half of it. I want it to look just like this
[02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:54.740]   because it would be the boldest movie anyone's seen. Cause that's how it reads. When I read the
[02:53:54.740 --> 02:53:57.300]   book, it's like, if this was moving, it would be the most phenomenal movie.
[02:53:57.300 --> 02:54:03.460]   In fact, I asked him, do you ever feel like directing any, any of these short ones? I thought
[02:54:03.460 --> 02:54:06.900]   about directing the big fat kill, maybe as a short films. You should come direct that one.
[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:09.780]   Shit. You should direct all of them with me. Cause I'm really copying it right out of a book. You
[02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:15.140]   should direct it with me. All right, let's go. So then, uh, January. Okay. So remember I met him
[02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:19.620]   in November. I wrote it in December, January. We shoot the test. Took me a couple of weeks to do
[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:25.380]   the effects. He loves it. I make a meeting with Bruce Willis, show it to Bruce Willis. What's so cool
[02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:30.580]   about doing that opening scene is that any actor I show it to now, I show him the book, which is awesome.
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:35.300]   You'd be playing this character, but look at this test. Let me show you the book. What it looked like
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:42.820]   before I turned this test into a test watches it. Josh Arnett voiceover music titles. Come on.
[02:54:42.820 --> 02:54:48.260]   First name on the screen, Bruce Willis. And I go, Hey, look, you're in the credits. You have to do it
[02:54:48.260 --> 02:54:55.220]   now. Manifesting it. Right. He's like, shit, man, this is great. I'm in. He's in, go get everyone
[02:54:55.220 --> 02:55:00.740]   else from that. It was just easy to get. And we were filming the movie. So February,
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:07.140]   right. Building the few little sets we had, like the bar. I told Frank, we don't need to build a bar,
[02:55:07.140 --> 02:55:09.460]   but I'm going to go ahead and build a bar. So we have a place to go have script meetings.
[02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:13.380]   Everything else will be green screen. We'll build fake steps and things out of green.
[02:55:13.380 --> 02:55:17.060]   So we're doing that. And I'm casting the first one. We're shooting the movie by March,
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:25.140]   beginning of March. And I remember because my son was born March 3rd. And I was in LA for his birth
[02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:31.140]   because I was also recording the orchestra for the score I wrote somehow in the past few months for
[02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:39.220]   Kill Bill 2. That's how much stuff was going on. That's like when you just let it flow,
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:46.660]   you're just riding the wave. You're not doing any of that. So that's what's by staying in that
[02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:52.020]   like urgent, there's always the deadlines are just pushing you to create stuff. And we shot the movie
[02:55:52.020 --> 02:55:56.580]   so fast in record time. Now, not only that, I shot a whole other movie that year. I shot
[02:55:56.580 --> 02:56:01.500]   The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl with kids that came out two months after Sin City the next year,
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:05.060]   within less than a year, Sin City was out. You're shooting that in parallel with Sin City. That's
[02:56:05.060 --> 02:56:08.340]   hilarious. Is that great? Yeah. Like sometimes we'd be shooting with the kids and then the afternoon
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:11.780]   Rudger Howard would come and some of the Sin City girls to finish, you know, shooting stuff that we
[02:56:11.780 --> 02:56:17.540]   needed to film. It was just insane how fast we had to move. I was doing it in my head. I was editing.
[02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:26.180]   I just edited it. And then I would scan the artwork into the computer and I would edit the storyboards
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:30.580]   with the sound effects and I would do the voiceover. I would imitate Mickey and I would imitate Bruce
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:35.780]   and lay out how fast it was going to move. And you were like, wow. So now we have a template
[02:56:35.780 --> 02:56:39.380]   with the real drawings and the lighting on how we're going to do it. It was funny because I
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:43.380]   could do pretty good in Bruce Willis because I know in his career so long, if you're doing his voiceover
[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:49.220]   and he would hear my guide voice for the timing, he'd be like, is that me or is that you? Can't tell.
[02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:54.420]   It's like, oh, that one was me, but just do that. It's like, oh man, it sounds like me.
[02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:58.260]   First of all, why haven't films like that been made?
[02:56:58.260 --> 02:57:02.980]   Well, it's a very specific look because it went into that comic. The first piece of music I wrote for that
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:06.580]   was the main title and I called it descent. I wanted the notes to descend because it felt
[02:57:06.580 --> 02:57:10.020]   like you were descending into this dark world and you don't come out to the end of the movie.
[02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:15.700]   You're just like in this world where all these layers of unreality, like water doesn't photograph
[02:57:15.700 --> 02:57:19.140]   that way, snow doesn't photograph, but it's there and you're seeing and you're seeing the actors.
[02:57:19.140 --> 02:57:21.140]   So you're just really, it's like a dream world.
[02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:21.700]   Yeah.
[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:26.260]   So I was really into it and I did tests for the most difficult shots first. Like,
[02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:31.860]   how do I get his tape to glow in the dark, like in the comics, so it's still in the shadow. And I
[02:57:31.860 --> 02:57:37.140]   realized, oh, use fluorescent tape and a fluorescent light. That way I can keep it. We can still key it.
[02:57:37.140 --> 02:57:42.980]   Like I started just doing my own visual effects like that early on because I knew technology was
[02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:48.260]   changing so fast that I would need to just know how to do it. Like I'm like a magician shooting
[02:57:48.260 --> 02:57:52.820]   digital. Nobody wanted to touch digital back then. DPs were all afraid of digital. They didn't want to
[02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:58.580]   have to learn something new. So I had to DP it. So be photographing it. I'm like, it's so fun to cut
[02:57:58.580 --> 02:58:03.620]   because I mean, to, to light, like you have to have that light out of frame right now, but I could bring
[02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:08.100]   the lights in right here. As long as it was, they're not crossing it. I'm just going to take
[02:58:08.100 --> 02:58:12.420]   it out of the green anyway. So I could have the coolest light on everybody, cool edge lights. You
[02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:16.660]   can have an edge light back here, an edge light back here, a fill light here, but you don't erase
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:21.700]   them. I just take him out. Can you educate me and people curious about this? Oh, like what is the power
[02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:27.380]   of light when you're telling a story, when you're creating a feeling and experience, like what's the
[02:58:27.380 --> 02:58:33.300]   artistry of that? Well, if you look at the drawings too, sometimes it's the absence of light. Like you would see
[02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:37.140]   this face, but then this would be completely black, but you would still see my eye, which is
[02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:42.100]   like impossible. Right. But you believe it when you see it. Cause it's there. So things like that were
[02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:46.180]   a lot of the tricks I tried first. Cause I liked that about it. It's like, you have a guy completely
[02:58:46.180 --> 02:58:51.380]   backlit. So there's no light on his face, but yet his glasses are glowing white. So we'd put fluorescent
[02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:55.460]   tape in there, hit that with a light. Then we could turn it white later. The black and white really helps.
[02:58:55.460 --> 02:59:00.500]   And then just upping the contrast. But I mean, it's just something that you have a feeling for,
[02:59:00.500 --> 02:59:02.980]   but you're able to try it. In fact, when I took it to George
[02:59:02.980 --> 02:59:08.100]   Lucas who George Lucas said this to me early on, cause I was, we're the only guy shooting digital.
[02:59:08.100 --> 02:59:12.980]   He said, man, it's so good. You live in Austin. That's why I'm in Marin County.
[02:59:12.980 --> 02:59:18.900]   Cause when you live outside of this box of LA, Hollywood, you think outside of the box automatically,
[02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:22.580]   you're just going to stumble upon innovations. And he was right. It was like, well, yeah,
[02:59:22.580 --> 02:59:25.540]   what's this? Why, why aren't we shooting digital? Let's shoot digital. Why are we shooting digital 3d?
[02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:28.900]   Let's do that. Why don't we just use green screen for the background? You just start innovating
[02:59:28.900 --> 02:59:33.460]   because you're away from anyone saying, Hey, you can't do it that way, which they would say if I was
[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:38.020]   in LA. So we just came up with a whole other method. So I took him since city to check out
[02:59:38.020 --> 02:59:43.700]   the first thing I was going to show at Comic-Con. He said, um, now this will really show people
[02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:48.500]   what digital is capable of. This really shows how avant-garde you can get with that.
[02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:55.220]   that you can never have done that on film, you know? And so by me versing myself in that technology
[02:59:55.220 --> 02:59:59.460]   early, I was able to make a movie like that. And then everyone had to play catch up, you know? So
[02:59:59.460 --> 03:00:04.260]   you should always just follow your, that's why people say, don't use those curtains as I'm going
[03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:11.220]   to work. Just blow past those guys, go innovate your own thing. Cause sometimes not knowing is better,
[03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:16.020]   you know, being too naive to like, don't you know, you shouldn't have been able to make that movie that
[03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:20.660]   way. People would, people would say like, how did you make my marriage for $7,000? Just,
[03:00:20.660 --> 03:00:25.380]   you know, it's impossible. It's like, why do you keep using that word? Cause it can't be impossible
[03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:29.860]   if I did it. Cause I'm not that smart. And it's like saying, how did you get to the top of Mount
[03:00:29.860 --> 03:00:35.460]   Everest? It's impossible. Well, I just kept walking. I didn't realize it was kind of at a slope. I didn't
[03:00:35.460 --> 03:00:39.620]   really realize it was going up that high. Yeah. You you've talked about like a big part of your
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:45.860]   approach to filmmaking to life is manifesting, manifesting the reality you want. In fact, I should
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:52.020]   sort of comment and I'd love to ask you about manifesting. You asked me at the beginning of
[03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:56.580]   this conversation, do you consider yourself a creative person? I should sort of reflect on
[03:00:56.580 --> 03:01:00.660]   that because I was very uncomfortable answering that. Yeah. I noticed a little bit and I was like,
[03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:03.460]   I'm going to, I'm going to free you up so that you're never uncomfortable again.
[03:01:03.460 --> 03:01:06.260]   It's scary just to say that about, about yourself.
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:09.300]   Cause you think there's a lot of, there's a lot of people who go, well, you're not an artist,
[03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:12.260]   you're not a creative, but you're not saying I'm an artist. I'm saying I'm a creative
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:15.700]   person, but that's an artist too, isn't it? No, artist isn't necessarily a guy
[03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:19.780]   with a French mustache and the funny ad. That's not necessarily what an artist, artists are regular
[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:24.260]   people. Yeah. And regular people relate to art that's imperfect. If you can make art that's
[03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:28.100]   perfect, don't want to relate to it. So when you think about it like that, you go, well,
[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:33.620]   I can make imperfect art. So yeah, I'm an artist. And if you have doubt, you're an artist. That's an
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:38.020]   artist. Real artists always wonder if they're good enough. So you are an artist. Just by the fact that
[03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:42.900]   you had uncomfortable saying it, you're a real artist. Yeah. And there's some degree,
[03:01:42.900 --> 03:01:47.220]   I don't know if you could speak to this, but, um, you know, there's a fear of creating
[03:01:47.220 --> 03:01:53.620]   shitty things. You know, I've, I've created a lot of really shitty things in my life and it always
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:59.540]   feels like that's really important to do. Okay. But you're judging something that, that you have no
[03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:05.540]   business judging, right? Like I have so many people. That's why I like making movies on purpose that have
[03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:11.380]   less money and less time on purpose. Like the biggest movie I said at all time on Netflix is
[03:02:11.380 --> 03:02:15.220]   we can be heroes. I told them, I don't want to spend more than $50 million. I know you all want to give
[03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:19.620]   me 80, but I want to be a hero and come into 50 because one, it'll make it better. And then two,
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:23.380]   you'll, you'll make three of them instead of just one. I don't want to just go spend the farm. And
[03:02:23.380 --> 03:02:27.220]   how many filmmakers will do that? Don't try to get as much money as they can, but when you're spending
[03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:33.060]   less, it's a win-win situation and you have more creative freedom. It's going to leave you alone. You can do whatever you want.
[03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:37.780]   So I, I like the creative limitations that come from less money. That's why I like brass knuckle films.
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:42.740]   Like we're going to make them for less so that they are better, not because they're not to make them
[03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:48.340]   shitty. So many people have come up to me and said, um, you know what part I love in your movie? They'll
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:53.540]   tell me some scene. And I'm like, oh, well that's because we ran out of sun and we had to like do that
[03:02:53.540 --> 03:02:58.820]   jump with just him jumping on a pad three times or whatever it is. It's something that you fumbled
[03:02:58.820 --> 03:03:04.820]   together. And that's what they're drawn to. They're drawn to that imperfect thing. And so I wouldn't judge it
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:10.420]   because somebody's, you know, if you called your movie shitty, that's like John Carpenter saying, yeah, nobody liked the
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:16.660]   thing and it's a shitty movie and everyone hated it. So it must not be good. And then 10 years later, it's a masterpiece.
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:24.020]   Don't judge it. Cause if you, words we use on ourselves are very powerful. So if you say,
[03:03:24.020 --> 03:03:29.220]   well, you know, I'm kind of an artist sometimes I make a lot of shitty stuff. Well, that's going to,
[03:03:29.220 --> 03:03:34.420]   that's going to be your lot in life. You know, I I'm pretty good shape for a director. It's not
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:39.700]   because I'm operating the camera because I work out. Right. But I always hated working out. I was not
[03:03:39.700 --> 03:03:46.660]   into sports. I was a filmmaker. I was a cartoonist in high school. I was really tall. They would say,
[03:03:46.660 --> 03:03:50.260]   come work, come be in our team. We need, it's a small school. We need you. And I'm like,
[03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:54.100]   I don't know how to play any of these things. I'm an artist. There's a line in the faculty. That's
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:57.540]   was my line to my coaches. When they would say, you got to come run with everybody. I would say,
[03:03:57.540 --> 03:04:02.580]   I don't think a person should run unless he's being chased. I get that to the Elijah Wood character,
[03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:05.940]   because that's the guy I identified with. He's there with this camera and that was me.
[03:04:05.940 --> 03:04:11.300]   So I hated it. And then because I had, I was a cartoonist, you know, drawing like this for hours,
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:15.780]   four hours, my back would go out like out for a month. It would just go out from being so
[03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:18.980]   so tall and crunched over. And then when I started making movies, operating the camera,
[03:04:18.980 --> 03:04:23.700]   doing steady cam, every year would go out to where I would need cortisone shots to get
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:30.980]   up again if I'm filming or just be out for a month. And on Spy Kids 2, Ricardo Montalban had bad back
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:36.820]   surgery that went wrong and he was in a wheelchair. So he's in a wheelchair and I'm in a walker. And he's
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:43.700]   like, I'm 84. What's your excuse? And I was like, I don't know. I just was operating steady. He goes,
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:47.700]   you have to work out, Robert. You have to work out. And I was like, yeah, okay. Yeah, I know. I know.
[03:04:47.700 --> 03:04:52.100]   And so then I thought, okay, next year I'm working with Stallone. I'll ask Stallone, that's Stallone.
[03:04:52.100 --> 03:04:56.740]   How do you get in shape? Because I need to get in shape. My back's always going out. He goes,
[03:04:56.740 --> 03:05:02.180]   get the trainer. Anyone who ever saw in Hollywood got in shape, they had a trainer. I say, even you,
[03:05:02.180 --> 03:05:06.100]   anybody, oh, I need a trainer. He has a trainer. I said, oh, no, I need a trainer. I can't train.
[03:05:06.100 --> 03:05:11.380]   It's like, well, shit, if you can't even train on your own, then what do us mortal men have? So I got
[03:05:11.380 --> 03:05:16.500]   a trainer and guess what happened? Hated it. I would feel sick when he's coming over because I hate working
[03:05:16.500 --> 03:05:23.060]   it. And then some years of doing that, I just, I can't stand it. But I know it's good for my health.
[03:05:23.060 --> 03:05:27.540]   So the desire's there. So if you can't accomplish something in your life, it's not a lack of desire.
[03:05:27.540 --> 03:05:32.260]   Like if you want to be more creative, it's not a lack of desire. It's a lack of identity. Like
[03:05:32.260 --> 03:05:36.500]   you're like the fact that you went, you were comfortable about saying creative. It's because
[03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:41.940]   there's a lack of identity there. You have lots of desire. You got to get the identity up and then
[03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:46.660]   suddenly you're, you're making, you're making shit. So I, a friend of mine from Mexico, she comes over,
[03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:50.340]   I have to stop smoking. My doctor said I have to stop smoking for my health. So I have to,
[03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:54.100]   so I'm not smoking right now. So I've been smoking since I was eight years old.
[03:05:54.100 --> 03:05:58.740]   He said, well, you're going to go back to smoking. Cause you just told me your identity is a smoker.
[03:05:58.740 --> 03:06:05.060]   So right now you're a smoker. Who's not smoking. What's going to happen? Eventually you have to say,
[03:06:05.060 --> 03:06:09.540]   I'm a non-smoker. You know, like just that, that lesson I had forgotten. You have to say,
[03:06:09.540 --> 03:06:13.460]   I'm a non-smoker. I'm a non-smoker. It's what does a non-smoker do? If you believe you're a non-smoker,
[03:06:13.460 --> 03:06:18.420]   you hate smoke, start choking at the smell of smoke. Okay. I'll try that. She walks off.
[03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:22.500]   I go, shit. I forgot about my own. I wonder where in my life I could apply that.
[03:06:22.500 --> 03:06:28.900]   Working out. Of course, my God, I hate working out. No wonder I am so miserable. I'll tell my
[03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:33.940]   trainer and anyone who will listen, I can't stand working out. I don't understand sports. So that day
[03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:41.060]   I said, I'm an athlete. I'm an athlete. That's the last thing I would ever call myself all through
[03:06:41.060 --> 03:06:48.180]   my entire life. This was 2012. I'm an athlete. By the next day, not only did my life completely change
[03:06:48.180 --> 03:06:54.900]   and it's easier if it's opposite day. Like if you're just doing it by degrees, that's bullshit.
[03:06:54.900 --> 03:06:59.460]   You got to go complete opposite. Cause if there's like a donut, you know, if you say, well, I'm going to
[03:06:59.460 --> 03:07:06.020]   only half of it, you got to go, no, I'm going to get an apple. Opposite is much easier. Not only did
[03:07:06.020 --> 03:07:10.340]   I change my life working out, I didn't ever needed a trainer. I have not had a trainer since all those
[03:07:10.340 --> 03:07:15.860]   years. Cause I'm an athlete. I'll just do it. What does an athlete do? An athlete loves working out.
[03:07:15.860 --> 03:07:22.180]   An athlete will make time to work out and they'll eat right. I was, I would never be the person that
[03:07:22.180 --> 03:07:26.820]   would call themselves an athlete, but that's how much it can change your life by changing your identity.
[03:07:26.820 --> 03:07:32.100]   So if you want to be more creative, you've, you've already got that in your, that desire.
[03:07:32.100 --> 03:07:36.340]   You've got enough of that. You don't need more desire. You need more identity. So you got to say,
[03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:42.100]   I'm a creative person with a straight face. So when I say, Hey, are you going to be a,
[03:07:42.100 --> 03:07:46.180]   are you a creative person? You go, yeah. Cause then if you say that, what do you do? You're going to do
[03:07:46.180 --> 03:07:49.780]   more creative stuff. Cause that's what a creative person does. It doesn't make sense to me how
[03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:55.540]   manifesting works, but it does seem to work like basically visualizing, visualizing a path towards
[03:07:55.540 --> 03:08:01.300]   a certain kind of future. I guess everything around you, everything within you kind of makes way for
[03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:06.500]   that makes way for the possibility of that. It's weird. It's weird, but it kind of, it's a kind of a
[03:08:06.500 --> 03:08:10.020]   nice to know that you can do that, but you have to just have that conviction and just say,
[03:08:11.300 --> 03:08:17.300]   start with a label. Yeah. The double R or the label you just gave yourself. Like I changed my
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:22.580]   label. My label was, I hate working out. I'm an athlete. I'm an athlete. I'm not a non-athlete
[03:08:22.580 --> 03:08:26.980]   anymore. I'm changing my label and you get so inspired because now you know what to do because
[03:08:26.980 --> 03:08:30.980]   you can't help but conform to your identity. You're always going to conform to your identity. So just
[03:08:30.980 --> 03:08:35.620]   change your identity and you'll change your life. But, and it's not that hard. I didn't have to go get
[03:08:35.620 --> 03:08:40.580]   hypnotized or anything. It was literally, I just told myself, if I could do that, go from a guy who doesn't
[03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:45.940]   want to work out. Hates it. Hates it. I had the desire. I was already hiring the guy.
[03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:49.220]   I lacked the identity. As soon as I changed my identity, boom.
[03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:53.060]   Well, one of the things for me like that is probably music, just playing guitar.
[03:08:53.060 --> 03:08:56.500]   Are you a musician? Yeah, I'm a musician.
[03:08:56.500 --> 03:09:01.460]   I would definitely not. I mean, I'm, I'm going along with it now, but if we're honestly,
[03:09:01.460 --> 03:09:03.300]   if we're just- You wouldn't have said that. I wouldn't have said that.
[03:09:03.300 --> 03:09:05.540]   But I heard you rip on fucking guitar.
[03:09:05.540 --> 03:09:08.980]   And I've heard you play kind of amazing in all different kinds of contexts.
[03:09:08.980 --> 03:09:10.380]   Oh, but I, I should be like,
[03:09:10.380 --> 03:09:13.580]   freaking Santana by now because I've had a guitar in my hand since I was a kid. But
[03:09:13.580 --> 03:09:15.740]   since I'm not a full-time musician,
[03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:22.700]   I don't get to play it that often. So I'm not as good as I should be. But, you know,
[03:09:22.700 --> 03:09:26.380]   when you apply yourself to just rehearse for, you know, a couple of shows, you book some shows.
[03:09:26.940 --> 03:09:32.300]   Look at this. This is me just like playing our first arena show opening for George Lopez.
[03:09:32.300 --> 03:09:37.580]   That was crazy to be on the stages where you're heroes that you saw them. Now you're seeing what
[03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:41.580]   their point of view was. It blows your mind. You need to just get on stage. You get on stage once and
[03:09:41.580 --> 03:09:43.740]   you'll see that it's not as bad as you think.
[03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:47.580]   You're not, you're not like terrified because you're playing pretty complicated things. I've
[03:09:47.580 --> 03:09:48.460]   seen you play live.
[03:09:48.460 --> 03:09:52.220]   Yeah. And I messed up a bunch of times, but you don't want to focus on that. And you just go like,
[03:09:52.220 --> 03:09:56.140]   okay, I got it through it. Cause when you're up there, it's not that you're like screaming nervous,
[03:09:56.140 --> 03:09:59.980]   but your hands will just won't work anymore. Something will happen, but that happens to everybody.
[03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:04.860]   If you really watch even the best in their live performances, watch really close and you see,
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:07.740]   they screw up a couple of things, but you just want to notice they just go right through it.
[03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:12.860]   It's like, it's about the live performance and that's why you know it's real. So I think if you
[03:10:12.860 --> 03:10:18.940]   can really just lean into it more, change, really work on the identity part, cause you've got the
[03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:25.580]   desire, you want to play guitar. But as soon as you say, yeah, but I can't play live. You just chopped
[03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:32.140]   off your leg at the start of the race. If you say, I, I don't know, you just chopped off your, you're
[03:10:32.140 --> 03:10:35.740]   doing this to yourself. You're literally doing this to yourself. I mean, just you, I mean,
[03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:41.820]   anybody who, who pauses, who hesitates, you don't have to have doubts. Why would you have a doubt?
[03:10:41.820 --> 03:10:46.620]   Cause you know, the process now it's like, if I don't know how to do something, I know how to figure
[03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:50.780]   it out. Like, I didn't know how I was going to do that scene with him jumping and flipping. I didn't
[03:10:50.780 --> 03:10:56.140]   know that, but do I have doubt that I'm going to go in there and be able to do it? If you, if you say
[03:10:56.140 --> 03:11:01.180]   that you do you, now you're a doubtful person. That's how powerful that is. But if you say, no,
[03:11:01.180 --> 03:11:03.900]   I don't have any doubt because I know I'm going to figure it out when I get there.
[03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:10.220]   somehow it'll fall in my lap. I trust the process. You don't have to, you don't have to know. So if
[03:11:10.220 --> 03:11:15.580]   you trust the process that you'll figure it out. But here's the thing, like sometimes you fail and
[03:11:15.580 --> 03:11:19.660]   there's audience. Yeah. Then you get four rooms. Yeah. Yeah. And then what happens? And then what
[03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:23.420]   happens? Right. Don't blink. Don't blink. And then you go sift through the failure. Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:23.420 --> 03:11:27.580]   You go, wait a minute. What did I get out of that? Yeah. I've done that a bunch. It's great.
[03:11:27.580 --> 03:11:32.460]   Look, what's the worst that can happen? You go on a stage and you bomb. It's not going to be the first
[03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:36.940]   stage. And it's one of those you can talk about so that when you do the next one and it all,
[03:11:36.940 --> 03:11:42.060]   sometimes they all go right. I've had a couple of shows. We did, we did a couple of shows where we had
[03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:45.660]   video cameras set up for the second day. Let's say, let's not film the first day because we're going to
[03:11:45.660 --> 03:11:50.940]   be fucking just finding our feet. Let's film the second day. First day was fucking flawless.
[03:11:50.940 --> 03:11:58.380]   Flawless because no cameras. It's like you just go. Second day, we weren't as into it as we had just
[03:11:58.380 --> 03:12:03.100]   done it. It felt like the second take, you know, it just didn't have the magic. And that's the one
[03:12:03.100 --> 03:12:08.060]   that's recorded. And we're like, oh, kicking ourselves. We didn't film both nights. We should
[03:12:08.060 --> 03:12:13.980]   have filmed both nights. I love how much of a mess this human existence life is. Yeah.
[03:12:15.020 --> 03:12:21.180]   You've talked about the importance of journaling because living is reliving. I love that phrase.
[03:12:21.180 --> 03:12:25.900]   I came up with that. Cause it's like, wow, I see so many people who get after you for like filming
[03:12:25.900 --> 03:12:31.660]   a concert and they go live in the moment. I'm like, dude, counterintuitive. The moment goes by like
[03:12:31.660 --> 03:12:36.140]   this. Yeah. We're not going to remember any of this. The fact that we taped it, thank God,
[03:12:36.140 --> 03:12:40.940]   because later on it's going to be a file photo of me remembering you three pound me computer. All I'm
[03:12:40.940 --> 03:12:46.060]   going to have is a file photo. You may be in a suit and you picturing me and maybe a black t-shirt
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:52.460]   and the metadata narrative is going to say, had a great talk about if we remember creativity,
[03:12:52.460 --> 03:12:58.140]   you know, like their brain doesn't remember. But when I pull up old home movies, I can show my kids
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:03.260]   that I just found and they're like, they don't remember it. I don't remember filming it. And it's
[03:13:03.260 --> 03:13:08.780]   like new adventures of it becomes iconic and it sticks in our head. And all our jokes are based on old
[03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:13.500]   things that we used to do and say. So reliving, living is reliving. So keeping a journal is very
[03:13:13.500 --> 03:13:17.260]   important because I found that anything that passed 15 years on, it's like I'm reading someone else's
[03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:21.020]   journal. I'm like, I didn't even know that's where I got that guitar. I thought I bought that
[03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:26.940]   guitar. It was given to me. It's like a $10,000 Santana. It was given to me my birthday by the studio
[03:13:26.940 --> 03:13:31.420]   that I made that movie. How did I not remember that? It's like crazy what you don't remember. And it's,
[03:13:31.420 --> 03:13:36.620]   the brain is very, it's not a, it's not a very reliable computer. It's, it's made out of
[03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:40.060]   frigging butter. That's a really profound idea that so much of our life
[03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:47.420]   is lived through replaying our memories. And then watching stuff is a, one of the ways to sort of
[03:13:47.420 --> 03:13:53.820]   refresh, give some more, you know, texture and details. Makes it iconic. It makes it iconic in
[03:13:53.820 --> 03:13:59.100]   your life and part of your life. Otherwise it just went by, it went by. Like I'll ask people like,
[03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:01.980]   we just had a really, what did we do last week? What did we do last Wednesday? And they're like,
[03:14:01.980 --> 03:14:06.780]   I can tell you because I wrote it down, but I'm going to remember. And then when you see,
[03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:12.220]   when you go through your journal, like I go back and I find, wow, life-changing
[03:14:13.180 --> 03:14:17.900]   thing happened Friday, another life-changing thing. I didn't know at the time until now. I know that
[03:14:17.900 --> 03:14:23.260]   that really set me on him happened Saturday and another big freaking thing happened on Sunday. Like
[03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:27.660]   they come in threes. Sometimes you start being able to predict the future a little bit. Cause you,
[03:14:27.660 --> 03:14:33.500]   you see the patterns and it's pretty wild to do that. And I've, I've talked to people,
[03:14:33.500 --> 03:14:36.860]   big group of people, 500 people. How many people here journal?
[03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:42.620]   Two hands, three hands. I couldn't believe it. It's like, man, you guys, if there's anything I'm
[03:14:42.620 --> 03:14:46.620]   going to part on you is journal, your life is way more interesting than you think, because it's not
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:51.260]   going to feel like anything while it's going by. But in retrospect, you look back, like I can just go
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:58.940]   through, I keep a journal one file per year. So I started a new one in 2025. If I'm going to look up,
[03:14:58.940 --> 03:15:03.740]   like I'm going to do a director's chair episode. I look up Michael Mann, Michael Mann, Michael Mann,
[03:15:03.740 --> 03:15:08.460]   all the conversations we had since 94 that I wrote down that I felt. And it's like, oh my God,
[03:15:08.460 --> 03:15:11.660]   I can't believe we said that. That's how I knew about that thing with Quentin. I had forgotten about
[03:15:11.660 --> 03:15:17.260]   that story with Quentin saying, ah, Pulp Fiction. I had forgotten that because from the moment I asked
[03:15:17.260 --> 03:15:22.700]   him that question to the success at Cannes was very quick. So it was a lost moment in time where I had
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:27.660]   it recorded down to the time, down to the hour. When I asked him that question, he thought it wasn't,
[03:15:27.660 --> 03:15:29.180]   he didn't think that was the one for him.
[03:15:29.180 --> 03:15:33.420]   Yeah. And there's a, I don't know when it, when it's private journaling,
[03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:38.860]   there's an honesty, there's an innocence that about like the dreams you have about the future,
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:42.620]   the conceptions you have about the future. I mean, that's what this thing is journal is a journal.
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:44.220]   It's just a journal. It's like,
[03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:46.300]   but the profundity like comes out of it.
[03:15:46.300 --> 03:15:49.420]   It's crazy. Yeah. You didn't. And so much I figured out then I was,
[03:15:49.420 --> 03:15:53.740]   I'm talking like a professor by the end of that. Like people come up to me and they're asking me all
[03:15:53.740 --> 03:15:57.660]   these questions about stuff I wrote in there. And I'm like, I wrote that in that book.
[03:15:57.900 --> 03:16:01.900]   Shit. I was smart back then. What happened? I don't remember half of that,
[03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:04.220]   but I think that it's the same thing. When you go to teach someone,
[03:16:04.220 --> 03:16:10.620]   your mouth opens and stuff comes out. I'm always taping myself. Like when I go to give a talk,
[03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:17.980]   cause that's also the pipe working. Someone else is talking to you sometimes. So the act of sharing,
[03:16:17.980 --> 03:16:23.100]   that's why I've always liked to share information. Cause the feedback loop is insane. Like me inspiring
[03:16:23.100 --> 03:16:27.660]   Daisy DJ to go, right. He writes the script in three days, comes back, tells me now I'm doing that
[03:16:27.660 --> 03:16:32.460]   method. And it's like, wow. People come back with their version. And I love telling my kids
[03:16:32.460 --> 03:16:39.020]   stuff that I learned that I wish I could tell myself, but I can't take a time machine. Closest thing is
[03:16:39.020 --> 03:16:42.460]   telling your kid. Cause then they can take that information and process. So many times they've
[03:16:42.460 --> 03:16:46.060]   come back and said, wow, dad, that lesson you taught us about this is really,
[03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:50.060]   it's really become big in our minds. Yeah. What was that? And they tell me, I'm like,
[03:16:50.060 --> 03:16:55.100]   I never told you that. They said, yeah, you told us, well, I told you maybe 10% of that.
[03:16:55.100 --> 03:16:59.340]   All the rest you added. Oh yeah. Well, we embellished it over. Like they turned it into
[03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:05.100]   something else. And it's like, wow, that's so cool. But yeah, that thing about reliving,
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:09.900]   like that was a, but one of my favorite was just, yeah, my mom turning 75 and not wanting to do
[03:17:10.540 --> 03:17:14.780]   anything for her 75th birthday. I said, why not? She goes, the whole family's going to,
[03:17:14.780 --> 03:17:17.100]   you have 10 kids. They're all going to want to do something for your 75th birthday.
[03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:22.300]   Nothing can top my 65th. I was like, what are we doing on your 65th? I didn't even remember even.
[03:17:22.300 --> 03:17:26.860]   I'm the one who orchestrated it all. She goes, oh, you flew everyone in from all over the country.
[03:17:26.860 --> 03:17:34.140]   You gave me a car. I gotta have a journal of that. So I'm sure I have video. I go back 10 years.
[03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:39.820]   I see what tape I had it on, find the tape, pop the tape in, forgot about all this stuff. So
[03:17:39.820 --> 03:17:44.060]   I cut together a 10 minute version of it, showed it at her 75th birthday.
[03:17:44.060 --> 03:17:49.980]   Just watching the old one, everybody was like, oh my God, look how young everybody was. Like
[03:17:49.980 --> 03:17:55.020]   how small the nieces and nephews were. She starts bawling as soon as she gets the key,
[03:17:55.020 --> 03:17:59.020]   the gift of the key in the video, because she realizes now what it's going to mean that she's
[03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:04.300]   going to get this car. And so it's like, wow, let's just play the old tapes. We don't even have
[03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:09.100]   to do anything anymore. We banked so much amazing stuff that we've all forgotten,
[03:18:09.100 --> 03:18:16.380]   that my kids just love watching their old home movies. They hardly remember any of it, but
[03:18:16.380 --> 03:18:24.220]   even a VHS to them is virtual reality because compared to our memories, it is virtual reality.
[03:18:24.220 --> 03:18:28.540]   They're like leaning into the screen to see what's around the corner and they're remembering the place
[03:18:28.540 --> 03:18:34.620]   and the sounds. And they say, oh, we left the, we left the living room. It's like, we're there. It's
[03:18:34.620 --> 03:18:39.820]   like, wow. I was always afraid they would see this old footage and go, ah, that's a dog shit. What kind of
[03:18:39.820 --> 03:18:43.740]   camera was that? This is the limitations of, you know, you put up one of those files on your screen.
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:49.100]   It's like this big on your laptop. That's how low res shit was back then, but that didn't matter. It's
[03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:54.460]   like compared to our memories, that stuff, living is reliving, like pull up that, shoot as much as you
[03:18:54.460 --> 03:18:58.220]   can, take as many pictures, but write the journal. Cause you'll have a picture. You swear, you're not
[03:18:58.220 --> 03:19:01.100]   going to know what it's from. Even 10 years from now, you want to know what that picture's from.
[03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:06.940]   You read the diary. Oh, that's what that is. Oh my God. You can piece together all these things that
[03:19:06.940 --> 03:19:11.740]   are important to you or that become more important with time actually. And, uh, you know, what's
[03:19:11.740 --> 03:19:16.060]   important later compared to what's happening at the time to add on top of that. So journaling is the kind
[03:19:16.060 --> 03:19:21.980]   of raw or like home films is a raw projection of what's going on in the moment. I think it's also
[03:19:21.980 --> 03:19:28.140]   really powerful because I've done that is to do a high effort description of where your life is
[03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:31.340]   for your, just for yourself. So sometimes journaling is like low effort.
[03:19:31.340 --> 03:19:34.940]   Yeah. Sometimes it's just, I just want to mark that, you know, we had this conversation. I had
[03:19:34.940 --> 03:19:39.340]   to go do something at five. I did that, met somebody that I know last night I met somebody that's going
[03:19:39.340 --> 03:19:42.460]   to be life changing. I'm going to write a little bit more on that. Cause I could just, now I know,
[03:19:42.460 --> 03:19:45.580]   but I'm going to just record it. So later if I look it up.
[03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:49.820]   So one of the cool things you could do is, you know, like, uh, for example, somebody, um, uh,
[03:19:49.820 --> 03:19:54.620]   Jamie, Mr. Beast does, does these videos, which are great. I think it's a great exercise
[03:19:54.620 --> 03:20:00.300]   to do for yourself, which is a video he records, uh, for himself that he doesn't look at to be
[03:20:00.300 --> 03:20:05.340]   published 20 years from now. This is a message to myself 20 years from now. Here's where I hope
[03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:10.220]   you end up. You're, you're basically a younger version of yourself speaking to an older version.
[03:20:10.220 --> 03:20:14.540]   Yeah. And then you get, you know, time flies and like, you get to a point where it's like,
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:18.620]   holy shit, it has been 10 years. It has been 20 years. You get to listen to a younger version of
[03:20:18.620 --> 03:20:25.420]   yourself. Like you, it would have been hilarious if you shot videos like that to yourself. Cause
[03:20:25.420 --> 03:20:29.660]   it was just like the incredible journey of your career has been on. And just to think about that,
[03:20:29.660 --> 03:20:36.700]   like the Delta, the difference between what your dreams were, where you ended up, usually you outdo
[03:20:36.700 --> 03:20:41.340]   yourself in many ways. Sometimes you, your life goes in a totally different trajectory. That's,
[03:20:41.340 --> 03:20:46.220]   it's, um, and the result is kind of funny. It's a, it's a, it's a nice,
[03:20:46.220 --> 03:20:51.180]   it's a nice illustration of the nonlinearity of life.
[03:20:51.180 --> 03:20:54.780]   I would film stuff like that with my kids. I couldn't do it. I would film my kids saying,
[03:20:54.780 --> 03:20:59.820]   hey, turn to the camera now and say, hey rebel, it's me rebel rebel in the future.
[03:20:59.820 --> 03:21:01.820]   Yeah. So you have shots like that.
[03:21:01.820 --> 03:21:05.820]   Yeah. And then they show them like, cool, like that 10 years later. And they, they're like, whoa,
[03:21:05.820 --> 03:21:11.020]   just to see it talking to them and saying, yeah. And, um, I would do this thing where
[03:21:11.420 --> 03:21:18.860]   I would film them watching it and then pan off. So that 10 years later I could get,
[03:21:18.860 --> 03:21:24.620]   hey rebel, him reacting, pan off to the new rebel watching it. It's just like keeps going. So I have
[03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:27.900]   one like that where it just keeps panning and they're watching themselves within the movie,
[03:21:27.900 --> 03:21:31.900]   within the movie, within the movie. It's like an ongoing project. You know, it's just so fun to just
[03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:39.180]   play with memory and make you realize how fast time moves and to go, they go like,
[03:21:40.140 --> 03:21:46.140]   I kind of remember that, but I don't remember being that tiny when I had that memory. It's like
[03:21:46.140 --> 03:21:53.500]   wild how time moves and it makes them feel much more precious about how quick time moves and how
[03:21:53.500 --> 03:21:57.340]   important every little moment is because you see the fragility of it too. You know,
[03:21:57.340 --> 03:22:02.700]   does it make you sad, break your heart that, you know, the number of memories we get to create is
[03:22:02.700 --> 03:22:06.300]   finite, that this life ends. Eventually the story is over.
[03:22:07.900 --> 03:22:12.060]   I had this theory, I'm going to put this in a movie. I don't think I've ever seen this before,
[03:22:12.060 --> 03:22:16.300]   because I was woke up from a dream and it was like, trying to remember it. You know, you're like, God,
[03:22:16.300 --> 03:22:21.980]   it's so, so real. If you don't write it down right away, right? It kind of fades away. But you,
[03:22:21.980 --> 03:22:27.500]   while you're dreaming it, it's really real. And it's like, you can almost see the walls.
[03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:32.540]   By the time I went to go tell somebody, it's like, "Shit, I forgot most of it." But I wonder if that's what it's
[03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:38.140]   like when you wake up in your consciousness after you die. You wake up in your next consciousness,
[03:22:38.140 --> 03:22:42.140]   getting ready to move into whatever your next body is. And you're like, "Wow, I was a filmmaker,
[03:22:42.140 --> 03:22:52.060]   had five kids? And, oh, well, I'm going to be a fish now." It's like a dream. It's like that gone
[03:22:52.060 --> 03:22:56.620]   that way. And it's like, that's what past lives are. They're like distant memories, like a dream that's
[03:22:56.620 --> 03:23:01.980]   faded away. That's why you barely feel remnants of it. Do I feel sad about it? When I tell people,
[03:23:01.980 --> 03:23:07.020]   they flip out when I tell them that. I want a character to be like that. He's dying. He's like,
[03:23:07.020 --> 03:23:11.820]   "I don't want to forget this dream. I don't want to forget. Don't let me wake up. Don't let me wake up."
[03:23:11.820 --> 03:23:15.900]   But you forget, especially the moment you try to tell somebody. You tell the next fish over.
[03:23:15.900 --> 03:23:23.100]   Yeah, the next fish, there'll be a fish next. But yeah, it feels like I'm a little sad about it,
[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:27.020]   but then it just makes you even more double down to be precious about the life you're in now.
[03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:31.820]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing of life? Why are we here?
[03:23:31.820 --> 03:23:41.260]   I mean, I really feel like my kids and I were just talking about this last night. We were just
[03:23:41.260 --> 03:23:47.500]   blown away. We did this Asterian astrology thing. It was the oldest form of astrology. It just nails
[03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:54.620]   each person. And it's like, yeah, because when you have a kid, you realize right away, this isn't my
[03:23:54.620 --> 03:23:59.260]   kid. This is not my, I'm just in charge of him. It's a completely different soul. He's a different soul
[03:23:59.260 --> 03:24:03.420]   that ended up in my hands. It's not, there's physical characteristics that get passed on
[03:24:03.420 --> 03:24:08.780]   because of just how biology works. Even sometimes posture and movement is the same,
[03:24:08.780 --> 03:24:12.940]   but the actual person is somebody else. And all the kids, I have five kids and I had nine brothers
[03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:18.380]   and sisters. They're all different. And you realize we made a pact in the past life
[03:24:19.020 --> 03:24:25.740]   to gather together. Cause every time it's like, so good. You were born in this family
[03:24:25.740 --> 03:24:29.820]   because you were given free reign to go find who you're really supposed to be. And you, and you find
[03:24:29.820 --> 03:24:35.420]   out everyone's is doing what they were supposed to be doing. But what's cool, almost like this clarity
[03:24:35.420 --> 03:24:41.740]   you get by just saying it, they now know that they were always supposed to be like this creative person
[03:24:41.740 --> 03:24:44.700]   or that. And now they can double down on it. Cause they know that's who they were supposed to be.
[03:24:44.700 --> 03:24:48.540]   They don't have to have any doubt anymore. They don't have to wonder, well, am I supposed to be
[03:24:48.540 --> 03:24:52.780]   more business minded or can I be creative? Isn't that some kind of frivolous? Is that a real job?
[03:24:52.780 --> 03:24:57.980]   Can I do that? Now they realize, no, you're supposed to be doing that for these, these, these reasons.
[03:24:57.980 --> 03:25:02.860]   And now they can double down. You can skip all that and just decide, I feel like I want to be that
[03:25:02.860 --> 03:25:08.700]   person. So I'm just going to declare I am that person. And as soon as you say it, you are that.
[03:25:08.700 --> 03:25:16.700]   And tomorrow your, your activities will conform to that. That's how powerful that decision is.
[03:25:16.700 --> 03:25:22.700]   So when you walk out of here, it's going to be with a complete commitment. I'm a technical and
[03:25:22.700 --> 03:25:28.380]   creative person. Like my first boss, I'm unstoppable. Cause my boss told me that and
[03:25:28.380 --> 03:25:33.500]   he was right. I became technical and creative and you're just unstoppable. You can just keep going
[03:25:33.500 --> 03:25:37.420]   and just go, I'm unstoppable. That's me. You're going to do, you know, use your powers for bad,
[03:25:37.420 --> 03:25:43.660]   but you've just changed your life by just declaring that. And I'm also a creative person who lives his
[03:25:43.660 --> 03:25:49.900]   life creatively. I'm going to find creative ways to use that technology. If somebody says you're not the
[03:25:49.900 --> 03:25:55.660]   same kind of artist I was expecting, that's their own opinion. Don't blink, just keep going. You know,
[03:25:55.660 --> 03:25:59.500]   all these things that you've learned that people were supposed to tell you along the way,
[03:25:59.500 --> 03:26:05.020]   they're telling you for a reason. Anytime you got pushed, like if you go back to your life at your
[03:26:05.020 --> 03:26:10.620]   really critical moments in your life where you went that way, instead of that way, there was probably
[03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:17.500]   somebody there who said something to you that kind of pushed you. I, there was a, there was one guy
[03:26:17.500 --> 03:26:23.260]   when I was in high school, it was like senior year. I wrote a paper and I wasn't a great writer at all.
[03:26:23.260 --> 03:26:29.420]   I wrote a paper for a Latin American studies class, gave it to the teacher. And, uh, he said, wow, you,
[03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:34.540]   you're going to be rich and famous in four years. It's based on what I read.
[03:26:35.260 --> 03:26:42.540]   He was like, really flight home like 17 or 18, four years later, I've done mariachi. And I went to him
[03:26:42.540 --> 03:26:47.100]   later at a reunion and I said, you called it. You said I was going to be, why did you say that? And
[03:26:47.100 --> 03:26:51.900]   he's like, I said, it looked like he would never say that to somebody. You'd think he would own it
[03:26:51.900 --> 03:26:55.660]   and say, Oh yeah, I knew. And I told you, no, he was like, he'd look like he didn't even know who
[03:26:55.660 --> 03:27:00.460]   that was asking. I feel like he never would have said that in a million years. So again,
[03:27:00.460 --> 03:27:04.540]   sometimes things come out of our mouth. That's not us. It comes through us. So if you think of it that
[03:27:04.540 --> 03:27:09.820]   way, why are we here? We're here for a reason. We're going to get nudged along, listen to the signs,
[03:27:09.820 --> 03:27:15.100]   own who you're supposed to be. Cause you're, you are that person. Don't let your human doubt get in the
[03:27:15.100 --> 03:27:19.260]   way. That's like the guy closing the pipe. Oh, I don't know if I'm really creative. I don't know if I'm
[03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:23.100]   really a businessman and you're just closing the pipe. You're not going to let it flow.
[03:27:23.100 --> 03:27:29.020]   Just be a good pipe. Just say, I just want to be a, I just want to be a good pipe, clean open.
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:33.500]   And then that's when the magic happens. And no matter what, don't blink, don't blink.
[03:27:33.500 --> 03:27:37.740]   No matter how many that dude was getting so much shit thrown at him. I wish you
[03:27:37.740 --> 03:27:41.180]   knew that time period. Cause then you wouldn't, you would go like, yeah, that's right. It's incredible.
[03:27:41.180 --> 03:27:45.420]   It was unbelievable. I can't even convey. There was no internet and stuff back then. This was like
[03:27:45.420 --> 03:27:52.620]   literal press reviews public. It was like, why are they targeting this guy? You know,
[03:27:52.620 --> 03:27:59.020]   they just did not like, he just had unprecedented success and was a really great guy and was making
[03:27:59.020 --> 03:28:06.060]   amazing shit. So it was the, the triple threat of make people jealous. Well, he's one of the great
[03:28:06.060 --> 03:28:11.660]   artists of all time. So are you. It's a huge honor to talk to you. Thank you for everything you're
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:16.700]   doing in the world, for creating the world and for inspiring millions of people to also be creators
[03:28:16.700 --> 03:28:21.180]   in the world and for your new project that's bringing people in. Robert, I'm, as I told you,
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:23.500]   I'm a huge fan. I appreciate that. It's a huge honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:28:23.500 --> 03:28:26.060]   So great talking with you. Great questions. You're going to change your life.
[03:28:26.060 --> 03:28:29.420]   Thank you, brother. Million dollars. Yeah. Right there.
[03:28:29.420 --> 03:28:33.500]   Thank you for listening to this conversation with Robert Rodriguez.

[03:28:37.340 --> 03:28:41.020]   And now let me leave you with some words from Alfred Hitchcock.
[03:28:41.020 --> 03:28:49.660]   Thank you. In feature films, the director is God. In documentary films, God is the director.
[03:28:49.660 --> 03:28:53.500]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:28:53.500 --> 03:29:03.180]   Thank you.
