[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   or from poultry to a rabbitry or to raising some beef cattle or milk cattle or whatever you do and you keep transitioning. And all along the way, you're practicing those business skills. Now, if you did that for a few years, you would now have the confidence from having done it that you could be plucked up from the middle of Indiana and plopped down in the middle of Wisconsin and do exactly the same thing because you've done it once. And then you could have the confidence that you could be plucked up out of a food operation and you could be put into an artisan handshake.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:53.520]   a way to kind of show your qualifications. Do you think that would be the most I mean, because I picture if I get laid off as a diesel technician, I want to go become a salesperson. At least at the large company I work for, I have trouble walking and saying like I should qualify for this good salary job because I sold $5,000 a year worth of chickens. With a blog kind of demonstrating that you think there's a better way to sort of demonstrate that value.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:22.660]  , for potential employers.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   Maybe that one's hard because if you're trying to prepare yourself for a career change that you're not actively moving into or that you're not currently working in it, it's a little bit harder to build that kind of thing, especially to make it worth the time. So I think everybody needs a career website that's related to themselves, their career and their business. The trick is with a career website, it should be related to either what you're doing or what you actively want to do. So do you actually have a career website that's related to your career?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   So do you actually have a career website that's related to your career?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   a career website that's related to either what you're doing or what you actively want to do?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   So do you actively want to build that career website that's related to your career?
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.700]   So do you actually want to transition out of your technician role to a sales role?
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.700]   So do you actually want to transition out of your technician role to a sales role?
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.700]   I don't know if I want to transition to a sales role, but I do eventually want to transition out of the technician role.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.700]   I don't know if I want to transition to a sales role, but I do eventually want to transition out of the technician role.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   Okay. So the way that I would see a blog or a career website, because a blog is just one function of it, fitting into that, is you develop a website for the particular career that you want to pursue.

[00:23:47.240 --> 00:24:12.740]   and laying the groundwork for it, you should have a specific goal of a specific career or a specific company that you want to work for.

[00:25:43.100 --> 00:26:11.360]   didnt want to talk about?ï¿½ Because they don't usually pay salespeople unless they actually produce. You can go and you can get sales jobs. So I'm not worried about your ability to get a sales job. I would focus on building the lifestyle job first, which is probably related to the big property that you bought, and there should be enough profit there that you could learn the lessons and apply those elsewhere.

[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:42.920]  obedient. I'd like to ask about, I've had a change in status this year, recently married, and because of that we've been making some Roth contributions on our own individually, but I think combined, our income is going to exceed the IRS limitation. So I guess part of my question is, my initial thought was to do a backdoor Roth, kind of recategorize it into a traditional Roth.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.140]   ï¿½ï¿½
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:27:13.180]   and then move it back over into a Roth. But I thought I'd ask, so one, I'd like to ask either, is that the best option or should I look into something else? And then B, if it's the best option, is it just mechanically that, just having a traditional IRA and moving it into there and then moving it back over into the Roth, kind of get some of the details ironed out in my head about actually how to execute that, or should I just see a CPA or something?
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:23.360]  ÐµÑ‡

[00:28:42.080 --> 00:29:11.480]   methyl. I don't think it did. There is. I'm my brain is going down, married filing jointly. Um, and because of your married filing jointly income is a hundred. The range is less than a hundred ninety three thousand. You contribute over two hundred three thousand. You can't contribute. But with two hundred and thirty thousand, you're over that. Um, married filing separately. You have, you can't contribute anything if you make more than ten grand. So that doesn't work. Um, singled, if you did not live with your spouse at any time of the year.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:40.100]   You stumped me. So I get my best guess is I would talk with the CPA and see your accountant and that would be a good good. Um, a good question for a tax specialist. But my guess to your answer is you can't do a Roth IRA. So could you do a backdoor, a backdoor Roth? Yeah, you could do a backdoor Roth for you to simply contribute to a non deductible IRA and then convert it to a Roth IRA. Is that worth your time and worth the hassle with two hundred and thirty thousand dollars of income?
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.300]   You'd be the one who's going to pay for it.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:30:11.620]   I'm going to have to say that I think it's a good question.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   I'm going to have to say that I think it's a good question.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   Yeah, I'm going to have to say that I think it's a good question.

[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:21.460]   Um, yeah, I'll definitely reach out, maybe find someone that I can trust and see about what the best steps are.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.800]   It's a fairly simple question for a tax preparer.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.120]   Right, right.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.060]   It should be pretty straightforward.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:34.140]   I just don't want to run into any, you know, crazy, hairy stuff when I start preparing taxes.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.040]   I want to get it done.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.080]   Well, thanks for that.

[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.180]  , you know, there's a lot of people who are like, oh, well, they're not going to be able to pay the mortgage or the debtor laws there versus having the mortgage on something, the debt on something else. So that's, that's, those are basically my arguments. I would love it if you paid cash for a house. I think that's great. Just don't make the mistake of thinking that by putting 50% down, you're safer. You're not. You're safer to put 10% down, keep the other 40% in cash, and then wait until you can pay it off 100%, then make the payments and pay it off 100%. Okay, thank you. My pleasure. Hope that made sense.

[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:20.600]   and then finally, as a way of earning money,
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.580]   and then finally, as a way of earning money,
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.520]   the friction of paying advisory fees,
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.780]   when you take fees off of the management of assets,
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.500]   it's a very low friction event for the client.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   when you take fees off of the management of assets,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   it's a very low friction event for the client.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   and then finally, as a way of earning money,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   and then finally, as a way of earning money,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   and then finally, as a way of earning money,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   and then finally, as a way of paying advisory fees,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.500]   and then finally, as a way of paying advisory fees, and then you're not paying advisory fees, and then you're not paying advisory fees.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   and then finally, as a way of earning money,
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   which is why most people don't mind paying fees
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   which is why most people don't mind paying fees
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   because it's low friction.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   it has a low saliency.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   I know my advisor deducts the quarterly fees,
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   but whatever, it's just coming off my portfolio.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   Now, when somebody looks at it and says,
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   well, what would happen if you get 1% underperformance over the course of 40 years?
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   It's a big number, which is why you better be, if you're going to be doing that business,
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   you better be confident you're doing everything you can to deliver far bigger than that number, which is for most people, for most advisors at least, probably a hard thing to do.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   For most people, for most advisors at least, probably a hard thing to do.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   Because it's the best way to do.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:31.540]  , but in terms of getting paid from a business owner perspective,
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:31.540]   there's no, I don't know of any lower friction way to get paid where your business model works other than managing assets.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:31.540]   When you take the custodianship of assets away, you get very high salient fees and now it becomes a much harder business to pursue. Where now, here's one of the complaints of the financial advisor business. People say,
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.760]   I've got a net worth of,
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.120]   let's just say $5 million,
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:34.480]   right?
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.380]   Wealthy guys,
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:37.240]   we're going to deal in the world of wealthy people.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.160]   I've got a net worth of $5 million.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.140]   But I've got to invest,
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:43.040]   but $2 million of that is in real estate,
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.500]   $2 million is in my business,
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.140]   and $1 million of that is in my 401k.
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:48.000]   So Mr. Financial Advisor,
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:48.740]   here's $1 million.
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.300]   Well, Financial Advisor says,
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:51.840]   all right,
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.080]   well,
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.280]   I'll charge you,
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:53.760]   you know,
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.460]   150 basis points on that.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.340]   So I'm going to get $15,000 off your $1 million.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:59.080]   And now all of a sudden,
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.860]   you're in a situation where,
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.340]   wait,
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:01.560]   I'm going to get $15,000 off your $1 million.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:01.560]  ,
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:10.680]   won
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.520]  sty of take
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:26.900]  , .,--,æ„› what partê² ë 13
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:38.740]   of the debt.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:41.960]   So some advisors charge their fees based upon,
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.560]   not based upon assets under management,
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.700]   but based upon net worth.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.400]   I've not met many clients who like that.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.360]   Even though the client might understand, well,
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:57.360]   maybe that's going to release a conflict of interest
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.960]   and smooth things out a little bit, I don't see what impact
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   I don't see what impact you're going to make.
