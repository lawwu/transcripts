[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.560]   It's Friday and that means live Q&A.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement that you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.160]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.960]   I didn't get it out in one breath.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.600]   I'm losing my skill.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.240]   Today it's Friday and that means live Q&A, just like talk radio.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:52.520]   Any Friday that I can, which has not been as many as I wanted to, we do live Q&A.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.480]   I open these shows up to any of the patrons of the show, which are people who sign up
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   to support Radical Personal Finance on Patreon.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400]   If you would like to do that, you can go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.040]   If you sign up on patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance to support the show, then you get access to
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440]   these call-in shows.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.000]   It works just like call-in talk radio, where any listener can call in and we chat about
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.120]   whatever the listener wants.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.400]   It can be comments on the show, it can be specific questions, it can be ideas, et cetera.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.120]   We begin with Andy in Indiana.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.760]   Andy, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.880]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.760]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.600]   I am curious how you would encourage building career confidence when you don't have a lot
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.920]   of time to spend building a successful side job and/or don't want to make the costly decision
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.600]   of lowering your income by switching to a near career field that I'm not qualified in
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   yet.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   You are in a career currently.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.240]   You are gainfully employed, but in your current career, you don't feel like there's much potential?
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.720]   What's the problem you're facing?
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.240]   I get the impression from you and other people that I feel like you feel as though you could
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.960]   lose everything, walk out and in a year be making the same money you're making now and
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.680]   very confident that you have marketable skills that you could use in lots of different places
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.360]   and always be able to earn an income doing what you're doing.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   My job, I make good money.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm in a union, so I feel like probably making more than my skills and services are necessarily
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   worth.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.240]   I would like to not feel that way and have more backup plans and confidence that I could
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.080]   get a good job anywhere making the kind of money I would like to make.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.760]   I don't want to just quit my job and go cut my income in half and do that to my family.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.720]   I also don't want to get two jobs and work 90 hours a week and never see my family.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   Right.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   Okay.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   I understand a little bit more.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.760]   I think one of the differences would be the kind of skills that one person has versus
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.040]   another.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.480]   So it sounds like your primary work is in kind of a skilled trade.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480]   Is that right?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   Yes.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.760]   I kind of on the less skilled end of the skilled trade, but yes.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   Okay.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.440]   So that's a big difference versus the kind of skills that I usually think of that come
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   from my personal skill set.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.400]   So I've always been interested in business.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:50.000]   And the thing about business in and of itself is that every business works about the same.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.380]   There's just different kinds of products or different kinds of services that's actually
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.740]   being sold.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.680]   But at its core, Google is exactly the same as Hewlett Packard is exactly the same as
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.600]   a big steel company.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.320]   In the fact that there's a product that's being sold to a customer for a profit.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.960]   And then there are various business functions that can be applied along the way.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.920]   A business is in terms of its definition, a business is a repeatable process that creates
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.260]   and delivers something of value that other people want or need at a price they're willing
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.460]   to pay in a way that satisfies the customer's needs and expectations so that the business
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.340]   brings in sufficient profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.800]   Credit to Josh Kaufman for his excellent definition of business that I have just told to you.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.840]   So that's the definition of a business.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.640]   I'll repeat, a business is a repeatable process that creates and delivers something of value
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.460]   that other people want or need at a price they're willing to pay in a way that satisfies
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.960]   the customer's needs and expectations so that the business brings in sufficient profit to
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.700]   make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.840]   So I consider myself to be competent in business.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.820]   And when I think about skills, I immediately go to those different aspects of the marketplace.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.640]   And so, and just to kind of continue Kaufman's way of analyzing it, he defines those as being
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.440]   the five basic parts of a business.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.540]   There's value creation, which is discovering what people need, want, or could be encouraged
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.700]   to want, and then creating it.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.180]   That's the process of value creation.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.900]   Again, discovering what people need, want, or could be encouraged to want, and then creating
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.900]   it.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.600]   The second function is marketing.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.540]   Marketing is attracting attention and building demand for what you've created.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.580]   Then the third function of business is sales, turning prospective customers into paying
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.360]   customers by completing a transaction.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.180]   The fourth function is value delivery, which is giving your customers what you've promised
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.380]   and then ensuring they're satisfied with the transaction.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.340]   And then the fifth function is finance.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.580]   And finance is making sure that a business is bringing in enough money to keep it going
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.060]   and then to make the effort worthwhile.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.900]   It's got to be profitable enough for the owners to want to actually continue being involved
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.300]   in the business.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.740]   So if you understand those five basic functions of every single business, then you now have
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.500]   a blueprint to drive on.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.460]   And so one of the things that I teach when I'm teaching career planning is I teach that
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.660]   you want to develop economically valuable skills.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.960]   So economically valuable skills are going to be skills that are tightly related to one
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.580]   of those five areas of a business, most likely.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.060]   And so when you develop those skill sets and you understand how a business operates, then
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.380]   it gives you the personal confidence to be able to move out of one business and move
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.100]   into another business.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.600]   Simple example from my story.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.440]   One of the reasons I went into insurance and investment product sales was I wanted to learn
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.840]   how to sell.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.820]   Because once you know how to sell and you understand the process and the dynamics and
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.020]   the tools and the techniques of selling, that's now a skill set that can be applied to any
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   business.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.860]   So today, since once I learned how to sell, once I learned how to deal with the emotions
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.580]   of being a salesman, once I learned how to deal with how the funnel works and how you
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.260]   develop leads, how you solve needs, the core functions of selling, which are really well
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.580]   defined at this point in time, that's a skill set that I could take from selling life insurance
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.420]   and I could move it to selling property and casualty insurance.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.860]   Or I could move it to selling mutual funds, or I can move it to selling real estate, or
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.500]   I can move it to selling yachts, or I could move it to selling rural farmland, or I could
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.900]   move it to selling high-end watches, or I could move it to selling anything, you know,
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.500]   giant 747s, they don't make those, 787s for Boeing.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.780]   It's all sales and it's the same basic process, you just have a slightly different marketplace.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.980]   And so once you learn those skills in one place, you can now go and take those to another
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.980]   place.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.020]   Now, one of the things that I have done over the last few years is I've been building digital
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:17.220]   sales skills, which are every bit as translatable, if not more so than those other sales skills.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.260]   And so if you break down the sales process of a digital business, an internet business
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:27.340]   like I'm engaged in right now, you can break it down into attracting an audience, building
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.980]   products and services, developing sales funnels.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.100]   It's broken down into specific tangible skills, such as copywriting or media production.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.660]   And that can be as technical as how to edit an audio file, or how to create a website,
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.380]   or how to edit a video file, or it can be on the sales side, how to develop marketing
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.420]   copy and sales speech that effectively conveys the point.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.060]   Or it can be research, how to research what people want to buy so that you can create
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.940]   what people want to buy.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.820]   So these are, as I consider the basic skills of business.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.980]   So I could, in fact, I have tons of domain names of other brands.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.660]   I think constantly, okay, if radical personal finance fails, or if I don't want to do it
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.700]   anymore, what would be the other brand that I would develop?
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.460]   And where would I, how would I, what else would I sell?
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.220]   And what other market would I work in?
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.220]   And why?
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.220]   What are the benefits of those other markets?
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.700]   So the reason why I have that confidence and why many people have that self, that confidence
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.460]   is because those skills are more skills in the area of business where they can be picked
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.920]   up and plunked from one place to another.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.200]   Now when you're dealing with manual skills, instead of those business skills, and you
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:44.140]   are a craftsman at the high end, or you're a laborer at the entry level, it's much more
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.860]   limited because it's not as transferable.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.500]   So the first, your career path is different.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.300]   It has to look different than because it's not as immediately translatable over.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.860]   So your first goal is to go from a commodity to a specialty.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.100]   If you had no skills whatsoever on the job site, you just simply had your physical strength,
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.100]   right?
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.500]   Well, that in and of itself is a skill that some people don't have, but you have physical
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.580]   strength, you have good health, you can show up on the job site at 7 a.m., you can work
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.180]   till 5 and you can give an honest day's work.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.100]   Well that's good and it can be directed, but there are lots of people who have that.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.940]   So the first thing that you've got to work for is to develop specialized skills, and
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.980]   that's what starts to take you up the wage marketplace.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.080]   Once you develop specialized skills, you'll have more career resiliency and more confidence
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   that you could transfer.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.380]   Andy, are you willing to share with me what industry you work in, in general or specific?
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:48.580]   Yeah, so I'm a certified diesel test technician, so I do engine testing.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:54.900]   And so I guess I would be relatively confident, I mean, there's, I don't know, probably five
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.540]   or six places in the country that do what I do and I could probably move to one of those
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:07.180]   places in another state and get another union job making similar to what I do.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:13.500]   But if I were to want to stay in the same area, I would basically either have to work
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:19.060]   for the company I work for now or go to work as a shop tech, which would be probably a
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.260]   50% pay cut, even with the certifications and skills that I have now.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.700]   And I probably could never max out making what I make today in that career, unless I
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.220]   own my own shop or something.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:40.220]   And so the reason for that in your career is simply the skill that you've developed
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.740]   is very specialized, but there's only a small handful of places where you could get that
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.740]   job.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.780]   There's a half a dozen places across the United States.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.300]   Now if you compare that from what I just talked about with regard to business skills, business
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.620]   skills are transferable.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.540]   There are 100,000 businesses right within a 10 mile radius of your house.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.180]   And business skills can be applied to any one of those businesses.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:11.540]   And so the problem is that you don't have a big enough market for your diesel engine
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.340]   test and certification skills, because there's only six companies that are doing that in
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.980]   the United States.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.600]   So if you're going to build career resilience and you're going to build that confidence,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.380]   the first thing you're going to have to do is you're going to have to move into a market
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.100]   where there's more opportunity, if you care, right?
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.620]   Some people, it's fine to have six companies, and if you'd be willing to move, et cetera.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:42.100]   But if you were to compare your personal expertise versus being a heavy diesel engine mechanic,
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.460]   wouldn't you think that there'd be a lot more confidence if you were working as a heavy
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.500]   diesel engine mechanic and a lot more opportunity right in your local area than what you're
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   doing right now?
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   Yes, probably.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.500]   Right.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.060]   So in that context, if you move to just simply being a heavy diesel engine mechanic, and
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.660]   that was the field that you were working in, you could translate that, whether it's working
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:09.780]   on big Caterpillar front end, big bulldozers, or working on combines, or working on diesel
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.500]   pickup trucks, or working on diesel tugboat engines, there's tremendous applicability
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.500]   of that.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.340]   And so in your situation, further specialization with a piece of equipment is probably unwarranted.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.820]   And rather, you should probably go back to generalize, something that's going to have
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.620]   a broader application for you to build that resiliency.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.860]   And what I would be doing if I were you is I would at least be understanding how to do
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.660]   that in case you did get fired.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:42.340]   Just because you get fired doesn't mean you want to go across the country.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.980]   So excuse me, I've been talking too much today.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.460]   What I would do is I would lay out a career path.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.960]   So let's say you lost your job or wanted to leave your job.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.220]   Maybe you take a job as an entry level grunt, but I would very quickly line myself up with
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:05.220]   how I would move into a higher end position as a highly qualified diesel, heavy diesel
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.700]   engine mechanic, and lay out the education path at the very minimum.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.860]   And then even better would be to at least start the process of gaining the knowledge
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.480]   or the certification.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:24.900]   So you could move quickly into a career that has a broader range of draw.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.700]   That's how I would develop more confidence.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.660]   >>Jeremy: And I guess part of that, I'm not super wedded to my career.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.900]   I don't think I really want to do this long term.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:42.180]   So I would be totally open to learning business skills or another trade or all sorts of other
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.180]   things.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.260]   And then I guess it seems like I can think of lots of ways to do that, but they're all
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:56.420]   relatively costly in the sense of lost income and my current job by switching or significant
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.420]   time investment.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:04.020]   So I'm curious if you had any sort of, I hesitate to say quick and easy, but like simple things
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.140]   that I could be doing beyond just, well, this is what I would do if I got fired.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.140]   >>Trey: Right.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.140]   Doable.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.140]   Well, I like the word doable.
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.220]   Do you have some ideas that are doable?
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.940]   Not quick and easy, but doable.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.500]   So you're working 40 hours a week and are you single, married, have children?
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:28.180]   >>Jeremy: So I actually, I have just transitioned to pretty much an ideal work and situation.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.900]   I work 36 hours a week, three 12 hour shifts, weekend nights, and then I'm free during the
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.900]   week.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.500]   But I have a wife and a couple young children, similar age to yours, and we're trying to
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.860]   just develop, like we've bought a large piece of property and want to have animals and that's
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:53.500]   kind of what the family lifestyle goal is, which is in and of itself somewhat time consuming.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.500]   >>Trey: Right.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.500]   Right.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.740]   So you can kind of think through what you're trying to do.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.540]   So if you're looking for business skills, business skills are present in every business
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.780]   where you're not, and you can learn them at any business where you're not solely a technician.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.180]   So if you've just bought land and you want to raise animals, build your side business
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.660]   with land.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.660]   How much land do you have?
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.660]   >>Jeremy: 26 acres.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:25.460]   >>Trey: So with 26 acres in your market, you can start doing pastured poultry, selling
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.460]   chickens.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.780]   I don't know what area of interest you're most interested in, but you could start, again,
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.460]   pastured poultry is probably your fastest solution.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.620]   You start building out fruit crops, perennial crops.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.820]   You might do a little bit of truck farming if there's a market in your local area for
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.820]   that.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.420]   You start putting some hogs on the back 10 acres, maybe get a couple of cows.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.740]   You think through the market, I don't know, raise tilapia, raise micro greens, whatever
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.380]   the particular area of interest is.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.340]   If you have young children, you're trying to build that with something like you're describing
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.740]   where you're only working three days per week, but in 12 hour shifts, that's probably your
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.180]   best solution.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:15.100]   And it will allow you to put into practice your, allow you to use the resources that
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.100]   you have, the labor of your children.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.500]   It'll allow you to do it in a way that won't be harmful to other components of your life
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.020]   because you can be at home, you can be working on the farm.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.660]   That'll be really, really valuable.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:32.340]   And it can be highly profitable as a source of extra income, but also highly profitable
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.020]   as a way to develop skills.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.220]   So I'm going to riff on, are you familiar with Joel Salatin's pastured poultry systems?
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.820]   So let's riff on pastured poultry.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.940]   Pastured poultry, and for the uninitiated, is basically the idea of bringing in and raising
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.300]   very high quality pastured meat chickens on your property.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:59.620]   And the benefits of pastured poultry is it's very, it can sell in a local area.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.460]   It can sell for a very high price.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.240]   You get maybe 15 to $20 for a dressed out chicken instead of three or $4 for a conventional
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.620]   Tyson chicken at the supermarket.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:17.380]   It can be done very quickly because the type of bird that is used for this, I'm blanking
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.580]   on the name, the fat ones, the big fat ones.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.580]   - Cornish cross.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   - There we go, Cornish cross, yeah.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.500]   And basically all they do is they sit around and eat.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.060]   And so what you do is you take them out and you put them on pasture.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.700]   You build a very simple infrastructure.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   You don't need a barn.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:38.340]   You don't need anything except some very simple cages that get moved across the pasture.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.760]   And they eat grass and then supplemental feed.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.140]   They get pretty fat pretty quick.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.640]   I don't remember, three months or so, 12 weeks-ish.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.260]   And then you butcher them and sell them.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.700]   So in and of itself, you have a micro business.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.220]   And all you need for that is a place to put the birds.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.740]   You don't actually have to own land.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.380]   You can just borrow land, rent land, use whatever land you can get your hands across.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.340]   But you do need some land to put them on a pasture.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.940]   But in that business, if you start that, what you actually have is in microcosm the need
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.580]   to develop all of the basic functions of business.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:16.140]   So the constraint in a pasture poultry operation is not with the ability to raise chickens.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.140]   It's pretty simple.
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.220]   You put some chicken wire and you build some cages and you drag them across the pasture
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.220]   every day.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.900]   The constraint is in the ability to develop a market.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   So then you have to figure out, well, who wants my stuff and how do I reach those people
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.900]   with my advertising message?
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.480]   And how do I reach out to those people?
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.340]   So now you move into the world of learning something like social media marketing or internet
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.340]   marketing.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.060]   How do you get discovered as the high quality meat producer in your area?
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.020]   How do you get people to be interested in what you're doing so that they search you
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.180]   out and follow you so they're willing to come out to your farm on butchering day and pay
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.540]   you $15 or $20 per bird?
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:57.340]   And so something like that in and of itself starts to put you in the situation where you're
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.980]   developing those basic skills.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980]   Value creation.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.380]   You're discovering what people need or want or could be encouraged to want.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.440]   We're going with a concept, pastured poultry.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.820]   Some people want it, but the number of people who currently want it versus the number of
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.460]   people who could want it is very small.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.860]   So you learn how to articulate the benefits of buying pastured chickens for $20 a chicken
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.300]   instead of Tyson chicken for $3 a chicken.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   And then you create it.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.460]   So there's a basic skill of running the actual business.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.460]   Then the marketing.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.460]   How do you build demand?
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.980]   And where those types of businesses fall down is where they don't build enough demand for
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.980]   their product.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.420]   And so they can't get beyond making $100 a week of profit to making $1,000 a week of
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.260]   profit because they can't build demand.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.140]   So as you figure out how do I build demand, how do I bring in more customers, how do I
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.340]   convert those interested customers through sales, turn those prospective customers into
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.980]   paying customers by completing a transaction?
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.980]   Then value delivery.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.940]   How do I make sure that they're satisfied?
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.700]   Then you look at on the back end as you're studying the finance, managing the books,
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.180]   handling all the details there.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.060]   Then you look on the back end and you learn about back end value creation.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.660]   So once somebody comes out to buy the $20 chicken, how do I make sure that instead of
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.420]   just them bringing $20 out, that when they leave they've actually put $60 in my pocket?
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.140]   And you learn the back end creation.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.260]   And so you can learn those business skills with a tiny little business that you do with
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.140]   your children starting with pastured poultry.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.180]   And then those business skills are now transferable.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.740]   And so you start by transferring them from poultry to duck eggs or from poultry to a
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:34.060]   rabbitry or to raising some beef cattle or milk cattle or whatever you do.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060]   And you keep transitioning.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.500]   And all along the way you're practicing those business skills.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.420]   Now if you did that for a few years, you would now have the confidence from having done it
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.900]   that you could be plucked up from the middle of Indiana and plop down in the middle of
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.460]   Wisconsin and do exactly the same thing because you've done it once.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.300]   And then you could have the confidence that you could be plucked up out of a food operation
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:00.180]   and you could be put into an artisan handicrafts operation or a bee operation or anything because
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.740]   those skills are now generalized business skills that every business has.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.540]   So that would be my thought, Andy, is that since you're already on this path, just while
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:15.660]   you're doing it, study it intentionally and pay attention to how you're doing it.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.500]   And learn those lessons and you'll develop incredible resilience in your career.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:26.060]   I know you really like blogs as a way to kind of show your qualifications.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:32.500]   Do you think that would be the most, I mean, because I picture if I get laid off as a diesel
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:38.780]   technician, I want to go become a salesperson, at least at the large company I work for,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:45.060]   I have trouble walking and saying like I should, you know, qualify for this good salary job
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.340]   because I sold $5,000 a year worth of chickens.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.820]   Would a blog kind of demonstrating that, do you think there's a better way to sort of
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:57.660]   demonstrate that value for potential employers?
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.020]   Maybe that one's hard because if you're trying to prepare yourself for a career change that
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.500]   you're not actively moving into or that you're not currently working in, it's a little bit
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.780]   harder to build that kind of thing, especially to make it worth the time.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.380]   So I think everybody needs a career website that's related to themselves, their career
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.060]   and their business.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.380]   The trick is with a career website, it should be related to either what you're doing or
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.620]   what you actively want to do.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.100]   So do you actually want to transition out of your technician role to a sales role?
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.780]   I don't know if I want to transition to a sales role, but I do eventually want to transition
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.780]   out of the technician role.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.780]   Okay.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:41.180]   So the way that I would see a blog or a career website, because a blog is just one function
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:46.460]   of it, fitting into that, is you develop a website for the particular career that you
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.960]   want to pursue.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.620]   You develop it for that specific thing, and then you market your way into that career
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.900]   with that website.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.220]   But it should be done, you know, you don't have to commit to a specific time, but if
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.220]   you're going to start doing that work and laying the groundwork for it, you should have
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:08.580]   a specific goal of a specific career or a specific company that you want to work for.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.220]   And then you need to make sure that you're actually working towards it.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.980]   It might take you a year, it might take you two years to make that transition, but it
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.860]   needs to be something that you are actually pursuing, not just, "Well, maybe someday I
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.260]   might want this."
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.260]   Okay.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.260]   That makes sense.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.380]   I'm going to just, I could, of course, go on.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.740]   I have a whole section in my career and income course on a career website, and I'm actually
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.220]   redoing that one and re-releasing that as we speak.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.700]   So check that out at some point in case it solves a problem.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:45.780]   I would just say that probably you're at a phase of your life where it makes sense for
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:52.580]   you to focus on the things that are going to be connected with your children and then
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.820]   working there.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.580]   Because if I were in your situation, you probably have much more opportunity with an on-property
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:05.660]   business than you do with trying to just move into a sales job.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.700]   There's no reason why you couldn't make $50, $100, $150,000 per year with the property
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.060]   that you have bought.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.540]   There are so many ways that you could do that, that I think it makes a lot more sense for
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.820]   you to focus on that first before you start trying to transition to something else in
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.820]   the corporate world.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.820]   Good to go, Andy?
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.820]   Okay.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:28.500]   So that would be, your suggestion would be more look for resiliency in the property we
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.980]   own and having a family business to fall back on.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.980]   That's what I would do if I were in your shoes.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.260]   Because I think it'll make a better fit for your family, for the phase of life that you're
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   at.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.980]   And the great thing about sales jobs is this, sales skills are transferable, even if you
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.180]   don't have a website.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:51.820]   Because they don't usually pay sales people unless they actually produce, you can go and
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.100]   you can get sales jobs.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.780]   So I'm not worried about your ability to get a sales job.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.260]   I would focus on building the lifestyle job first, which is probably related to the big
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.980]   property that you bought.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.700]   And there should be enough profit there that you could learn the lessons and then apply
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.040]   those elsewhere.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.220]   We move to Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.100]   David, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.100]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.580]   Hi there.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:22.180]   So I'd like to ask about, I've had a change in status this year, recently married.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.420]   And because of that, we've been making some rough contributions on our own individually.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:34.100]   But I think combined, our income is going to exceed the IRS limitation.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:41.220]   So I guess part of my question is, my initial thought was to do a backdoor Roth, kind of
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.220]   recategorize it into a traditional IRA, I believe, and then move it back over into a
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.140]   Roth.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:53.180]   But I thought I'd ask, so one, I'd like to ask either, is that the best option or should
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.700]   I look into something else?
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:00.260]   And then B, if it's the best option, is it just mechanically that, just having a traditional
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.340]   IRA and moving it into there and then moving it back over into the Roth, kind of get some
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.980]   of the details ironed out in my head about actually how to execute that?
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.540]   Or should I just see a CPA or something?
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.400]   You don't necessarily need a CPA.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.860]   How much is your annual income for this year?
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.860]   I don't exactly know where I'm tracking that.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:25.660]   It's probably close to right about a hundred thousand.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.740]   And your wife's annual income for this year?
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:41.100]   She's going to be tracking around $130,000.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.140]   So the first thing that you would look at is, if this would be your first year married,
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:51.100]   you always have the choice to file married filing jointly or married filing separately.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:58.500]   Now married filing separately destroys your ability to contribute to a Roth.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.740]   If you, I just think this is kind of a technical question, not sure if I can do it off the
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.180]   top of my head.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.180]   Let's keep it simple.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:13.880]   So you can always contribute to an IRA, you just may or may not be able to contribute
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.380]   to a Roth.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.500]   And should you do the backdoor?
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.740]   Should you not?
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.900]   I'm flat footed because I don't know.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.860]   That is a question for a CPA.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.460]   My guess, what I don't, what I wonder if, is there, is there some, when did you get
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.460]   married?
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.460]   What date?
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.460]   In October.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.460]   October.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.460]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.460]   I don't know.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.700]   You stumped me.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.660]   I'm wondering if there's some way to change status in the year.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.780]   And my answer is I don't think there is.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.940]   My brain is going down married filing jointly.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:55.280]   And because if you're married filing jointly, income is, the range is less than $193,000.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.840]   You contribute over $203,000.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.100]   You can't contribute.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.180]   But with $230,000, you're over that.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.380]   Married filing separately, you can't contribute anything if you make more than $10,000.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.020]   So that doesn't work.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.620]   Singled, if you did not live with your spouse at any time of the year, you stumped me.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.420]   So I get, my best guess is I would talk with a CPA and see, or you're an accountant, and
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.740]   that would be a good, good, a good question for a tax specialist.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.460]   But my guess to your answer is you can't do a Roth IRA.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.740]   So could you do a backdoor, a backdoor Roth?
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.900]   Yeah, you could do a backdoor Roth, where you just simply contribute to a non-deductible
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.100]   IRA and then convert it to a Roth IRA.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.100]   Is that worth your time and worth the hassle with $230,000 of income?
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.980]   You be the one who decides on that, depending on the opportunities you have with your money.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:51.180]   But I think that based upon your income, you're not going to be able to, because you're probably
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.860]   gonna be married filing jointly, you're not going to be able to contribute.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.300]   The only thing I, what I don't know, since I'm not a tax preparer, I don't know if there's
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.700]   some way that you could do like a partial year return or something like that.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.700]   I don't think there is.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.580]   I've never heard of that, but I wonder if there's some bit of data that I don't have.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.580]   But it's a good question.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.580]   You stumped me.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.580]   Okay.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.580]   Thanks.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:20.260]   Yeah, I'll definitely reach out, maybe find someone that I can trust and see about what
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.940]   the best steps are.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.380]   It's a simple question for a tax preparer.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.140]   Right, right.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.300]   It should be pretty straightforward.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.220]   I just don't want to run into any crazy, hairy stuff when I start preparing taxes.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.820]   So I want to get it done.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.260]   Well, thanks for that.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:44.900]   And then I know I've heard you talk a little bit about this stuff in the past.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:52.740]   In addition to getting married, decided to buy a house and sort of thinking long-term.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.980]   Remind me again, some of your thoughts.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.180]   I mean, I'm not going to, I think either way I've decided I don't want to use extra cash
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.500]   to just put in the home equity.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:11.420]   But I have considered the idea of just slimming some of my maybe contributions to 401k, maybe
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:17.860]   IRA a little bit, maybe not completely eliminating it, but try to save up aggressively as possible
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:23.780]   to have a big lump sum to pay off the house as soon as possible to free up some options
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.660]   later on in the future.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:33.220]   Whether it be one of us stay home with kids or however that maybe works out for us.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.220]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   I don't necessarily think that like mathematically might not be the most wise thing, but I think
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.780]   it has a lot of advantages.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.260]   And so I'd like to get your opinion on that.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.220]   How old are you and how old is your wife?
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.300]   I'm in about 37.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.540]   She's in her younger 30s, 32.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.660]   So you guys are, you're giving me all kinds of difficult things today.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.860]   You guys are in that kind of like middle phase of maturity perspective.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.100]   You're older, she's younger.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.260]   You're kind of in that middle phase.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.580]   Have either of you been homeowners previously?
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.580]   No.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.580]   Okay.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:18.740]   So just Joshua's quick list for buying a house, things that I think are wise to do first.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.140]   I don't think you should buy houses with people you're not married to.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.700]   When you are married, I think you should consider buying houses, but you should move slow.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.980]   I think that there are a couple of reasons for it.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:38.060]   Number one, when someone is newly married, I think your focus should be on enjoying your
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.260]   first year or years of marriage.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.540]   Now this is a little bit strange in our culture where a lot of people get married, but nothing
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.780]   has changed because they lived together for many years prior to marriage.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:56.600]   And so in that situation, the marriage ceremony, it doesn't really, it's kind of a legal formality.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.900]   But when my wife and I married, we had both lived separately.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.780]   And so when you first come together with somebody and you start taking up residence together,
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:10.140]   you start living together, you start being together constantly, it's a time of tremendous
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.140]   opportunity.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.820]   It's really fun when you go from being separate to being together all the time, but it's also
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.140]   can be a time of challenge.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:23.220]   And I've always liked the principle in the Mosaic Law in the Old Testament in the Bible,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.140]   there was a law that when a man was newly married, he wasn't allowed to be sent away
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.380]   to war for the first year of his marriage, but he was to stay at home and learn how to
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.380]   please his wife.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.900]   And I love that principle.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.520]   And my wife and I did a lot of that.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.660]   Looking back, I wish we had spent more time.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.140]   So I don't, you know, my first year of marriage, I don't want to be starting a business.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   I don't want to be moving.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.580]   I don't want to, I just want to be enjoying together.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.460]   We treasure the time that we spent in those, in that first year of marriage.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.640]   I'm really grateful for what we did.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.900]   If I were to do it over again, I would spend even more time just with my wife.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.060]   I wouldn't be working all the time.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.340]   I wouldn't be dealing with all that hassle.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.600]   Do the minimum and enjoy that flourishing of relationship.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.540]   So that's the first thing.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.580]   Another practical reason is it takes time to learn how to communicate with one another
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.520]   with regard to goals.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.640]   And it takes time to try different things to see what you like and what you want.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.840]   Now when people are older and or when people have owned houses before, they have a, generally
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.120]   have a tendency to have a greater understanding of what they like and what they don't like
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.280]   in houses.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.420]   But houses, the way that most people buy and sell them are very expensive things to buy
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.420]   and sell.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.440]   They're very illiquid.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.700]   There's tremendous costs to get in, tremendous costs to get out.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:42.520]   And because of all that friction, you want to minimize that as much as possible.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.680]   And if it's an investment, it's a great investment, that's one thing.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.200]   But if it's just a place to live, you want to live there as seamlessly as possible and
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.760]   as frugally as possible.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.400]   So for most people, it makes sense just to buy a few houses and to try to take a lot
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.220]   of time buying the right houses so you're not constantly moving and changing and dealing
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.000]   with all the costs and the friction of those transactions.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.640]   Well it takes time to learn what you want.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.560]   Your wife, when she's getting, when she's first setting up her first house by herself
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.440]   as a married woman, does she want a one level house or a two level house?
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.200]   Or what kind of view does she want out of the front window?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.880]   Or do you want to be in the suburbs or in the middle of the city?
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.800]   And those things are hard to figure out.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   It takes time and you probably don't even get it right the first time.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   You learn.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:34.520]   I remember when we bought our first house, how I had thought excruciatingly, in a detailed,
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.360]   excruciatingly detailed way about everything that I thought we wanted.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.640]   And I thought we bought the perfect house because Joshua is the king of over analysis
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.120]   and I thought we bought the perfect house.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.520]   Well, turns out we didn't buy the perfect house and today, redoing that situation, there
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.280]   were a lot of things that I would do differently.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.840]   Now we bought a better house than a lot of other people did because of that analysis,
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.560]   but it takes time to do that.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.560]   So there's no rush.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.720]   There's no hurry.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.140]   You're going to buy a house that you're going to be for a long time.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.140]   So take time.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.140]   Enjoy being married.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.440]   Go look through tours of houses.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   Go look at houses.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.520]   Look at magazines.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.840]   Make your dream list of the things that you want.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.440]   Dream about your lifestyle.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   Get clear.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   Do you want to live a downtown lifestyle?
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.880]   Do you want to live out in the country?
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   All that stuff.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.080]   Make lists, et cetera.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.600]   Then when you do buy a house, you're most likely to make a good decision.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.160]   You're least likely to lose money and you can get there.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.000]   Now, with regard to financing, I love being debt free.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.600]   I love it when people can just pay cash.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:37.880]   And if you're willing to buy a less house than most people of your income bracket would
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.720]   buy, you could pay cash.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.600]   And I think that would be awesome.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.520]   With a couple coming together with a $230,000 household income, if you guys just simply
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.120]   bought a $200,000 house and paid cash, I think that would be great.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   The challenge is that most people with a $230,000 income don't buy a $200,000 house.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.160]   Most people with a $200,000 income buy a $600,000 house.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.720]   I don't know whether most people don't know what your goals are, whether you want to live
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.880]   in a fancy house, whether you want to save more money.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.600]   You guys got to work that out.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.520]   But if you can see the way to, with the money that you have saved and the income that you
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.740]   have, if you can see the way to pay cash, I say go for it.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:20.640]   Because when you own your house and you can completely, you have no mortgage, completely
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.720]   debt free, you get with that tremendous stability in life.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.880]   And it gives you tremendous options.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.720]   Because then if you want to quit your job and start a business, let's do it.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.040]   We don't have any bills.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.840]   If your wife wants to quit a job and start a business, let's do it.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   We don't have any bills.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.360]   If we're going to have eight kids and your wife wants to stay at home and be a full time
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.500]   homeschooling mom, let's do it.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.500]   We don't have any bills.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.120]   Whereas meanwhile, if you bought a $700,000 house and you got a mortgage payment of $3,800
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.680]   a month, all of a sudden those decisions are pulled from you.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.320]   So I love it when you want to pay cash for a house.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   I love it when you want to be completely debt free.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.360]   I think that's awesome.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.420]   Now if you're going to put a mortgage on a house, my question is what's the most sensible
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.640]   way to put a mortgage on the house?
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.620]   And my answer to that is from a safety perspective.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:18.820]   You are very, very safe if you have a mortgage balance of $0.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.660]   Because you have no monthly payment required.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.760]   You just have to make your taxes and your insurance.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.200]   But beyond that, you have no monthly payment required.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.440]   So thus you have great safety of having a debt free house.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:36.120]   But what if you buy a $300,000 house and you put down $100,000 and you have a $200,000
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   mortgage?
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   Do you have a lot of safety?
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.760]   Well, my answer is no.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.680]   And in fact, you actually have a lot of risk.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.360]   Now incidentally, that was what I did when I bought my first house.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.640]   And I came to regret it because I was stuck with a lot of equity in my house that I could
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.080]   only pull out with an additional home equity line of credit, which wasn't the most efficient
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.520]   way to borrow money out, nor did I really want to take out a home equity line of credit.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.280]   But I had to make a mortgage payment every month.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.760]   So I didn't have any safety.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   And what I came to the conclusion was, if I weren't going to pay cash for a house, I
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.080]   was going to put a mortgage on it, that the next time I bought a house, if I were buying
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:17.360]   a house with a $300,000 purchase price, I would put as close to a $300,000 mortgage
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.680]   on that property as I could get with a good interest rate.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.920]   And I would keep all the rest of the money in a separate bank account.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   Because if I had $100,000 to put down, and instead of putting it all down and being left
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:34.720]   with no money, I just put down $30,000 and I had $70,000 set aside.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.280]   If my monthly mortgage payment were $1,500 per month, but I had $70,000 set aside, then
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.440]   in that situation, I had, what, almost five years of payments, right?
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:56.320]   I think $70,000, $1,500 is 46 months divided by 12, sorry, almost four years of payments.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.080]   Now I'm very safe because now if I lose my job, or now if I want to start a business,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.440]   I've got four years of mortgage payments in the bank.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.720]   Nobody's going to come and take my house away from me.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.600]   Whereas if I had all that money in equity, the only way I'd be able to get it out would
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.520]   be to refinance the house, new costs, et cetera.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.800]   So that was basically the conclusion I came to.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:21.000]   When I buy a house, either I pay cash, which is awesome, or I finance as much as possible
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.400]   and keep the money set aside for safety until I can get within striking range of paying
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.560]   cash or paying it off, in which case I'm going to pay the thing off.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:36.680]   And with mortgage prices, the cheapest mortgage, the cheapest debt rates you ever get are on
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.000]   a primary mortgage on your house that you live in.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.400]   And so when you're looking at all the different things you're going to finance, if you're
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.920]   going to buy rental properties, if you're going to do any kind of financing, use any
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.880]   kind of debt, it makes a lot of sense to maximize the debt that's on your house and minimize
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.440]   debt that's in other places.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.520]   In addition, you get the strongest debtor laws that are going to apply to your personal
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   house.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.720]   If you wind up in a disaster, much rather have the mortgage on my personal house and
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.960]   be able to take advantage of the debtor laws there versus having the debt on something
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   else.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.800]   So those are basically my arguments.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.560]   I would love it if you paid cash for a house.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.880]   I think that's great.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   Just don't make the mistake of thinking that by putting 50% down, you're safer.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.880]   You're not.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:24.920]   You're safer to put 10% down, keep the other 40% in cash, and then wait until you can pay
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.240]   it off 100%, then make the payments and pay it off 100%.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.880]   Okay, thank you.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   My pleasure.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   Hope that made sense.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.500]   Joshua's speech on home ownership.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.360]   We go now to Portland, Oregon.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   How can I serve you today?
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   Oh, hi.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.560]   Am I on?
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.560]   You're on.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.560]   Tell me your name and let's go.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.560]   Oh, hi.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.560]   Oh, hi, Joshua.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.880]   This is Chris from Portland.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.200]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.520]   My question is pertaining to my 401(k) that I'm participating with my employer.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.360]   And basically I'm rather concerned about the economy.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.660]   And so I thought I was going to be clever and try to take some money off the table.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:13.520]   My plan was to try to put all my funds in a money market account while it's still within
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.260]   the 401(k).
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.840]   And I just realized that their only option or their equivalent to a money market account
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:29.020]   was a, I'm guessing it's a Wells Fargo stable fund fee.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.680]   And it seems like it's considered a bond investment.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:37.000]   And I'm wondering if I pretty much have sabotaged myself.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.360]   Is it in treasury bonds, corporate bonds?
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.680]   What kind of bond portfolio?
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:50.640]   It seems like it's a mix, but it's definitely under the category of a bond investment.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:58.360]   And honestly, even when I've talked to representatives of this financial institution, even the representatives
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:04.000]   didn't have a very clear idea as to what exactly is all in that fund, which made me really
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   nervous.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.480]   I was going to say, doesn't that make you feel good?
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:13.920]   And so I'm wondering if I was better off just kind of just being in the market versus now
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:20.760]   being stuck in the bond, which bond investment, which I think might even be a lot more riskier
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.900]   than the normal equities.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.640]   Did you read the prospectus for the fund?
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.600]   I did not.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.680]   It was one of those where I felt that if I had something equivalent to a money market,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.440]   I thought that was going to be safer.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.040]   And so now I'm trying to do more research and trust you, I might have to backtrack.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   Right.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.560]   So short answer is the first thing you do is read the prospectus.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.880]   Believe it or not, all the mutual fund companies actually had to put all kinds of detail to
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.520]   information in the prospectus and they're actually quite illuminating.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:04.680]   They put many people to sleep, but if you want an answer, you go to the prospectus.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   If I'm answering this question specifically to the specific fund, all I do is I go to
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:13.120]   the prospectus and I read the prospectus and I say, and you just read the summary, the
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.920]   first few pages and you probably have your answer, but read the prospectus, see what
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.720]   it says and that will answer your question.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:28.000]   Now if this is the fund that your 401k administrator is offering to you, which is supposed to provide
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.360]   for you the ability to have safe money, if this is what they're saying is the safe money,
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.480]   then it is probably not a long-term corporate bond fund.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:47.680]   It's probably a short-term treasury bill fund of some kind and it's probably designed for
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   the stability of money.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.320]   Now the prospectus is going to tell you, but let's talk through what some of these words
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.120]   mean and how they would be affected by volatility.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:02.720]   So if I'm understanding your line of thought, you are concerned about potential volatility
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.600]   in the broader stock market, ups and downs, and you want to protect the money that you've
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.080]   saved in your 401k from the potential downs from that volatility.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.240]   And so you're trying to find a more stable place to park the cash.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.440]   If you could park the money in cash, you would be happy, but now you've got a fund.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.880]   So you say, well, it's bonds.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.560]   And you know that bonds, just because something is made a bond, doesn't mean that there's
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.140]   not volatility.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:34.920]   And because you're concerned about volatility, you understand that bond prices are influenced
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.200]   by interest rates in an inverse way.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:45.840]   So if interest rates were to fall on a bond fund, then the value of the bonds would increase.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.520]   Whereas if interest rates were to rise, then the value of your current bond portfolio would
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.840]   decrease.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:59.360]   And you know that in a bond mutual fund, this effect is especially pronounced because the
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.600]   duration of a bond mutual fund never reaches zero.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   So bond mutual funds experience significant volatility when interest rates go up and interest
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600]   rates go down.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.680]   In addition, then, I don't mean this to sound patronizing, I'm just trying to tell the story
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.640]   so that other listeners can follow through.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.120]   So forgive me, this is not meant to sound patronizing.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:26.240]   But you know that in a bond mutual fund, your duration never reaches zero.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   And so you're infinitely exposed to the ups and downs of the value of the bond based upon
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.720]   the interest rate environment.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.520]   Additionally, you're looking around at interest rates and you're saying, in the span of history
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.560]   of recorded interest rates, all things considered, we're in a fairly low interest rate environment.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.840]   And we've been in a low interest rate environment for a long time.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.880]   And because of that, you're concerned that interest rates could rise, they could rise
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.880]   substantially.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:56.560]   And if interest rates were to rise and rise substantially, that could lead to a major
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.920]   decrease in the value of your bond portfolio.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.980]   So here are the factors that you need to identify.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:09.120]   The first thing you need to identify is what kind of bonds are present in your portfolio.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.280]   Is it government debt?
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.840]   Is it treasuries?
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.080]   Or is it corporate debt?
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.320]   Is it municipal debt, et cetera?
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.000]   Because the word bond doesn't give us enough information.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.080]   So you want to read about that.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:25.160]   And my guess would be that if this is what you were steered to, there's probably government
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.900]   debt in it, possibly just treasuries.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:33.400]   The second thing that you need to read the prospectus and find out is the technical word
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   is duration.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.440]   What's the duration of the portfolio?
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   There will be a calculation.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:46.200]   If you just do a web search for the ticker symbol for this portfolio, you'll be able
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.000]   to find the duration listed.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.960]   Morningstar or something will list the duration calculation of the bond portfolio.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.200]   And duration is simply a measurement of when do these bonds come due.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.080]   And that'll tell you if this is a short-term bond fund or a long-term bond fund.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.320]   The prospectus itself will also tell you are we investing in short-term bonds or longer-term
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   bonds.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.620]   And the difference here is, let's use the perspective of government debt.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.740]   If you said, Joshua, I've got a million dollars and I want to just put this million dollars
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.920]   aside and have it be absolutely stable, if you put that in T-bills, which are 30-day
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:22.240]   treasuries, you've got no risk whatsoever.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.040]   Your portfolio values are going to be totally stable.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:30.260]   But if you put it into 30-year treasuries, you've got major problems because the value
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:35.000]   of those treasuries are going to go massively up and down based upon interest rates.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.080]   So my guess is you probably don't have anything to worry about because I think your portfolio
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.800]   is probably made up of short-term government treasuries.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.040]   And in that situation, it'll probably be fairly stable.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.840]   It won't be subject to significant amounts of interest rate risk.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.720]   And that's probably the safest option that they've got that'll give you stability in
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.880]   your 401(k) because every 401(k) administrator is going to have some kind of stable value
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   fund.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.640]   So if this is what you were pointed to, I think that's the story that you're going to
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.000]   find when you read the prospectus.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.440]   But don't take my word for it.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.000]   Read the prospectus and get your own answer.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   >>Joshua: Great.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Excellent.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   No, that's super helpful.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Thank you.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.640]   That makes me feel a little bit less stressier thinking I might have sabotaged myself there.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.600]   >>Steve: No, you didn't sabotage yourself.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.400]   Just, I mean, read the prospectus and find out.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.760]   But that's where your answers are.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.360]   And what you're looking for is you're looking for short-term on the portfolio duration.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:34.560]   And you're looking for high-quality government debt, which is as close to bulletproof, as
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.480]   close to risk-free as we have the ability to achieve.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.880]   Now, another day we can talk about whether it's actually risk-free, but that's not for
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   today.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   >>Joshua: I gotcha.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.880]   Do you have time for one more question?
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.880]   >>Steve: Go ahead.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.880]   We'll do it quickly.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   >>Joshua: Oh, yes.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:57.440]   So, I was considering taking, cashing out my Roth 401, I'm sorry, my Roth IRA just to
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:03.320]   have some, I guess, dry powder on the side.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.200]   Just in general, I was wondering what your thoughts on that.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.560]   Because currently my cash flow is pretty low.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:20.760]   So, I was thinking if I cash out the Roth IRA, I may have more resources for later if
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.600]   there is a turn in the economy.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   >>Steve: Right.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.680]   So, when you use the term cash out your Roth IRA, do you mean you want to sell the stocks
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   and move them to a cash account and leave them in the Roth IRA?
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.120]   Or do you mean you want to sell the stocks, take the money out of the Roth IRA and put
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.480]   it into your personal checking account?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.160]   >>Joshua: Yeah, I'd take it into my personal account.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   >>Steve: Yeah.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:48.640]   So, I don't see any reason why you would ever do that if you didn't absolutely have to.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.320]   It's very hard to imagine why you would ever do that.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.520]   If you're worried about volatility in your investments, sure, it's your money.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:01.840]   Move it to a stable cash equivalent, a savings account, whatever you can find with your custodian.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.120]   But there's no benefit of moving the money to your personal checking account.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.040]   And in fact, I would say there are major disadvantages.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.640]   For example, one of my big pet peeves is when people do this, they often take the money
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:19.080]   out of an account that's protected by bankruptcy laws and move it into an account that's not
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.960]   protected by bankruptcy laws.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.320]   And if you're worried about problems in the economy, the very first thing you do is you
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.520]   do bankruptcy planning.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.440]   That's always what you do, is you sit down and say, "What if I got forced into bankruptcy?"
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.920]   And I use that because most people who go bankrupt don't intend to be there.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   And there is this thing where in theory you can be, very rarely, but you can be forced
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.680]   into bankruptcy by a creditor.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.960]   So I think that's a good place to start.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.800]   You say, "Let's pretend that I was forced into involuntary bankruptcy.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.960]   What would happen with my money?"
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.760]   Well, if you've got $30,000 in your Roth IRA, read the laws of your state.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.560]   I don't know what Oregon bankruptcy laws are, so let me just give you Florida laws because
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.280]   I know Florida laws.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.520]   If I have $30,000 in my Roth IRA in Florida, and then I get forced into bankruptcy because
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:06.800]   I lose my job, I get cancer, I wind up with $15 million of debt, and my creditors force
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:14.400]   me into bankruptcy, if that $30,000 were still in my Roth IRA, then at least on the other
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.520]   side of my bankruptcy proceedings, I would have that $30,000 available to build from,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.120]   and all the rest of my debts would be discharged, and my creditors would get nothing, and I
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.240]   would have my $30,000 to start again with.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.400]   But if I had taken that $30,000 and put it in my checking account, then that $30,000
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.280]   would all go to pay my $15 million debt to my creditors.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.960]   I would go through bankruptcy court, my debts would be discharged, but now I got nothing
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.440]   to rebuild from.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:44.280]   So I get very, very nervous about moving money out of 401(k)s, which are even better than
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.680]   Roth IRAs from a bankruptcy perspective, or moving them out of Roth IRAs.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   I don't want that to happen unless it's intentional, and there's a very, very strong argument,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.720]   just from a bankruptcy and a creditor protection perspective.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.680]   So absolutely not.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:04.120]   I also get very nervous about spending investments because you're worried about turmoil, because
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:08.880]   most of the time, if you will just simply go and work more, or build a higher income,
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.660]   you can survive economic crises pretty well.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:19.040]   No matter the crisis, almost any crisis can be solved by earning more money, by making
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   money.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.600]   So better for you, leave the money alone, and go and get well-employed, stay well-employed,
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.840]   have redundancy, resiliency in your income, build a side business, have a career plan,
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.960]   know what you would build if you did get fired, do all the stuff I've talked about extensively
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.320]   to prepare to keep your career, because as long as you can keep your income, you can
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.600]   weather almost any financial crisis well.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.520]   It's only if you lose your income that things fall apart.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.320]   And now, if you lose your income, that's where we go back to bankruptcy protection.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.900]   I still want the money stashed aside in an account until a time that I decide I want
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.680]   to take it out and expose it to the potential claims of creditors.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   Make sense?
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   That was fantastic.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.680]   Thank you for your sound advice.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.680]   My pleasure.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   Good questions.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.960]   All right, two more callers on the line.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.120]   We move to Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.920]   Tell me your name and how I can serve you today, please.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.400]   Hi, Josh.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.200]   This is Walter.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.160]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.160]   Walter sounds good.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.160]   Go with your question, please.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   Okay.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.360]   And this might be something that is really brief.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:29.160]   I'm interested in hearing a little bit more of your perspective on investing locally.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:37.160]   I know in previous episodes, you talked about, of course, being involved in personal finance,
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.560]   joining the industry, leaving the industry.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:45.560]   And then I think at one point, maybe you had mentioned maybe pulling your investments out
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   of the stock market.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   Right.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.120]   And so I'm interested in hearing a little bit more about your perspective on that.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.040]   And then this might be something best covered in a future episode that whatever you could
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.280]   provide today would be great.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:03.560]   I'll give you just a couple of big ideas to consider because this is a process that I'm
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.040]   still working through.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   And I've thought about it conceptually.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:16.440]   I'm working on learning by experience everything that I can, but I still don't want to teach
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.840]   from it comprehensively.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.960]   So at some point I'll do standalone episodes on it, I'm sure, but here I'll just give you
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:22.960]   the big picture.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   So you're right.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:33.040]   At the moment, I don't currently own any publicly traded stocks.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:40.360]   And I'm not particularly, although I don't own any mutual funds, and I'm not opposed
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.040]   to some.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.880]   So there are certain mutual fund companies that I could buy ethical funds from that I
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.240]   could feel good about.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.920]   There are some stocks that I could choose that I could feel good about.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:59.280]   I really have a deep frustration, especially with the American stock market, I have a deep
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:07.480]   frustration with the intense corruption with the crony capitalism that the vast majority
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:11.280]   of the large publicly traded companies are engaged in.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.760]   And I don't have the interest in going and digging through small cap stocks to try to
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.680]   figure out where my play is there.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.240]   That's not my interest.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:27.760]   One of my biggest annoyances, one of the biggest values of stocks, publicly traded stocks especially,
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.360]   is you get access to professional management.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.200]   You get very low involvement investments.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:39.800]   You get very, you know, the only true passive income that I think is actually truly passive
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.880]   is if you can live on the dividends from publicly traded companies.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.200]   I think that's actually passive income.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.600]   I don't think there's much passive income that's truly passive other than dividends
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.100]   from publicly traded companies.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:56.320]   But if you've got $10 million and you can sit back and you can just simply live on the
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:01.840]   dividends from those investments, then you truly can sit back and just enjoy that passive
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.840]   income.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.520]   The problem is at this stage of my life, I don't need passive income.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.200]   I want active income.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.240]   And because of that passive nature and because of the intense scrutiny that those markets
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.120]   get, I think that's probably some of the lowest returning investment possibilities.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:22.240]   And so at my stage of wealth, I believe there are much bigger options and opportunities
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.800]   available to me.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.240]   And I have experienced that, found that, etc.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.060]   There are much bigger options that are just so much more profitable.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.920]   When you're dealing with smaller amounts of wealth, it's very feasible for you to
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.560]   double your capital on a single deal.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:43.520]   I was talking about a deal with a friend of mine, an export-import deal.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.160]   And he'd run the numbers.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:51.320]   He was thinking about this deal where if he bought in the United States a container load
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:57.280]   of something and then shipped it to a foreign country, that he could sell it for triple
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.360]   what he would buy it for in the United States.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.880]   That was his investment idea.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.400]   Now I don't know if it's true or not, but those kinds of deals are frequently available
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.600]   when you can do an export-import deal, or you can buy and sell something, you can flip
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   something.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.240]   You know, with my children, I'll teach them, way back in the archives, I interviewed a
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:21.600]   guy, I forget the name now, it was a great blog, just blanking on it right now.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.480]   But his deal was he built a business, he was deep in debt, he was a contractor, and he
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.920]   was deep in debt, and he got himself out of debt and accomplished financial independence
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.080]   by buying and selling stuff on Craigslist.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:40.600]   And it wound up being buying, primarily, buying old appliances, washers and dryers, fixing
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.120]   them up, painting them, fixing the motors, and then reselling them on Craigslist.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.040]   And the profit margin in a business like that is absolutely massive.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:52.960]   The challenge is it's hard to invest a million dollars into that, whereas $10,000, you can
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:58.000]   easily put $10,000 to work in a Craigslist flipping operation, buying stuff cheap on
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.560]   Facebook Marketplace and then marketing it again.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:07.520]   So the profit potential, at least with smaller amounts of money, is so much higher.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   And that profit potential, especially in the early phases of wealth building, is really,
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.800]   really important.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:20.320]   What annoys me about the stock market, and the way that investment advice is often given,
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.440]   is people talk about the time value of money, right?
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.600]   And I think you should, right?
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.840]   We need to teach our kids about the time value of money, starting at 15 years old.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.720]   And look, what if you put your money in a Roth IRA, starting at 15 years old, and you
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.360]   leave it alone for 65 years?
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   And you can do the classic chart.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.880]   Look, you put $2,000 in for 10 years, and then you don't put any more money in, and
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.320]   you have way more money down the road.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:45.200]   And look, the stocks are great, and the market is great, and you get 7% interest, et cetera.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   That's powerful.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.480]   It's really good.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:55.960]   But what's always the case is the person who's teaching that doesn't present the full range
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.640]   of alternatives.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.200]   And what that's usually compared to is, well, you could put $2,000 in your Roth IRA, or
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   you could spend the money.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.440]   So we're trying to get you to not spend the money.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   We're trying to get you to save it.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.720]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:13.560]   But what if you took the $2,000, and you taught that same 15-year-old, instead of going and
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.760]   putting it in a Roth IRA, what if you teach them to go and buy a car that's wrecked at
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:25.320]   -- they buy the auction, that something's wrong with it, and they pay $2,000 for it.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:30.280]   They invest 30 hours of work fixing the things that are working, and they flip it for $5,000.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.480]   And what if you teach them how to do that four times per year, starting with the same
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.000]   $2,000 of starting capital?
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.460]   And now they've turned their $2,000 into $20,000 by the end of the year.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:44.080]   And what if you teach them the next year how to take that $20,000 and to buy three broken
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.880]   down boats that they got from the side of the road, spruce them up, fix them up, modernize
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.520]   them, and flip them on Craigslist?
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.480]   And then what if the next year you taught them how to go and open a local car sales
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.020]   lot, and here they are at -- I forget my age -- 18 years old, and they've been able to
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:07.240]   accumulate $40,000, and they go and they turn that $40,000 into inventory of 10 or 15 inexpensive
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.360]   cars that they then flip for, and they double.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.880]   It's very reasonable in a used car business to double your sales price.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:24.920]   So now, instead of dealing with a 7% market return, we are dealing with tremendously higher.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:31.420]   And so where I feel gypped is when I was a kid, people told me about -- I read the books
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.880]   about investing in the stock market -- but I didn't have somebody come along and teach
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.600]   me how to put my money into flipping and flipping stuff.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.840]   And I was wrong.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.240]   I wish I had flipped cars.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.580]   I wish I had flipped websites.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.080]   I wish I had flipped houses.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.240]   And because the profit margins are so much higher.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.880]   Because now, instead of an efficient market out there where you've got 58 bazillion mutual
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.520]   fund analysts who've got it done, I've got a very inefficient market.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:04.420]   I'm going to buy this Ford Fusion and repaint this thing or swap out this body panel.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.740]   You get the point.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:12.120]   So investing in the local market, especially with smaller amounts of money, has the potential
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.880]   to be much more profitable than investing in the big public and trade of stock market
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.920]   because of the additional work or expertise required, the specialized inside knowledge.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.780]   Now let's add on to that tax efficiency.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.640]   When you're dealing in your local market, you're much more likely to be doing business
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:37.020]   in doing your work as an investor in the context of a business structure, which just dramatically
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.440]   transforms your tax efficiency.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:46.080]   Where instead of dealing with the capital gains market and very modest ability to deduct
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.040]   expenses associated with your investment activities, you're now dealing in the business market,
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.880]   which has just a totally different tax code, many, many more options available in it.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.820]   And now add on number three, add on the ability to work in the local community.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:08.420]   And one of the biggest constraints that I am under, due to my worldview, Jesus said,
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:13.240]   do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt and where
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.360]   thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.740]   and rust do not corrupt and where thieves cannot break in and steal.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.740]   For where your treasure is there, your heart will be also.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.140]   And I've pondered that verse for decades and I think about how do you lay up for yourselves
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.140]   treasures in heaven?
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:33.180]   Well, if you think about it, the only thing that exists in heaven are souls.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.180]   That's it.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.180]   People.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:40.060]   You know, there's no rust because there's no physical objects in heaven.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.840]   But rather are dealing with the immaterial eternal souls of people.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.240]   So if I'm going to invest and lay up for myself treasures in heaven, the only way I know how
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.560]   to actually do that is to invest into the souls of people.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   Now that can of course have all kinds of application, but one of the biggest opportunities I see
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:06.160]   with investments is the ability to invest into people.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.300]   And those of us who are skilled, those of us who are knowledgeable, those of us who
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:15.720]   are intelligent, those of us who are thoughtful, those of us who've been blessed with the character,
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:22.480]   the self-discipline, the intelligence, just the natural cognitive ability, et cetera,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.420]   to accumulate wealth and make good investment decisions, I believe we have a responsibility
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.260]   to use that in a productive way.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.760]   And one of the things that always bothers me is if I see somebody in need and I don't
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.640]   have the ability to help them with anything except money, and so now we get into the world
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.840]   of jobs, right?
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.280]   I have friends who need work.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.900]   And so let's say that I've got a million dollars.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900]   Let's just change it.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:55.860]   Let's say I've got $10,000 and I've got $10,000 that I own in mutual funds.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.140]   I buy Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:06.680]   And now I see my neighbor boy in my neighborhood is really struggling and would like work,
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.220]   but he's being raised by a single mom, doesn't have, let's paint the story bad.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.220]   He's in a tough spot.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:16.340]   Well, if I got $10,000 of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, I'm a Roth IRA, great,
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.340]   big whoop.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:22.180]   All I can do for the kid next door is maybe give him money, but what does he need?
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.020]   He needs work and he needs a job.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:30.100]   So now let's say I take that $10,000 and I go and I buy a $3,000 pickup truck and I buy
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.900]   $7,000 worth of lawn equipment.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.940]   I buy a big commercial mower and some weed eaters, et cetera, and I print up some flyers
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.300]   and I go and start bringing on customers for that.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.300]   Well, now I go to the 16-year-old kid next door and I say, "Listen, come and work for
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.300]   me.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.300]   Let's get a job.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   Let's work on Saturdays."
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.300]   And I give him a job.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.220]   Now I have the opportunity to spend 10 hours with him on Saturday doing hard, heavy work
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.220]   and we can talk in the truck and I can step in and I can encourage him and I can love
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:02.260]   him and I can maybe be the father figure that he didn't have.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:08.580]   And every single bit of my $10,000 is a business write-off and now within that I can use our
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.860]   services and our labor and I can turn that into a bigger profit, which means that next
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.500]   weekend I can go out and I can hire two guys like that.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.020]   Then I can hire three guys like that.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.780]   Now I see the guy on the side of the street who's begging for money, doesn't have any
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.700]   money, and I can say, "Listen, buddy, come and work with us today."
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:28.700]   Or I can see the illegal Guatemalan next door who's struggling because he can't get a job
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.020]   and I can say, "Listen, buddy, come and work for me for today."
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.700]   And I can now start to invest into the souls of people.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:39.540]   Well, $10,000 of lawn equipment has the ability to turn into eternal wealth in a way that
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:44.100]   $10,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index just simply can't do.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:51.700]   So this is what I am now convinced of with regard to – this is what I'm convinced
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.820]   of.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:58.180]   And so is that there's much higher financial profit available.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.660]   I sat in a hot tub with a guy one time who was a multimillionaire off of a simple lawn
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:07.300]   business because he had business acumen.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:14.240]   And if the people – you got me going, good question, Walter – if the people who spend
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:23.440]   their time – so many people go into areas where they compete with the brightest people.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.740]   If I were to go and become a Wall Street guy, I have the most brutal of competition in the
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.740]   world.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:34.220]   The smartest, the most driven, most motivated, most self-disciplined people who are willing
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:38.660]   to work 80 hours per week are my competition there.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.900]   That's a tough business.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.140]   I could do it.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.380]   I could do it.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:48.900]   But if I take that same exact skill, knowledge, intelligence, analytical ability, and I go
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:54.700]   and I apply it to my local lawn business, I could probably just completely wipe away
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:59.180]   the competition because the average local lawn guy is a guy who just tosses a mower
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.140]   in the back of his truck.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.860]   And you see this in every single industry.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:09.940]   So simply as a competitive strategy, you get higher returns, potentially, potentially higher
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:15.100]   returns because you get less competition.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.140]   If the guy – I remember years ago when I was still a teenager, I read Stanley's book
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:24.060]   Millionaire Next Door and it convinced me that if the people who go and compete for
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:29.900]   law jobs or for doctor jobs, etc., would go and start businesses and deal in a blue-collar
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.760]   market, they could just sweep the floor with the competition.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.980]   And then now moving on to kind of the last phase, and I'll quit.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:42.820]   When I think about my children and my goals for my children, I need work for my children
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:43.820]   to do.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.540]   I need businesses that they can be involved in so that they learn the lessons of business
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:57.420]   in the same way that the 16-year-old fatherless troubled young man next door needs help.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.420]   My children need the same thing.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:06.720]   And I want to create opportunities for them to learn.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.640]   And so now when we can build up a family business, and the family business has the ability to
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.140]   make very nice profits and also to fund very nice lifestyles.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.040]   The thing that drives me nuts, you got all these people, many people – let me not be
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:26.360]   hyperbolic here – many people who their idea of getting wealthy, they want to retire,
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.360]   right?
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.480]   Going to retire.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.200]   So my goal is to build enough wealth and put it all into mutual funds so I can retire and
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.040]   travel to London.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.380]   The problem is then you're stuck with living on whatever the wealth is that your mutual
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:42.920]   funds can create, and you're living in everything in a post-tax world.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.600]   Meanwhile, why don't you just build a business that will send you to London, put you up in
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.640]   a hotel, make sure you're working while you're there – one, two, three, four, five hours
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   per day.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.280]   And if you're doing work that you're engaged with, now you have a legit business trip.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.400]   Now you can go to all the nicest things, you can move all your London things over to the
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.080]   meals and entertainment column, you can move your hotel over to the business credit card.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.180]   You can do all of that, and it all becomes executive perks.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:17.680]   Why would anybody give up a business just for the simple tax efficiency of owning a
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680]   business?
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.960]   Why would you ever give that up and go to the world where you just live on mutual funds?
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:29.240]   So I'm not trying to preach to other people about what they should do with mutual funds.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:35.080]   I just, at this point in time, seeing the financial opportunities that are on every
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.600]   hand, and then especially given my worldview with the fact that I want to buy up treasures
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:47.000]   in heaven, which means investing in people, and I don't particularly care for how the
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.120]   decisions that many of the Fortune 100 make.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.840]   I don't particularly care for some of the ways that they treat their people.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.160]   I don't particularly care for the bribery and the corruption that they're involved in.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.480]   I don't care for the markets they're in.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.120]   I don't care for their marketing.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:06.040]   So how on earth, why should I ever put money with that when the opportunity is at hand
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.840]   where I can impact my community, where I can quadruple money and make way higher returns
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.860]   than the few percentage points that the great honored mutual fund investors are willing
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.860]   to pass out?
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.760]   So you triggered me, Walter.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760]   That's where I'm at in it.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.760]   Great.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   No, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.000]   And I think there's a lot of interest in that.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.840]   So as you have time and think about it, I'd love to hear even more about this on regular
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.840]   episodes.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.480]   So just a suggestion for you.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.480]   No, thank you.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.800]   I want to speak from a place of experience when I do that.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.660]   And by the way, the thing I didn't even talk about was self-directing, self-directing your
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.660]   retirement accounts.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:51.340]   I mean, there's no reason why I can't run that business that sends me to London and
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:58.380]   then simultaneously run a self-directed 401k that I use to do real estate investment businesses.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.380]   And I got to be careful.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:04.780]   There's a bunch of rules, but I can run a self-directed 401k with a giant property portfolio
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.020]   in it.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:13.940]   And as long as I am careful to follow the rules about me being involved in the work,
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:19.400]   and I can do it all ethically, but then all of a sudden now I can contract the services
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.280]   of other companies and other people in my community that make a difference.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.580]   And that's always how communities run, right?
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.800]   The good old boys network.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.880]   It's not going away.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.000]   It's important.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.180]   And it's a major component of everything we do.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.180]   So that's what I got.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.180]   All right.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.040]   We finally go stay in the South and we go to Alabama.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   Mr. Tim, welcome to the show.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040]   Hi.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   I have a question about financial planners.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.800]   You said before that you don't know why people balk at paying 1%.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.600]   And I was curious your thoughts about that.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:04.360]   I'd always thought I was going to just put money into a total stock market index fund.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:10.320]   But my stepfather's a financial planner and says that, you know, he makes the argument
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.720]   about the behavioral economics.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.400]   And I don't know that I buy that if you're disciplined.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.740]   But I was curious if the benefit you see in that and what your thoughts are about whether
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:28.720]   you can do it yourself or if everyone needs a financial planner.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.800]   So I want to be careful.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.640]   Did I actually state that in your understanding of my words, did I actually say I don't know
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.020]   why people balk at 1%?
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.200]   Was that actually what I said or was that just like I can't imagine myself saying that.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.200]   But maybe I did.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   I talk a lot.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.600]   I thought in some episode you said that people balk at the 1% asset under management.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600]   Right.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.600]   Right.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.600]   I don't want to misremember you.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.600]   No, you do.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.600]   It's just that so I'm kind of stuck in the middle.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.680]   And over the years, my loyalty to when I first left the financial services, the professional
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:08.560]   financial services, I think I was probably still in terms of my perspective, my objectivity
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.840]   was probably a little bit clouded by the fact that I wanted to defend everything that the
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.120]   financial services industry did.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.280]   I think we all have that natural tendency.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.640]   Over the years, I don't have any ties with the financial services industry.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.360]   And I probably am more objective today than I once was.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.840]   So here's what my current opinions are on it.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:40.400]   I don't think everybody needs a financial advisor who's managing their portfolio.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.400]   I don't.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:47.840]   I think there are people who have the self-discipline and the knowledge and the skill and the expertise
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.280]   to manage their own portfolio and to do very well at it.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.080]   And they have the skill to do it.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.160]   What the percentage of people is that has that skill, I don't know.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:06.040]   But I don't think that everybody needs a financial advisor who's going to manage their portfolio.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:13.820]   In many cases, the value proposition that some financial advisors offer is very thin.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:18.120]   And in that situation, one wonders if it's really worth it.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.160]   At this point in time, financial management is basically a commodity across most mainstream
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.360]   firms.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.720]   It's built on a set of industry expectations.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.400]   And it's a fairly basic commodity.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.060]   And this is where the argument of, listen, just take all the money out of the managed
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:42.580]   mutual fund portfolio, cut your expenses by 150 basis points by moving it to an index
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:46.400]   fund at whatever custodian you want.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.000]   It's a good argument.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.020]   So in order for a financial advisor to be worth the money, they should be returning
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.020]   a lot more.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.020]   Where are the customer's yachts?
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.440]   The customer should have more yachts than the financial advisor does.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.700]   And unfortunately, that's not the reputation that the industry has.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.600]   So where can a financial advisor offer value?
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:13.360]   Well, the first place that a financial advisor might be able to offer value is in alpha,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.280]   the outperformance of one investment portfolio versus another.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.360]   And that's what all of the academic studies focus on.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.940]   And that's the hardest proposition to make.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.060]   Because alpha is not easy to achieve.
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:30.060]   And it's not easy to predict that I'm going to be able to achieve it in the future.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:36.080]   And delivering alpha doesn't really pay off in the retail financial advisor space.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.580]   In the financial advice industry, when I used to work in it professionally, I was with clients.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.780]   In the same way that I've been on this phone call for the last hour and 16 minutes, I have
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.500]   no idea what the market is doing.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.380]   And that was the same way that I was with clients.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.620]   I was talking with clients constantly.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.540]   And I had no ability to be confident about what was happening in the market.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.120]   That wasn't my scenario.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.960]   So me as an individual advisor in that scenario, I couldn't deliver alpha to a client.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.060]   There was no way in the world that I could say with a straight face, "Well, Mr. Client,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.140]   I'm going to deliver alpha to you."
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.640]   So maybe there's a way in some firm, right?
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.300]   Some firms, boutique firms, or firms that are very focused on investment management,
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.940]   they have a theory and they want to say, "We can deliver alpha."
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.940]   Is it possible?
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:19.940]   I believe alpha is possible.
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.900]   Do I know how to say to somebody, "Find it?"
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.980]   I don't.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:27.600]   So alpha is the hardest value proposition to make.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.500]   So where else can a financial advisor offer value?
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:37.460]   Well, generally the behavioral model, basically the behavioral sales pitch was what I settled
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.100]   on when I was in that business.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:43.820]   I came to the perspective and I said, "Listen, I may not be able to deliver alpha.
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.860]   I'm not promising you that I can.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:52.060]   But what I can prove to you is the majority of investors underperform their own investments
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:57.180]   by about half because of bad behavioral decisions."
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:02.340]   Earlier we had, I can't remember if it was Chris, was talking in today's call.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:10.460]   He says, "I'm moving my money out of the investment and I moved it into a cash account to protect
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.460]   it."
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:15.980]   Now, I believe that that caller, if it was Chris or whoever it was, I believe that that
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:22.180]   caller should do that if that's what he thinks that he needs to do.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.700]   The data indicates that very likely Chris is going to get that wrong and very likely
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:32.060]   Chris is going to miss out on the growth of the market and very likely Chris is going
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.380]   to, he's probably selling at the wrong time.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.420]   Now I don't think that Chris has to do that.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.780]   Chris might have studied his position.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.380]   He might have really dug into it and he might be really confident.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:43.700]   But the data would indicate that on the average, if we deal out 100 Chris's who said, "I'm
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.140]   going to do what Chris did," most of them are going to get it wrong.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.780]   So we know that the average investor, Dalbar I think is the person who used to do it, I'm
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:51.780]   not aware of it changing.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:56.580]   But the average investor underperforms their own fund by about 50%.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:59.580]   So if the average fund gets eight, the average investor gets four.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:03.140]   So there's your first kind of discussion of value proposition.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:08.540]   Mr. Prospective Client, if I can do nothing else but keep you invested, and this math
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.980]   is a little bit fuzzy but it's driving the point home.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:20.500]   If I can do nothing else but keep you invested and I can keep you in your own funds by preparing
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:24.380]   you or by through some mechanism and I can keep you invested through the good times and
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:29.980]   the bad, then at least I can keep you in those investments that are going to make you eight.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:33.620]   And then if you're charging one, you're going to get seven versus four.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:36.140]   That's kind of the first volley.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.740]   Now the investor I think could turn around and say, "Well, why do I need you to keep
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.340]   me in my investments?
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:45.340]   Can't I just buy the investments and put them in a vault and never look at them again and
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.340]   stay invested?"
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.700]   Yeah, you can.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.340]   Are most people going to do it?
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.340]   No.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.540]   How do we get to the next function?
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.620]   How can I do that?
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:20:00.580]   Well, it's not necessarily just a matter of yelling at the advisor and saying, sorry,
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.900]   yelling at the client and saying, "You've got to stay invested."
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.340]   Hopefully there's some techniques that I can build in place.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.300]   What I relied on was financial planning.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:11.460]   I believe that with the right financial plan, the right allocation of money into the right
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:15.500]   resources towards the right goals gives me the track to run on.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.980]   So now if a client is in a situation and they say, "I've got to get out of this investment.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:22.500]   The market's just collapsing," I can look at them and say, "No, listen.
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.300]   Listen, we've planned for this.
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.460]   What I've done is we've worked over here.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.960]   We've adjusted your outflow.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.540]   You don't have any debt or we've adjusted your debt payment.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:33.260]   So you don't actually have a lot of money to spend right now.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   Look over here.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.380]   We've set aside this cash.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.580]   This cash will get you through the next two years.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.580]   You're in good shape.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.580]   You don't have to sell.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.100]   Look, let's look at the market returns.
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.520]   When the market has gone down, it's often come back.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.380]   We have good reason to believe that things are going to come back.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.380]   So let's just sit tight."
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:53.740]   Now, if you go back to a time like the fall of 2008 and when people are just falling apart,
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.140]   two years got people through a lot of things.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:00.060]   So if you could, as an advisor, if you could just get your clients through two years, their
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.820]   portfolios could recover, etc.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.820]   I think that's worth money.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.180]   Is it worth money for everybody?
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.180]   I don't know.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.240]   I don't think so.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.940]   But is it worth money for some people?
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.940]   Absolutely.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.660]   Now let's move into the world of financial planning.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.380]   Every day on this show in public, I do financial planning in public and I try to point out
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:15.380]   the efficiencies.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.900]   Just a moment ago, I made this long speech about business stuff.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.340]   If a good financial advisor can come in and can start readjusting the assets, readjusting
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:28.740]   where the debts are, moving things over to the deductible side, moving things intelligently,
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:31.500]   there's a lot of benefit there from that as well.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   And then maybe there's other things.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.420]   So for example, I always, after I read Networking with the Affluent, my goal was always, "How
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.460]   can I bring my clients lots of money?"
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.340]   So in addition to working with me on their money management, they get other benefits,
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:46.580]   whether it's more business to them or jobs for their teenagers or whatever it is.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.420]   How can I be a connector?
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.620]   I've paid lots of money to people just to be connected to them.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:57.020]   So why shouldn't I go ahead and bill my client's taxable account with their investment advice
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:01.180]   fees so now they can deduct those fees against their profits and that be the method of them
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.140]   transferring money from their pocket into mine for the comprehensive services that I
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.340]   offer?
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:10.200]   So that's just kind of scratching the surface.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:16.420]   And I think that there is enough value there that good advisors would be able to still
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:20.580]   make a good value proposition to their clients.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.180]   Can all advisors do that?
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.180]   No.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.740]   But can good advisors make it in that place?
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:25.740]   I think they can.
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.540]   And I just say this.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.500]   I would never work as a financial advisor.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:35.060]   The big Ballyhoo thing these days is basically this.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:47.540]   Well we recognize that there's a specialty of financial planning and advice that has
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.500]   value and maybe it's just technical knowledge or maybe it's a budget analysis, but it's
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.900]   certainly not investments.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:58.020]   So what you should always do is you should go and put all your money into index funds
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:02.820]   and then if you need an advisor, you should go and hire an hourly fee advisor.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.140]   That's a common piece of advice.
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:08.540]   I've never hired one of those hourly fee advisors myself.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:12.100]   I can't comment on the competence of those people.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.700]   I'm sure many of them are competent and many of them are incompetent.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:20.900]   All I know is for me and for some of the good advisors that I know, I would never work in
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:26.380]   that business because with the skills that a good financial advisor has, if you don't
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.960]   have the profitability to make at least a few hundred thousand dollars a year if not
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.560]   half a million or a million bucks, it's just not worth it.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.900]   Why would I go and work for a flat fee of $200 an hour?
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:41.020]   I've constantly got to go and develop more clients.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:45.700]   Why would I do that when I can go and serve people in other formats and in other ways?
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.620]   So that's the honest truth.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:54.060]   It sounds probably a little bit crass, but at the end of the day, I'm convinced there
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:58.720]   will always be a market for good advisors and that those markets, those advisors should
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:05.080]   work really hard to make sure that they can actually deliver on their value proposition
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.180]   and it's up to individual advisors and individual clients to work it out.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:13.100]   I had clients, I had prospective clients that I was very good friends with that never hired
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.140]   me because they just said, "Joshua, I love working with you.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.500]   I want to be friends with you, but I'm not going to pay you this."
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.980]   On the other hand, I had clients that did and they were very happy and cried when I
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:22.980]   left.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:27.500]   But that's the best I can get to with kind of having an honest, objective discussion
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:33.220]   of the different scenarios and all I know to do is to leave it up to the individuals
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.460]   to say, "It's my money.
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:35.980]   Nobody cares about your money more than you do.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:43.060]   I'm going to make sure that I get value from an advisor if I'm going to hire one."
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.060]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:50.420]   If you have time, do you have any suggestions on finding that quality advisor?
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.420]   I have no idea.
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.420]   You know, I've had an advisor-
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.420]   Interviewing people?
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:54.420]   Interviewing people?
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:02.380]   Yeah, I had an advisor for a long time, which I hate it when my brain stops working.
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:05.380]   Sometimes that happens after I do Q&A for a long time.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.660]   I can't remember the name of my own advertiser.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.740]   The planning network that I used to advertise for on the show all the time was the best
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.740]   that I got.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   I struggled with-
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.740]   Oh, Paladin?
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:18.740]   Yeah, Paladin.
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.740]   Paladin, that was who it was.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:20.740]   Paladin, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:25.780]   I didn't have any kind of falling out with them.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.340]   I had a lot of good stories.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:32.940]   I would say the clients who went to them and hired one of their advisors or met with one
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:39.460]   of their advisors, about 80% of the time I got a great story.
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:43.260]   There were a handful of kind of, "Eh, this was okay."
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:48.680]   I didn't ever get any disastrous stories of, "Oh, this was terrible," but I got a few bits
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:51.220]   of feedback with people just saying, "Well, it was okay.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.400]   It was fine, but it wasn't anything special."
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.420]   That was the best that I could come up with for a while on ways to refer it.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:06.500]   The problem is, I think my guess is right now, I think Garrett Gunderson, who runs The
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.780]   Wealth Factory, is probably doing a good job.
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.860]   I have not met Garrett.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.100]   I have not talked to him.
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:17.580]   All I know is when I see his media that he's creating, he's doing the right job of focusing
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.100]   on the right factors.
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.140]   The big thing is he's working with entrepreneurs primarily.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:28.900]   Again, when I come down to it, I think delivering on alpha is the hardest sales proposition,
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:36.780]   but yet there's tremendous opportunity to deliver on, first of all, to deliver beta
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.380]   is one possibility.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:47.060]   Then with behavioral management, with personal finance management, with good financial planning,
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:50.660]   with good asset protection planning, et cetera, I think the value proposition there for wealthy
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.220]   people is huge.
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.140]   I've wrestled with this because one of the things I've thought about, I want to serve
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.060]   this market because I'm convinced that, and I try to prove it in public every day, I'm
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:04.460]   convinced that I could give me the average six-figure earner.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:09.380]   I'm convinced that I could deliver, I don't know how to put the right numbers on it, I
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.860]   can deliver millions of dollars of value if you give me the right circumstances and you
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:17.900]   give me the ability to work with somebody for a period of time.
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:22.620]   What the right way to do that is, is hard to figure out.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:26.740]   I've thought, "Well, maybe I should go ahead and start a financial planning firm."
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:32.180]   When I originally started Radical Personal Finance, I started a firm and then I shattered
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.540]   it before it got approved by FINRA.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:37.780]   At this point in time, I never want to be involved with FINRA again.
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:44.020]   In the United States, the money management business has gotten so regulated that basically,
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:50.620]   as I see it in terms of legally and otherwise, you can't do anything at all interesting.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:56.260]   If you're going to do business in the United States, basically you become an unpaid spy
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.260]   for the federal government.
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.580]   I have no interest in wasting my time as an unpaid spy.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:01.780]   That's not my interest.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:07.580]   I'm not interested in that business and I think it's utterly wrong what the United States
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:10.580]   is doing to people.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.700]   Many financial advisor commentators, all they want to do is keep on cheerleading.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:20.020]   At this point, although if I went broke, I would probably go back to that business just
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:24.220]   because I don't know of a place where I could make more money faster than going back to
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.400]   what I know and doing that and feel good about it.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:35.100]   In the middle of that, there are lots of ethical, competent advisors who are willing to work
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:38.780]   in that market and they can do what's best for their clients in the constraints of that.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.460]   But I don't ever have any interest in going back to the United States and going into that
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.460]   kind of market.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.860]   I see nothing but doom for that.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:46.900]   You see it reflected.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:53.420]   You see that the advisors are so scared and all the firms, the lawyers run the firms.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:57.860]   Because of that, you have almost no ability to do something that actually interests people.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.220]   I used to push the boundaries, but I never pushed the boundaries as much as I do now.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.340]   I never pushed them legally or ethically, but what I mean by push the boundaries is
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:09.260]   you push the boundaries in terms of the things that you tell your clients to do.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.100]   But why am I going to sit around?
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:17.820]   If I know that I can't make any difference in this client's life by delivering alpha
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.940]   and I know that that's a lost proposition, why am I not going to spend time consulting
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.660]   with them on the marketing their business?
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:29.340]   I know that if I bring my marketing skill to them, we can double their business and
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:32.460]   now all of a sudden it's really good, but that was where I was always stuck.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.940]   I'm supposed to be a financial advisor.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.060]   I'm supposed to talk about stocks.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.060]   I don't care about stocks.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:39.060]   I care about doubling your business because if you double your business, double your income,
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:42.140]   even if you put the money in cash, you wind up wealthier than trying to figure out how
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.420]   to get another 23 basis points of alpha.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.860]   I've given up on the wealth advisory business in the United States.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:55.380]   I have seriously considered starting some kind of formal firm offshore.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.860]   I think that there's a possibility there.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:03.340]   The problem is that that structure gives you more freedom as an advisor, I think, but most
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.700]   Americans, which is where the primary market that I would do in, are so scared of moving
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:10.820]   offshore and perhaps rightly so.
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:15.260]   I don't know, but most Americans are so scared of moving offshore that that would be really
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.340]   a tough value proposition to make.
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:25.380]   Then finally, as a way of earning money, the friction of paying advisory fees, sorry, when
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:32.060]   you take fees off of the management of assets, it's a very low friction event for the client,
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:36.020]   which is why most people don't mind paying fees because it's low friction.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.700]   It has a low saliency.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.780]   I know my advisor deducts the quarterly fees, but whatever.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.180]   It's just coming off my portfolio.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:49.300]   Now, when somebody looks at it and says, "Well, what would happen if you get 1% underperformance
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:50.660]   over the course of 40 years?"
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:54.300]   It's a big number, which is why you better be, if you're going to be doing that business,
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.020]   you better be confident that you're doing everything you can to deliver far bigger than
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.420]   that number, which is, for most people, for most advisors at least, probably a hard thing
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.340]   to answer.
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:08.660]   But in terms of getting paid from a business owner perspective, there's no, I don't know
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:14.780]   of any lower friction way to get paid where your business model works other than managing
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780]   assets.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:20.620]   When you take the custodianship of assets away, you get very high salient fees, and
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.700]   now it becomes a much harder business to pursue.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:31.140]   For now, here's one of the complaints of the financial advisor business.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:35.460]   People say, "I've got a net worth of, let's just say $5 million, wealthy guys.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.260]   We're going to deal in the world of wealthy people.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:44.020]   I got a net worth of $5 million, but $2 million of that is in real estate, $2 million is in
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.820]   my business, and $1 million of that is in my 401(k).
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.060]   So Mr. Financial Advisor, here's $1 million."
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:55.220]   Well, financial advisor says, "All right, well, I'll charge you 150 basis points on
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.220]   that.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.260]   So I'm going to get $15,000 off your million dollars."
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:02.860]   And now all of a sudden, you're in a situation where, wait, how much value are you adding
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:06.060]   on a million dollar portfolio for $15,000 a year?
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.140]   Well, maybe some, maybe not some.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:12.260]   So some advisors charge fees based upon a percentage of net worth.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:17.020]   And they try to do this because they're trying to relieve the frustration that clients say
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:19.780]   have, "You always want to get me to buy more stocks, or you always want to get me to buy
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.140]   more insurance.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:26.980]   And should I go and pay off this debt over here that I have on my business of a million
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.220]   dollars, or should I invest another million dollars with you?"
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:32.100]   Well, the complaint is that due to conflict of interest, the advisor is just going to
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:35.420]   say, "Put a million dollars with me, because if you put a million dollars with me, then
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.700]   I'll make you more money, so don't pay off that debt."
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.240]   But I really think I should pay off the debt.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:44.660]   So some advisors charge their fees based upon, not based upon assets under management, but
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.460]   based upon net worth.
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.680]   I've not met many clients who like that.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:56.940]   Even though the client might understand, "Well, maybe that's going to release a conflict of
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:01.400]   interest and smooth things out a little bit, I don't see what impact you're going to make
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.140]   on my $2 million of real estate.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.140]   That's not your deal.
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:06.020]   I don't see what impact you're going to make on my business, $2 million.
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.340]   I'm just going to pay you on the million dollars over here."
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.440]   And so advisors are constantly stuck.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:14.340]   And then when you move into a world where you've got to pay, you're going to write me
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:21.980]   a check for $15,000 every year or $3,000 per quarter, it becomes more difficult.
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:26.820]   So I think as an advisor, the business is broken.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:35.140]   Because as an advisor, you've got to really believe in what you're doing in order to go
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:41.380]   that model instead of the model where the fees are less salient, the clients are easier,
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.380]   et cetera.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.500]   And there are still enough people who are willing to pay those fees that that other
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.740]   model still works.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.460]   Now, will it not work 10 years from now?
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.900]   I don't know.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:55.100]   All I know is that if you don't custodian assets, but you try to work with the wealthy,
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.100]   that's a tough scenario.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:59.460]   So what I've basically done is I don't think I'll ever start a firm.
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:03.100]   Just because dealing with the offshore, I don't want to deal with the United States,
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.620]   but yet dealing with the offshore stigma is difficult.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.200]   Some people are doing it.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.540]   Maybe you can do it if you start a bank or something.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:12.900]   There are ways to do it.
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.340]   But I don't want to deal with the US government, and yet going offshore just seems too difficult.
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.700]   And it is a big significant thing.
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:24.900]   So what you see is that a lot of people do is they go to a combination of information
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:33.340]   and classes and education mixed with sometimes commissions or some other compensation model
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:36.700]   on investment placements, et cetera.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.500]   And the reason financial people do that is because it allows you to deliver the knowledge
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.860]   that's helpful.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:51.100]   And as long as you get your product mix right, it allows you to earn enough money and to
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:54.780]   do it in a way that's efficient enough where you can make a lot of profit.
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:59.460]   And then if you work out the deals on the back end and you do it properly, do it ethically,
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:03.600]   disclose it, et cetera, you can put together enough profit without dealing with the formal
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.740]   custodianship of assets.
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.980]   So that's why you kind of have these competing industries.
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:14.940]   You have the newsletter industry versus the money management industry.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.700]   There are some sweet spots.
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:20.020]   There are some sweet spots in trust services.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:24.660]   There's perhaps a sweet spot in family office management.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:28.760]   But just speaking very broadly, those are the models that I see and why I think the
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.260]   different models work.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.620]   >>Steve: That's great.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.300]   Thank you very much.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.140]   Good questions, guys.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.140]   Anything else, Tim?
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:39.140]   Go ahead.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.140]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:41.700]   >>Tim: Do you know anybody who's used Garrett Gunderson?
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.460]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.460]   His model is very interesting.
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:49.100]   >>Steve: I don't know of anybody who's gone through it.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.420]   And I need to, I've been meaning to, over the next year, I'm going to build a bunch
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.860]   more relationships with some of the guys I respect.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.180]   I had people ask me about him.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.540]   That's when I started researching him.
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:04.060]   I had listeners wrote to me and said, "What do you think of what he's doing?"
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:07.780]   I need to reach out to him and go talk to him and see.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:12.740]   Because probably, just for me, what I need to probably do is collaborate with guys that
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:16.940]   I respect, like what he's doing.
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:17.940]   So I haven't met him.
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:20.180]   I don't know him, nor have I gone through any client services.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:24.700]   All I know is that when you watch his free marketing materials, he's focusing on the
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:29.800]   right things, which is financial planning and behavior management.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.260]   So he's focusing on the right things.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:35.500]   And because he's focusing on the right things, I have a feeling that he's probably put in
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.420]   place the proper back end.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.260]   But he's not marketing Alpha.
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:41.260]   That's the key.
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:42.260]   He's not marketing Alpha.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.540]   He's marketing the rest of it.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:49.180]   I need to dig into his product mix and buy some of his stuff and see how he structures
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.180]   stuff.
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:51.180]   I haven't done it.
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:52.180]   I've been too busy.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.180]   My own fault.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.460]   But if any clients have gone through his stuff, or if any of you know Garrett, or Garrett
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.500]   if you're listening, reach out to me.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.820]   I'm sure radicalpersonalfinance.com because I like the free stuff that he's doing.
