[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   you get at today's deep question, which is,
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.040]   is our relationship to time broken?
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:18.720]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.060]   the show about living and working deeply
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.160]   in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.300]   I'm here in my deep work HQ,
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.900]   joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.760]   Jesse, I'm gonna describe to you
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.340]   as my world-famous producer, Jesse,
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.380]   now that you've made your international media debut.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.600]   So for, we've mentioned this before on the show,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.980]   but for a while last fall,
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.260]   there was a reporter from the Financial Times
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.220]   who was hanging out at the HQ at some of my events
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.780]   and doing some interviews for a profile they wrote,
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.560]   or they were writing about me for the Financial Times,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.360]   and that came out last weekend.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.940]   I'll load it on the screen here
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.500]   for those who are watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.820]   It's episode 239.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.240]   Also, you can find this at thedeeplife.com.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.300]   So here's me looking heroic for this magazine article,
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.540]   "How Cal Newport Rewrote the Productivity Gospel."
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.380]   Did you know, Jesse,
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.300]   this ended up being the cover of the magazine?
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.140]   - That's awesome.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.700]   I mean, it's a sweet picture.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.060]   - That's the parking lot behind the HQ.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700]   - Yeah, I mean, I was looking around the article
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.380]   and I noticed a lot of the...
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.620]   - Yeah, so I've only skimmed this
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.880]   'cause I can't stand reading about myself,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.100]   but what's important, what's important is if we,
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.540]   and this is a long article, which is a whole other issue.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.820]   There's the magazine cover there.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.620]   All right, so if we scroll down farther in this article,
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.620]   we see, ta-da, his producer, Jesse, was already there.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.260]   I think that's a, a lot is packed into that phrase, Jesse.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.580]   I think this is, with less, more is being conveyed.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.540]   - Yeah, she was cool.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.420]   - This is your international press debut.
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.500]   I mean, I gotta say it, I don't know if this is
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.820]   but self-deprecation or whatever.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.420]   I really am baffled by the idea
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.380]   that anyone would wanna read 5,000 words about my story.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.100]   Like, I get that my ideas are interesting.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.860]   Like, that I get.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.140]   I'm not that interesting of a person.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.100]   - I disagree.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   I'd definitely read, I mean, I'd read it
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.860]   even if I didn't know you 'cause I was always a fan before.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.420]   - Here's a short version of my autobiography.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.260]   I sat and I thought a lot in between reading.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.680]   - Yeah, but you took a lot of action.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.260]   - The end, well, anyways, so Courtney was great
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.220]   and I'm sure the article is great, a very talented writer.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.420]   I remain humbly baffled by the idea
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.900]   that people would wanna spend that much time
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.180]   learning about my story, but there you go.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.740]   But it is the international press debut of Jesse.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.540]   So for that, we reached a milestone.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.700]   I think it's important.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.420]   One other piece of logistical notes to work on
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.780]   before we get into it, a logistical note
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.960]   before we get into the meat of today's episode.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.920]   So Jesse, you know I have this longtime partnership
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.940]   with the writer Scott Young.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.380]   And we have these two online courses.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.220]   You've taken at least one of them, right?
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.060]   - Yeah.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.460]   - So we have this course, Top Performer,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.340]   based off of So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.740]   And we have this newer course, Life of Focus,
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.220]   which is based off of deep work, digital minimalism,
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.300]   and Scott's book, Ultra Learning.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.780]   Well, this week, the week that this episode's coming out,
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.540]   Ultra Learning is open for registration.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.020]   So maybe once or twice a year,
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.080]   we open it to register a new class.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.940]   So it's open until Friday.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.940]   The website is life-of-focus-course.com.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.220]   So lifeoffocuscourse.com with dashes in between every word.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.660]   Anyways, I figured instead of me trying to explain
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.700]   what's going on in this course,
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.220]   I would have Scott call in,
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.180]   join me briefly for a quick conversation
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.160]   about what's going on with this course, where it came from.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.900]   Also, I make fun of him for that terrible URL.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   So here is Scott calling in to help explain this course.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.180]   All right, Scott, thanks for calling in
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   to help me talk about our online course, Life of Focus.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.340]   Let me first of all, just make sure
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.300]   I'm getting the basic information out to you, my listeners.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.060]   This course that Scott and I did is called Life of Focus.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.060]   It's found at the website lifeoffocuscourse.com
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.180]   with dashes in between all those words.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.180]   So life-of-focus-course.com.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.660]   That's where you can sign up.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.060]   It is open this week.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.000]   So the week this episode came out,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.940]   it is open for new registrations
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.300]   before we close it back down again on Friday.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.100]   Now, Scott, when I tell people about this course,
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.940]   I say it's built around three books.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.260]   So from my library,
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260]   it's built around deep work and digital minimalism.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.060]   And from your library, your fantastic book, Ultra Learning.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.260]   So it's a course that has one month dedicated
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.820]   to ideas from each of those books.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.300]   That's the high-level way I talk about it.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.380]   You understand the details better.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.340]   I feel like your hands have gotten more dirty
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.340]   with the underlying coding of this course.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.300]   And I can tell you guys,
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.520]   it is not easy to build an online course.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.100]   So I thought I would throw it to you just to explain,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.380]   first of all, for the listeners who's curious,
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.180]   what happens during each of these months?
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.300]   So during the deep work month,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.700]   the minimalism month, and the Ultra Learning month,
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.620]   what type of things are happening
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.780]   if you're a student who has signed up for this course?
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.500]   - Right, so we've divided the course
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.560]   into these three one-month challenges.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.900]   So there's a focus work, focus life,
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.700]   and focus mind challenge.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.820]   And you're right, they draw on the stuff
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.260]   that you've probably already read
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.220]   if you're in the Cal Newport idea space.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.620]   The ideas are not going to be radically new.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.260]   They're gonna be things that you're familiar with.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.420]   But what's gonna be different about the course
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.540]   is we're gonna go into the real nitty-gritty
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.020]   of getting the details right
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.940]   and provide you with this sort of actionable template
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.660]   for actually making it a part of your life.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.900]   Because of course, that's the big stumbling block.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.540]   I mean, it's easy to say, yeah, I need to do more deep work.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.460]   But how do you actually get that to happen?
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.980]   And what we found from working with students
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.860]   is that there's a lot of these little details
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.220]   that need to be gotten right.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.340]   Needs to be about tracking how much time
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.140]   you're actually spending doing deep work.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.660]   It's about figuring out what your rituals are
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.100]   for getting into the deep work,
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.820]   for getting out of the deep work.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.260]   It's about communicating when you're gonna be deep working
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.180]   with other people.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.700]   And so, this is easy to talk about,
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.740]   but it's something that we actually spend a lot of time
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.140]   implementing in the course.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.900]   So if you work on the course,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.740]   the first month is going to be a month entirely dedicated
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.500]   to improving the quality of your deep work.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.620]   The second month is gonna be entirely dedicated
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   to improving your digital online social media usage
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620]   in your leisure time.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.360]   So we'll begin with the digital declutter
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.340]   and we'll work on, not just, okay,
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.260]   I'm gonna just get rid of everything and then figure it out.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.460]   We're gonna create a new system for you
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.220]   so that you can have something that not only gets you off
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.180]   of this sort of algorithmic spiral of content,
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.260]   but gives you something better
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.520]   so that you don't feel like you wanna go back to it
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.460]   after three months.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.420]   And then finally, in the Focus Mind Challenge,
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.820]   we're going to tackle a project to learn
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.980]   or make something new so you can reclaim
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.780]   all of that useful time and have some more interesting
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.740]   hobbies, learn something important, really stretch yourself.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.180]   So that's the idea of the course.
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.240]   And so if a three month deep dive experience
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.520]   into those kinds of self-improvement goals
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   sounds like something for you,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.740]   then maybe Life of Focus will be a good course.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.700]   - And this was the big idea we had
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.700]   when we were working on designing this course
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.140]   was the clarity of having each month be built around
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.940]   a singular project or goal.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.280]   So you have an objective each month that you're focusing on
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.900]   and in the pursuit of that project or that goal,
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.780]   you are mastering a lot of the ancillary skills
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.780]   that are related to it.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.060]   So you're gonna be overhauling the way you schedule
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.560]   your time and deep work, et cetera,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.500]   during the deep work month.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.800]   You have a concrete goal, but in the pursuit of that goal,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.580]   you get much better at integrating deep work in general.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.940]   During the digital minimalism month,
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.180]   you are going through a declutter process,
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.820]   really systematically changing your relationship to tools.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.280]   And as you do that, you pick up all these other ideas
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.520]   around minimalism and the deep mind.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.880]   You're working on a particular building,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.780]   this intellectual output, but by doing this,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.420]   I'm learning what it feels like to actually take my mind
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.040]   now that it's uncluttered and actually put it to work.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.980]   So that I think is one of the cool aspects of this.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.420]   So you're getting regular information.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.140]   Every week, you're getting this regular information.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.180]   Some of it directly related to helping you
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.580]   with the big projects you're working on.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.020]   Some of it just more general
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.740]   about the general theme of that month.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.300]   And I mean, Scott, I don't think people probably appreciate
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.140]   the amount of time you and I thought about this
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.920]   to get that balance exactly right.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.580]   I mean, you and I have done another course together,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.740]   Top Performer.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.560]   You've done other online courses as well without me.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.220]   And so there's this big base of experience
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.500]   that was being pulled from when we put this course together
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   to try to get that perfect balance of concrete,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.580]   regular information plus instruction.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.680]   And I gotta say, I think we really hit it with this one.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.980]   I'm really proud of this particular course.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.420]   I think that's why it's been pretty popular
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.920]   ever since we first launched it back
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.580]   in those early pandemic days when it first went live.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.080]   - Well, I think one of the things that is sort of underrated
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.460]   is you can read a book and you can get lots of ideas.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.660]   You can listen to this podcast,
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.100]   but it doesn't always translate into action.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.820]   It doesn't always just spontaneously generate this system
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.260]   that you actually use in your life.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.100]   And so that's why we're really excited
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.660]   about this course format,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.240]   because it is really trying to guide you
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.500]   through that process.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.260]   And this is kind of like a masterclass.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.500]   So if you have experimented with some of this stuff before,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.980]   but you don't feel like you're exactly
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.260]   where you'd like to be,
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.580]   then this is something that could come in handy.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.060]   And we really spend a lot of time focusing on the details.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.380]   One of the things that you can see when you join the course
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.340]   is that we have these worksheet pages
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.080]   where we go through the step-by-step,
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.140]   how do you set up these routines?
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.940]   And then we have these really lengthy discussion pages
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.860]   where we have all these people
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.180]   who are weighing in their comments,
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.860]   like how do I make decisions
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.060]   about whether to count certain things as deep work or not?
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.460]   Or how do I make a decision
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.180]   about how to deal with this particular kind of challenge?
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.440]   And so it ends up becoming this library
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   of dealing with that nitty gritty,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.180]   because it is those details,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.180]   which is whether you succeed or fail
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.660]   with these kinds of attempts.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.300]   And so the big ideas you're already familiar with,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.220]   you're probably already sold on the need
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.760]   to have more deep work and have a deeper, more focused life,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.340]   but it's often the implementation where people get hung up.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.140]   And that's what I think we're really proud of,
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.140]   of kind of putting together all these little pieces
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.820]   in this course.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.700]   - And here's a little secret backstory to this course.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.160]   We had a lot of time to get the ideas right,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.980]   because actually a lot of the filming that happened
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.680]   for this course was deep in the early days of the pandemic.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.980]   So while everyone was at home,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.580]   Scott and I would be surreptitiously sneaking off
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.860]   to film studios with our crews, looking around,
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.340]   everything was empty and we could just sit
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.180]   and film and think.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.820]   So we actually were able to take advantage
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.380]   of the whole world being shut down
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.200]   to put all of our energy into making this course successful.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.120]   So let's make sure that you have all the right information.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.020]   So again, as Scott said, if you're mastered the basics,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.260]   you've heard me talk about this,
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.460]   you've heard Scott talk about this,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.340]   you've read his books, you've read my books,
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.100]   and now you're ready to go to the next level,
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.580]   you should consider this course.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.140]   This is for working deeper, living deeper,
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.060]   and thinking deeper.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.140]   If you're ready to do those three things,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.540]   then you might wanna check this out.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.880]   So go to lifeoffocuscourse.com with dashes,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.800]   life-of-focus-course.com.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.300]   And there's a lot of information on there.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.220]   You can learn a lot more about the course.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.780]   There's testimonials from people.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.820]   You can see how it's actually broken up
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.540]   and really consider, okay, is this for me or not?
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.220]   Because we have our students go through this course,
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.860]   roughly speaking as a cohort, it's timed registration.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.500]   So it's this week, the week this podcast episode airs,
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.700]   Monday to Friday, is the week that the course is open.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.980]   So if you're interested,
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.080]   go over to lifeoffocuscourse.com with dashes right now,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.580]   because we only have a week
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.300]   in which we can actually sign people up.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.660]   All right, so Scott, I'm excited about this.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.420]   I hope you and I have some of our,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.180]   more of our listeners and readers join.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.620]   I always enjoy following the progress of our students
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.580]   when we have a new cohort coming through.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.520]   So thanks for jumping on the show.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.700]   And also thanks for keeping us with,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.120]   I was gonna say, and I don't wanna self-deprecate us.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.460]   Our URL game is not as good as it could be.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.540]   We've got a lot of dashes.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.060]   Now, I think we're stuck with this
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.440]   because we did the course that we've been running
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.160]   since 2014, Top Performer.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.740]   I think we had the dashes in it.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.300]   So now we're following that convention,
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.980]   but man, I bet there's someone out there who's-
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.420]   - Well, it's the magic of Google and websites
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.660]   that it's pretty easy to find on our website as well.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.660]   So we did, we spared the expense on the URL
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.460]   so we could put it into film production.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.700]   - Exactly, a legal, a legal surreptitious,
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.580]   early pandemic, anti-lockdown film production.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.980]   No, the thing is we're writers, Scott.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.860]   You and I are writers.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.280]   So we don't think about reading the names of URLs.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.920]   We figure on written out, things look really clear.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.560]   We're not meant for the- - Too much hypertext.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.920]   That's too much experience for us.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.040]   We're not used to pitching it on-
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.760]   - No, exactly, exactly.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.320]   But anyway, Scott, thanks for calling in
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.360]   and everyone check that out if it sounds interesting.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.600]   - All right, so thank you, Scott,
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.180]   for calling in, check out that course.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.880]   What I wanna talk about today in today's episode
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.840]   is motivated by an article from the New York Times
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   that quite a few of you, my alert listeners sent to me.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.760]   I'm gonna load this article on the screen here
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.600]   so we can mark it up.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.520]   So again, this is at youtube.com/countedportmedia
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.640]   episode 239 or thedeeplife.com.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.800]   I've loaded this up on my screen.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.200]   The title of this article, which came out on March 4th,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   so this is recent, is "Time Has Been Codified,
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.080]   Has Been Codified and Commodified."
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.220]   Ooh, I mixed those together.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.820]   Time has been codified and commodified.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.020]   This is a mouthful, Jesse.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.380]   They should do a zock dock ad, somehow this title
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.180]   Zach doc.com.com.com.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.060]   I applaud O'Dell.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.380]   Alright, let me try this again, guys.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.720]   Time has been codified and commodified.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.400]   Genie Odell wants to set it free.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.580]   So this is an article.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.240]   It's a profile of Jenny O'dell.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.300]   Gini Odell is 36 years old.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.680]   She's a, an artist who in long time had a digital art, I don't know what it was, I
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.160]   guess, professorship position at Stanford.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.660]   She does sort of ecologically informed found object style art.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.200]   She wears complicated glasses.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   She lives on the West coast.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.000]   You know what we're talking about?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.420]   Um, Odell and I's paths have intertwined before back in 2019.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.900]   She released a book called how to do nothing resisting the attention economy.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.720]   This came out the same week as my 2019 book, digital minimalism.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.380]   There are some similarities in those two books.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.200]   There's a lot of press.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.960]   We ended up being combined together in.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.740]   So there's a lot of coverage where our, our trajectories were
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.380]   temporarily thrown together.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.340]   So for example, back then, uh, Gia Tolentino at the New Yorker published a big double
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.380]   review in the magazine of my book and Jenny's book and sort of contrasted them.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.900]   The New York times book review did a big thing that talked about both of our books.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.500]   I think the ringer did something.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.800]   So we were sort of on a parallel path for a little while because our
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.080]   books came out at the same time.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.460]   Anyway, she has a new book out called saving time, sort of a
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.980]   follow-up to how to do nothing.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.840]   This article is about it.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.940]   I think it generates some interesting, relatively deep points
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.460]   about our relationship with time.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.580]   And so I wanted to go through in today's deep type, I was going to go through
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.460]   some big points from this article as a jumping off point to get at today's
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.340]   deep question, which is, is our relationship to time broken?
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.720]   So we're going to do a deep dive based off Jenny's article.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.240]   Then I have a collection of questions and case studies that are all connected
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.980]   to the same theme about thinking through our relationship to time, work in time,
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.000]   time management, et cetera.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.620]   So that do we have a broken relationship with time?
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.760]   We'll get into that with the questions.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.240]   And then the final segment will be something interesting, an interesting
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.800]   article that people sent to me through my interesting account, newport.com email
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.940]   address, this something interesting article also loosely relates to this theme as well.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.320]   So it's a whole episode about our relationship to time, our
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.580]   troubled relationship to time.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.720]   All right, before I jump into some quotes from this New York Times article, I'll
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.900]   give a bit of a warning here.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.640]   Odell is a, an academic thinker.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.880]   So the way she talks about things or the way people talk about her work may seem
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:07.000]   somewhat jargony or a little bit sort of elitist or aloof to sort of the standard
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   person who's thinking about the relationship to time.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:15.340]   The, I guess the response I want to give is Odell should be taken seriously.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.960]   I would say of that sort of San Francisco, Brooklyn axis of the post-capitalist
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.300]   crowds, the people who are very much in the mood right now of writing about
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.680]   post-capitalism and, and the way that there's all these forces that are sort
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.920]   of disintegrating the American social fabric due to exploitative capitalists,
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.380]   extraction, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.080]   Odell is by far, I think one of the more serious voices.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.480]   So instead of just regurgitating Mad Libs styles, different reconfigurations
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.320]   of ideas she's seen on Twitter, they get re-likes.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.400]   Odell's actually a deep thinker on this.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.520]   She's heavily influenced in particular by the Italian communist
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.180]   philosopher, Franco Berardi.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.080]   A good way of understanding her work is taking Berardi's work, his critique of
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.220]   this would have been like late 20th century capitalism, and she's moving it
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.820]   forward to 21st century digital attention, economy, capitalism,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.460]   digital knowledge, work capitalism.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.300]   So there's actually, I think a more serious intellectual foundation
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.460]   with Odell that's not found in a lot of other sort of very online
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.220]   type commentators on this issue.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.400]   So she speaks in a different language than you or I, she's an academic, but
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.460]   let's take it seriously nonetheless.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:21.940]   All right.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.360]   So I'm going to load up the article again here.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.260]   There's a couple of points I want to highlight, and then we're going to
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.420]   riff off this into my own takes on things.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:35.520]   So early on in the article, we hear about her reaction, what happened after her
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.180]   book, How to Do Nothing became a bestseller back in 2019.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.460]   So according to the article, Odell said that when she heard from readers,
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:49.440]   they often told her that they didn't have enough time in the day to reconsider
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.900]   how they approach productivity.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.020]   So How to Do Nothing was a challenge to productivity culture.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.380]   Readers came back to her and said, I like what you're saying,
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.460]   but I can't act on it.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.060]   I'm too busy.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.580]   So this is a, think of this as like an origin story of sorts.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.820]   For her new book, Saving Time, where she said, I'm going to look closely
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.120]   then at our relationship with time.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.580]   All right.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.760]   So scrolling forward here more in the article is a couple of the
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.340]   quotes I wanted to highlight.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.980]   All right.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:22.220]   So later on, we see this kind of grounding is central to Odell's
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.140]   relationship with time, the one she forged while writing this book.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.260]   So what precedes this in the article is Odell actually instructing the New
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.880]   York Times reporter who was going to profile her to go to a specific spot in
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.420]   Manhattan or in between two row houses.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.200]   There's this massive ancient rock formation that's maintained.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.420]   And she said, go there and just be there and marvel and how interesting and
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.580]   unusual this thing is in the middle of the city.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.860]   So there's grounding that's being referenced here as Odell argued in her
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.860]   book, Saving Time, that we need to ground our experience of time and actual real
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.660]   things and experiences and noticing.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.460]   She goes on to elaborate about this notion of grounding.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.700]   This is Odell speaking here.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.860]   This is probably something that a lot of people experienced
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.420]   during the pandemic, she said.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.660]   There was some assurance and seeing ecologically speaking, big things like
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.140]   migratory birds, seeing the flowers come back and seeing that this goes on.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.040]   I think that this was very therapeutic for people.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.460]   It obviously was for me.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.700]   Your body also has that kind of time.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.900]   She continued, you are not, you are in that.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.020]   You are not just in a calendar box.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   So this is a, this is a key point I want to come back to.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.700]   Let me just do a little snide aside.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.100]   I try not to do these things, but a little snide aside, this is probably
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.820]   something a lot of people experienced during the pandemic.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.460]   Elite knowledge workers working from home experiences during the pandemic.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.340]   That's about 30% of the population.
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.380]   The majority of the population still had to do their jobs, but let's put that aside.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.460]   Like as with my writing, this is a, this discussion of the codification
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.700]   and commodification of time is not meant for the entire population writ large,
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.620]   but more for highly autonomous knowledge workers.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.320]   All right.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.660]   One other thing before we get into our discussion here, she said, ultimately
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.700]   her goal in writing this book was to find a relationship
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.700]   to time that wasn't painful.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.260]   And while she wasn't, isn't living in bliss every moment of the day,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.580]   she says, she thinks she succeeded.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.100]   I feel better.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.780]   She said, time feels thicker.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.260]   It's made out of stuff.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.940]   It's made out of people and things that are in it.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.420]   It doesn't have as much of that empty grid a minute's kind of feeling.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.340]   When you start to think of time in more collective ways, trying to leave
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.700]   behind the individual time banks, it opens up the horizon of what's
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.620]   possible in your and others time together.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.300]   Okay.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.260]   So let me decode Odell for you here.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:44.140]   My take on what she is saying in part is that human beings are not naturally
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.460]   wired to think about time as an abstract substance to which we assign
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.620]   abstract knowledge work tasks.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:58.980]   This, uh, almost mathematical optimization problem of we have X minutes of time.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.500]   I have these different tasks and I can do an assignment of time to task.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.420]   This one needs this much time.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.300]   This means this much time.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.420]   Can we, can we fit how many things can we fit in where all the
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.060]   activities are abstract or digital.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.300]   They're occurring on a screen.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.340]   You're just hitting keys.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.220]   It's this, this, uh, being lost almost in this world, this world of the
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.420]   abstract signifier, not grounded in a concrete world of things around you.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.140]   So in other words, an interpretation of Odell would be to, to live by a time
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.020]   block plan of the type I talk about often on the show is in some degrees to be
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.220]   living at odds with human nature.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.380]   Time is somehow thicker and richer when you're instead able to focus your
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.940]   experience of time on interactions with people or experiences or a fierce
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.580]   attention to what's going on around you.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.220]   The migratory birds, the leaves are now out on this tree, the thorough approach
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.500]   to noticing and appreciating that gives us a human experience of time.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.780]   The, as she calls it, the empty grid of minutes.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.980]   So the time block plan that you're filling in is in some sense, not human.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.820]   It's something artificial that we've had to impose.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.220]   All right.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.300]   So here's my take on that.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:12.580]   I think she's right about the unnatural nature of the relationship to time.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.060]   That's required by modern knowledge work.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:22.140]   I say this often time block planning, for example, is very demanding and stressful.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.300]   It is why, for example, I'm really clear about only do it to the degree you have
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.820]   to do it once you shut down for the day.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.020]   Don't do it at night.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.340]   Don't do it on the weekends.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.540]   In the new version of the time block planner that's coming out this summer,
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.380]   by the way, it's spiral bound.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.340]   I'm very excited about this.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.700]   I've gotten rid of time blocking grids for the weekends altogether and
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.340]   having much consolidated weekend.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.620]   So called the weekend pages.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.780]   And it's, it's much more consolidated for much less informal plans.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.340]   That's because time block planning is hard and it's draining.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.900]   However, it is the reality of most knowledge work jobs today that it's
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.660]   your best bet for trying to get your arms around everything being thrown at
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.980]   you without completely being overwhelmed, without having to eat up every minute
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.540]   of your day, even outside of normal work hours, trying to keep up with work.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.420]   So it's the best defense we have against a difficult situation.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:20.660]   Um, where I disagree with Odell is in the discussion of what is causing
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.940]   these problems, I think for the elite online types, even for the very, uh,
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:31.060]   you know, engaged and smarter than me types like Odell, uh, influenced by,
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.900]   you know, especially early critical theories and, and, uh, the
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.420]   modernist offshoots of Marxism.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.780]   It's very tempting to try to understand everything through exploitative forces
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:49.340]   that are, if you're from a modern perspective, are exploitatively trying
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.940]   to extract value from your latent capital, uh, your latent capital value.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.740]   So as capital is trying to, um, extract value from you and your labor, or if
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.420]   you're of the more post-modernist set, it's more about exploitative forces,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.380]   trying to maintain power dynamics.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.540]   Odell's more from that older school, um, modernist sort of
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.100]   Marxist type, uh, line of thinking.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.740]   So a lot of what she would talk about pulls from sort of a gussied up version
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.220]   of base superstructure theory move from the early 20th century to the 20th.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.860]   First, the basis capitalism, the superstructure here are cultural forces.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.420]   Like, I don't know, she calls them the productivity bros, I guess in this,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.500]   in this worldview, James clear and Tim Ferriss, and I suppose myself is secretly
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.900]   tricking people into, uh, working more so that the owners of capital can better
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.860]   exploit labor from the alienated masses, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.220]   I think that's intellectually interesting.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.580]   I think it's why these type of theories have resurged, even though they fell
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.580]   out of favor in the sixties, they've resurged again in the very online, uh,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.620]   line types in the modern 21st century.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:02.020]   There's something there, but it doesn't match my on the ground observations of
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.500]   how we ended up in this place where time block planning is our only defense
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.460]   against these overwhelming onslaught of tasks.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.420]   I think the, the actual problem is much more proximate.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.700]   It's we have too much to do.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.540]   And I think the reason we have too much to do is to some degree, maybe about
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.900]   exploitative relationships with capital, but a lot of it has to do with, uh,
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.820]   culture and technology shifted.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:30.420]   And we did not shift along with it, any sort of meaningful, culturally accepted
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.980]   norms or boundaries for controlling workload.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:41.220]   When knowledge work collided with email, digital networks, computer-based
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.300]   productivity tools that meant that the individual worker now became a jack of
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.180]   all trades that could basically do anything.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.860]   We had no more specialization of labor.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.620]   You just, anything could come to any department who needs you can throw
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.180]   something your way and you can fill out a form and go on the Microsoft
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.300]   PowerPoint and make it happen.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.860]   I think this collision of knowledge work, which itself was quite new, only really
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.540]   emerging as a major sector in the 1950s or sixties, this collision in the nineties
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.380]   and early two thousands with technology was fast and we weren't prepared for it.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.780]   And we have no culturally accepted or organizationally accepted ways of
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.060]   understanding, well, how much work should someone be doing?
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.380]   How specialized should they do?
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.700]   How do we control the incoming work loads to keep that reasonable and aligned with
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.460]   how people's brains can actually work?
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:28.860]   The physical, the physical version of this thinking is something we did go through
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.220]   in the industrial sector in the early 20th century.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.260]   So the physical version of this thinking is, well, how much can a human body do?
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.220]   What's reasonable to ask a human body?
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.500]   How many, how safe, you know, how safe is the physical things you're doing in a
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:41.780]   factory?
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.100]   How many hours can we expect someone to actually work in a factory?
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.380]   How young should we tolerate someone actually being in one of these factories
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.900]   and the labor rights movements built around unions, as well as legislative
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.700]   action could come up with answers.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.660]   The fair language, fair labor standards act of the 1930s said the workday should
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.420]   be eight hours, 40 hours a week.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.460]   And if you want someone to work longer, you got to pay them a lot more.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.060]   And by the way, 12 year olds should not be working in the factories, though, as we
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.860]   saw in a recent, some recent reporting.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.500]   We've sort of slipped on that recently, but that's a whole other point.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.860]   Safety standards OSHA.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.580]   So we went through all this with physical, the physical activities of industrial
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:18.860]   labor.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.180]   We haven't done it with the intellectual activities of knowledge work.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.340]   What is a reasonable workload for a human brain to have to be juggling?
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:30.180]   What is a reasonable rate of switching back and forth between context that is
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:35.700]   compatible with a sustainable and not mentally deranging and fatiguing mode of
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.300]   work?
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.980]   How do we keep track of who's doing what?
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.700]   How do we assign, like when should be people working when it's this more highly
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.100]   autonomous energy-based knowledge work?
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.500]   Should it be based off workday hours?
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.540]   Should it be based on results?
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.460]   What's required to do that?
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:53.020]   All of this thinking basically has not yet been done in knowledge work.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.820]   And as a result, the system as pushed towards inevitably and relentlessly
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.980]   without the need of a secret cabal of capitalist and Tim Ferriss, it has pushed
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.860]   towards, we have more and more to do and everyone is exhausted.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.100]   And it happens in our life outside of work as well.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:13.260]   We don't have newly emerged cultural standards for in the modern 21st century
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.940]   dual income knowledge work family with the, the specter of whatever competitive
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.900]   college admissions lurking six years in the future.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.420]   Like what's the reasonable amount of activities for your kids to be doing or
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.340]   things for you to volunteer to, or different tasks to take on in your town.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.780]   We've lost the standard.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.980]   So we all do too much.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.220]   And I think this is where a big source of the exhaustion is coming from.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.020]   Now I think this is important because that's more tractable
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.220]   than the mustache twirlers.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:44.140]   When our issue is the mustache twirlers are secretly trying to exploit us.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.340]   And, you know, uh, through these base superstructure type forces, deploying
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.300]   their evil productivity, bro minions to try to trick us all into working too much
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.860]   more, what can we do Bolshevik revolution?
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.340]   All right.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.860]   Short of that, what are we supposed to do?
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.780]   But when we say instead, no guys, we just got, we don't have any
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.140]   standards is out of control.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.260]   Things change too fast.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.100]   This is, this has a response.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.460]   Let's catch up and let's start advocating for new ways of thinking about work and
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.460]   when work happens and how much work happens and how much work should be on
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.940]   someone's plate and how work is assigned and how we interact about it and what
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.380]   makes sense for individuals in their lives and how busy their kids need to be.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.140]   And what's actually a reasonable load of, of, of activities of
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.700]   volunteering to be on your plate.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.420]   How do we even define being a good citizen?
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.460]   How do we define being a good mother or father?
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.060]   How do we define being a good student?
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.460]   We need to catch up culturally.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.700]   And I don't think we have to break through forces trying to hold us back.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.940]   We just have to break through the inertia of this is difficult to do.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.340]   So who has some good solutions here?
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.900]   I think Oliver Berkman, his book, 4,000 weeks has caught a lot of attention.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.100]   I think he makes a really good case for how to change your own personal culture
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.340]   over how much work is a reasonable amount of work as an individual to take on.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.300]   I think Greg McKeown with essentialism has a really good take on what it looks
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.820]   like in a workplace to begin to radically reduce the workloads.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.420]   Laura Vanderkam, I think does really good work, especially thinking about a workload
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.900]   at home, the self-imposed workload you do in your roles, for example, as a parent
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.540]   or a friend or a community member.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.540]   In addition to your work.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:25.020]   I think my new book coming out next year, slow productivity is
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.660]   trying to get at this as well.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.300]   These all have different solutions to this problem that I think Odell is
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.500]   correctly pointing out that we do have a broken relationship with time.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.980]   So I think our reappraisal of our relationship with time is probably
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.820]   one of the more interesting things going on right now, especially in work culture.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.220]   But also I think in our culture outside of work, I think the post-capitalist
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.140]   crowd is good at diagnosing this problem, but not necessarily great at solutions.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.900]   If anything, they're very worried about offering solutions because they're worried
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.180]   that someone will then say you're trying to profit off of the, you are one of the
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.980]   exploiters, so they've kind of him themselves in a box there.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.540]   They can point out the issues, but they joined the problem if they offer solutions.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.500]   I do, however, think there is a growing chorus of us out there looking for more,
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.100]   a more human and humane relationship to workload, work, and time.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.580]   So read Jenny's book when it comes out, read Oliver's book, read Laura's books,
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.020]   read my new book when it's out.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.940]   I think a lot of interesting change is in the air.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.620]   What I've learned Jesse is I think I just need more interesting glasses.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.940]   I was just going to ask you that because you made the
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.780]   comment about complicated glasses.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:39.420]   If you're in Brooklyn or San Francisco, sort of doing kind of art base, mixing
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.500]   art with a sort of like neo-Marxist type critique of labor forces, you
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.980]   have to wear complicated glasses.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.700]   So they can be like completely round is like a big one, like
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.180]   completely round and thick framed.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.620]   Or like Seth Godin has these good ones as a, as a man, you can wear these big,
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.620]   thick plastic frame glasses that are like an interesting color.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.780]   Yellow.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.380]   Uh, that was my note.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.220]   I was going to bring that up.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.300]   Complicated glasses.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.820]   I need more complicated glasses.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.420]   Then I can start talking about exploitative labor forces.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.820]   I mean, whatever.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.180]   And again, Odell actually comes by this honestly.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.540]   It's just an actual academic.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.700]   There's other people whose names I won't mention who I think are just borrowing
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.860]   this lingo because it gives them this like world weary resigned era
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.380]   sophistication and it seems frustrating.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.580]   All right.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.420]   Wait, so we have some questions from you.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:32.660]   My listeners about this general topic of our broken relationship with time.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.500]   Um, first I want to mention one of the sponsors, however, that
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.700]   makes this show possible.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.900]   And that is our friends at 80,000 hours.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.020]   So we just talked about Oliver Berkman's 4,000 weeks.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.260]   Let's throw another number at you.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.300]   80,000 hours.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.660]   Where does this number come from?
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.660]   It is roughly the number of hours you will work in your career.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:58.340]   40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, 40 years, multiply those.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.380]   You get the 80,000 hours.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.060]   Now this is important, especially if you were thinking about how to have a
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.740]   positive impact on the world, because the time you spend in your career.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.940]   Is the highest energy, one of the largest chunks of time you're gonna
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.260]   spend on anything in your life.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.180]   So your job is probably the best tool you have to try to make a
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.380]   positive impact on the world.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.380]   That's something I know because I've written a whole book about trying to
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.260]   make your way through the complicated path of figuring out your career.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.260]   It can be really hard.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.140]   If not quite frankly, pretty stressful to try to figure out what
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.180]   do I want to do with my life?
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.620]   This is where 80,000 hours enters the scene.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.220]   It is a nonprofit co-founded by Will McCaskill, who is a philosopher
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:51.780]   at Oxford, it is a nonprofit that provides free research and support to
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.060]   help you find a career path for tackling one of the world's most pressing problems.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.140]   So McCaskill has a connection to the effect of altruism movement.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.820]   He sort of helped create it.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:04.420]   So he definitely has a mindset of where can you get the most bang for your
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.900]   buck in terms of getting positive change in the world.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.820]   And so it's one of the reasons why he helped found this nonprofit organization.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.060]   If we can help individuals find careers that are meaningful to the world, each
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.660]   of those individuals will then generate 80,000 hours of meaningful work.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.060]   Oh, and by the way, that individual is going to have a more meaningful life.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:26.020]   So this is a high leverage idea for improving the world.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.500]   So this is 80,000 hours.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.580]   So if you're looking to make a big change to the direction of your career, so maybe
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.780]   your mid career, or if you're just starting out, or if you want to just change what
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:43.660]   you're doing in your current job to better address global problems, 80,000 hours can help.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.900]   There's a couple of ways they can.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.540]   You can join their free newsletter and they will send you an in-depth guide.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.700]   They'll help you identify what problems are pressing and where you can
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.820]   have the biggest personal impact.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.500]   They also have a job board where you can find hundreds of opportunities listed

[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.620]   global pressing global problems.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.460]   Episode 94 with our good friend Ezra Klein is a particularly good one.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.100]   He's always a very careful thinker.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:27.940]   And that's all at 80,000 hours.org/deep.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.780]   Let's see if I get these number of zeros, right, Jesse.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:38.820]   8-0-0-0-0-0-4 zeros.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.020]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.580]   8-0-0-0-0-hours.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.020]   H-O-U-R-S.org/deep.

[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.180]   to help make the world a better place.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.380]   I also want to briefly mention our good friends at Hinson shaving.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.820]   The razor I use the razor I recommend.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.220]   I like these guys because they're fellow nerds.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.180]   This company actually originally, and to this day, works on precision
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.060]   manufacturing of parts for the aerospace industry.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.700]   I'm talking about parts on the Mars rover parts on the international space station.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.940]   And in order to build these precision parts, they have incredibly precise machinery.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.100]   They're high precision CNC routers.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.300]   Well, they realized they could use the same machinery that they use to make
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   these high precision space age parts to build a shaving razor that gives you a
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.260]   much better shave than anything on the market.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.100]   So it is a beautifully constructed aluminum.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.700]   Razor.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:48.300]   You put a standard 10 cent safety razor blade into this razor.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.020]   You screw it in.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.620]   And because of the precision manufacturing, you have just a hair
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.740]   breadth width of blade sticking out on either side of the housing.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.980]   Now, this is the key to getting a good shave.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.380]   You obviously need some blades sticking out the scrape the, the hair, but if
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.180]   it's too much blade sticking out, you get the diving board effect.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.420]   It goes up and down that gives you nicks.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.860]   That's more likely to get clogged.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.900]   So they use their precision manufacturing to build a razor that only needs a single
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.260]   10 cent blade to give you a great shave.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.660]   So you pay a little bit more up front to buy this beautifully
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.980]   engineered aluminum razor.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.500]   But then year after year, you're just spending a dime.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:23.820]   On the blades.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:29.820]   It does not take long until the cost of your Hinson razor is much cheaper than
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.220]   it would have cost if you were continually buying the new disposables
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.660]   at the pharmacy or getting the subscription boxes sent to you.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.060]   So I love really well-made things that does a job well and
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.940]   over time saves money.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.500]   And that is Hinson.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.140]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and those expensive drug store razors
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.740]   and say yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.700]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use the code CAL and
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.020]   you'll get two years of blades free with your razor.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.740]   Just make sure you add those two years worth of blades to your cart.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.700]   Type in that promo code CAL when you check out and that price will go down to zero.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:14.980]   That's 100 free blades when you head to H E N S O N S H A V I N G.com/cal
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.340]   and use the code CAL.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.700]   All right, Jesse, I resisted the urge to continue my trend of increasingly
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.540]   outlandish stories about people making their way towards me to compliment my shave.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.180]   I figured that was going to get, that was going to get worse before it got better.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.660]   We're going to be doing 20 minute action sequences.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.500]   So I pulled back.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.700]   I pulled back.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.820]   Let's just say it's a good shave.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.100]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.860]   What do we got?
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.740]   All right.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.260]   First question from Sam.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.660]   There's a time management popular app that insists that people should automate their
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.260]   time, time blocking using AI driven apps.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.180]   They think that it's too hard for people to manually replan and prioritize work.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.700]   What's your response?
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.780]   Negative.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:07.060]   I do not believe we need AI driven time blocking because we have to shave off the
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:14.140]   moments required to figure out what should be on our plan or to fix our plan when it
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.580]   actually drifts away.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:22.500]   Now, Silicon Valley is desperate for knowledge worker productivity, which is
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.820]   this sort of trillion dollar a year business opportunity to be something that
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.140]   can only be fixed by proprietary high-tech tools that only they know how to make.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.380]   There's huge money on the table there.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:37.420]   The unfortunate reality for Silicon Valley, however, is that this is not an
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.900]   issue that needs complicated high technology to solve.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.460]   Now there's a, there's a backstory here.
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.420]   This is a theory I have.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.060]   I'll share it with you.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   It's my theory about how Silicon Valley accidentally polluted our understanding
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   of productivity in a way that I think was, was very detrimental that we're only sort
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.180]   of pulling our way out of now in the last few years.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.780]   Here's what I think happened in the early 19 or in the early nineties, in the 1990s,
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.580]   let's say in the 1990s, that whole decade when Silicon Valley was exploding into
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:12.820]   prominence and into its sort of economic relevance, this was the same time when the
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.860]   computer processor wars were unfolding.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.700]   So you remember this, this March from the 286 to the 386 to the 486 to the Pentium,
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.380]   you actually knew how many megahertz your processor was.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.380]   And this processor has more megahertz than that processor.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.980]   So there's this age of the processor war during that age, as Silicon Valley was
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:39.380]   coming to cultural relevance and economic relevance, I believe they adopted
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.420]   implicitly this computer processor metaphor for understanding human productivity.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.740]   So when you're, when you're trying to make your computer processor better, what
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.060]   does it mean for a computer processor to be more productive?
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:56.900]   It goes through instructions faster, as fast as possible.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:02.420]   Let's reduce the time and friction in between each next instruction that we execute.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.340]   The other key component to making a computer processor very productive was to make
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.500]   sure that it always has something to do.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.020]   And so there's a technology called predictive pipelining, where essentially
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.780]   what would happen is you're, you're looking ahead to try to queue up instructions
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.900]   you think are going to come next, because you don't want there to be too much
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.380]   downtime after the processor completes the instruction to go figure out what it
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.020]   should do next.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.220]   That's all cycles that could have been doing something productive.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.100]   So there's this mindset of you want to queue always full of things to do.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.700]   So it always has something to pull in so that it's always executing something and
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.420]   every single cycle is executing something.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.700]   We want the speed between those cycles to be as fast as possible.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.660]   That's productivity for a computer processor.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.780]   Silicon Valley adopted a similar model for their human employees.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:52.460]   The notion of human productivity that was built around, how do we reduce the friction
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.180]   and time in between actual tasks or things being completed?
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.620]   So the focus went into how do we make networks faster?
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.740]   How do we make email more seamless?
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.140]   So you can get to the thing quicker, fewer keystrokes to send that email and have
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.420]   another one come in.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.620]   How can we build information management systems to make sure that every bit of
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.180]   information you need is right there at your fingertips?
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.340]   The notion of computer inboxes, email inboxes overflowing was not an issue because
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.300]   like a predictive pipeline, you would want more than enough stuff always ready to go
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.340]   so that that human always has something they can do, an email they can respond to,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.620]   something they can attach, something they can drag over into this program and then
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.660]   send that through email to that program that gets loaded here and it gets put on
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.740]   the screen and people can see it.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.740]   It's all about reducing friction, increasing the velocity of information,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.340]   increasing the velocity of task execution.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.060]   It's a very computer processor type metaphor.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.820]   And because Silicon Valley became so powerful and economically relevant in the
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.900]   1990s, what they were doing spread.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.300]   And we know that happens.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:57.220]   I think that the clearest example of Silicon Valley nonsense spreading nationwide,
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.980]   the one that we all know is open offices.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.860]   Silicon Valley started doing these open office plans because in their highly
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:08.660]   rarefied world, it really mattered to them that they could signal the potential
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.860]   employees and potential investors that they were disruptive and they were doing
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.900]   business in a new way.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.980]   It didn't really matter how they signaled this.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.220]   They just had the signal that they were disruptive because they would get better
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.540]   talent and they would get more investment.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.940]   And that was critical to their survival.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.420]   I mean, they could have done almost anything here.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.700]   They could have all worn weird, silly hats, whatever, but they just had the
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.940]   signal like we're being disruptive.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.700]   And then you fast forward 10 years later and, you know, I gave a talk at a major
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.100]   drug manufacturing a few years ago, and they were all shaking their heads about
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.260]   their giant open office.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.060]   It made no sense why they had open office, right?
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.620]   So stuff comes out of Silicon Valley.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.140]   So I think this notion of productivity as computer processor style, picking up the
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:49.020]   speed and reducing the friction required to execute small things that just spread.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:54.460]   And work and productivity in the knowledge sector became, are we on it?
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.020]   Are we quick?
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.620]   Are you here?
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.380]   Are you responding?
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.900]   Email's not fast enough.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.700]   Let's do Slack.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.260]   Let's do meetings and video because we can get onto those faster.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   How about you just directly have access to my calendar and can just start
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.060]   throwing things on there.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.060]   So it's a speed.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:13.140]   Now, of course, this didn't work at all because human beings are not computer
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:13.820]   processors.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.620]   We can only focus on one thing at a time.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.820]   It takes us a while to actually get going on something.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.100]   And once we're done with something, we need time to wind that back down to rest
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:26.020]   and recharge and then move our mind into a new context to work on something else.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.580]   I think there's probably like four different things we could productively
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.700]   give time to in a typical eight hour day with sufficient rest.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.780]   Our brain can't jump back and forth like a computer processor.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.620]   It's not agnostic to op codes.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:40.180]   The thing we just operated makes a big difference on the thing that comes next.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:45.420]   We're not just circuits being driven by a crystal oscillator at a constant speed.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.260]   So this computer processor notion of productivity, I think was devastating.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.500]   It's a lot of the exhaustion that people like we talked about earlier in the show,
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:46:00.540]   Ginny Odell, Berkman, McEwen, me, we're picking up on the exhaustion of this
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.940]   overload, this overload is in part a direct effect of this broken model of
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:10.180]   productivity that, again, it's not it's not mustache twirling exploit exploitation.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.500]   It's hey, the cool kids are doing this.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:18.260]   Jim Clark just built this giant Hyperion yacht.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.820]   If you don't know what I'm talking about, read Michael Lewis's book, The New New
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.420]   Thing, about the excesses of Silicon Valley in the 1990s.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.380]   They say, so whatever they're doing must make sense.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.300]   Let's be more like them.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.060]   And they built the tools that we used.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.420]   We use their tools.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.980]   We tried to emulate how they work.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.220]   That's what I think is broken.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.300]   And so, no, we're not going to fix our way out of this by making those tools faster.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:46.900]   Using AI to manage our time block schedule is perpetuating the computer
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.220]   processor metaphor of increasing speed and reducing friction of task
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.620]   executions to key to productivity.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.260]   That's an entirely broken metaphor.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.020]   Our issue is not that it takes us too much time to build our plan or that it
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.300]   takes us too much time to change our plan.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.100]   The issue is that we have 5x too many things in that plan.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.340]   It takes me five minutes to really think through how to build my plan.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.580]   It takes me three minutes to fix it.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.700]   That's not the problem.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.380]   The problem is checking the inbox once every one minute.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.140]   The problem is having seven meetings per day where you're trying to scramble in
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.460]   between these meetings to try to answer Slack messages.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.940]   That's where the real problem is.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.420]   And the problem for Silicon Valley is that the solutions to that problem have
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.540]   more to do with getting away from their ideas and getting away from their tools
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.700]   than they do about embracing even more.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:35.060]   So, nope, I'm not a big believer in an AI driven time blocking app.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.420]   I think my paper planner probably works just fine.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.940]   Not that I have a rant or anything, Jesse.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.140]   That was a good rant.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:44.220]   Not that I'm, not that I've thought about that.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.060]   Just a couple of thoughts.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:46.900]   All right, let's keep rolling here.
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:47.580]   What do we got next?
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:48.540]   Okay.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:53.140]   Next question's from Amit, a 27 year old PhD student.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.820]   Is slow productivity a good approach for getting world-class performance in
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.540]   competitive fields, such as being a top professor or chess player?
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.140]   Well, I mean, let's think about this, Amit.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.980]   I mean, I get your concern is, and I'm going to reword your question, but your
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.860]   concern is, wait, slow productivity means I can't be world-class.
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:11.780]   Well, let's think through.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:17.860]   World-class performers, world-class mathematician, world-class chess player.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.900]   What do they have to do to get there?
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:25.300]   Number one, they tend to focus on a very small number of things.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:30.020]   For really world-class people, they typically focus to the almost pathological
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.900]   exclusion of anything else in their life.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:38.900]   They are returning to it again and again, uh, with busy periods where they're
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.780]   really locked in and periods of recovery.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.820]   So there's this sort of these seasonal uneven rhythms to how that work goes.
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.820]   Um, and they're obsessed with getting better and better, increasing
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.020]   the quality of what they do.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.300]   I mean, those are basically reworded versions of the three
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.660]   principles of slow productivity.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.900]   Do fewer things, working at a natural pace, obsessing over quality.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:04.980]   The people who are best at what they do in the world are slow
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:05.980]   productivity enthusiasts.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.980]   They just don't know that term.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.900]   And I think what's happening here is there's a semantic shift where you,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:17.340]   where you, you're thinking about slow as slowing down your progress and fast as
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.940]   being moving quicker towards your goals.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.260]   And you have that exactly backwards.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.460]   Fast productivity is defined by frenetic busyness, more
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.100]   things switching more often.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:34.860]   You will produce less work and make less progress at the higher levels of quality
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.220]   in a fast productivity environment than in a slow productivity environment,
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.740]   which means stick to fewer things.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.100]   Really obsessed over doing those things.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.540]   Well, allow your pace to move up and down as dictated by your natural rhythm.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.380]   So slow productivity is basically the only way towards world class performance.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.740]   They've already figured that out.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.060]   The argument in the book I'm writing now is that we need to bring those
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:59.260]   ideas to more people and more context, not just for the Magnus Carlson's of the
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:05.620]   world, but for the vice director of HR, for the computer developer, for the
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:09.540]   person who works in marketing, copywriting, trying to take this idea that we already
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.780]   know in these rarefied fields and make it more generally applicable.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:17.180]   All right, let's keep rolling, Jesse.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.260]   All right.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.740]   Next question is from Joseph.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.260]   Dear Cal and Jesse, here's my question for you both.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.220]   When it comes to constructing a deep life, what are you most
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.540]   proud of having accomplished?
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.820]   Where do you still find yourselves struggling?
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:35.020]   You know, Jesse, is that one catch you off guard or do you have, do you have a thought?
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.100]   They want to know.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.740]   I have a thought.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.980]   Well, it doesn't really catch me off guard because I saw the
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.180]   question when I was prepping the show.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.700]   You're not supposed to tell them that.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.180]   You're supposed to say, oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.500]   Well, off the top of my head.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.340]   And then you put on your reading glasses and start.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.260]   Put on my complicated glasses.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.900]   Put on your complicated glasses and start talking about the exploitative
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.540]   mechanics of labor alienation.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.420]   All right.
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.660]   What, so what's your answer, Jesse?
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:04.420]   Um, I think I do a decent job of, you know, balance, you know, I'd have work
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:11.460]   and then I coach and, um, got my personal life and then I work out too.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.860]   So I do that, you know, pretty much every day.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.300]   So I'm happy with that in some regards.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.620]   Sometimes, you know, working out and stuff does take a lot of time and then
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.260]   that limits some other things, but I kind of just look at what you've been talking
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.340]   about and just take the slow approach for that type of stuff.
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.940]   I mean, I would say that about you.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.260]   I would say you're, you're very intentional in lifestyle design.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.020]   I think you're right.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.620]   Like, I mean, you kind of have it figured out.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.340]   I think you're good at noting like, this is important to me.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:47.780]   Like the, like the social, the social aspect of my life is important to me.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.700]   And this physical aspect is important to me.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.740]   And you, you figure out configurations and then you, uh, tweak
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.580]   the configurations as needed.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.820]   Um, and you know what, what I like about your story, by the way, is, you know,
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:01.380]   I talk a lot about when you work backwards from the vision of the lifestyle and
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.940]   then figure out, Oh, like, what are my ways to it, you end up sometimes with
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.860]   interesting approaches that you wouldn't come across if you were just starting
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.020]   from going the other direction and just be like, Oh, what should I do?
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:15.900]   Um, when you're instead trying to solve for a cool or complicated lifestyle
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.740]   picture, you end up innovating more.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.900]   And so I think for example, like you figuring out about the, the country club.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:26.180]   That was working backward because it solves a bunch of things for you.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.300]   It gives you different types of outdoor sports and social connection
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:36.700]   different people, um, golf and tennis, and you can practice and know people and be
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.060]   involved in the clubhouse and all these types of things, but you probably, you
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.620]   would never have gotten there if you were just doing the normal thing of just working
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.260]   forward from what do I want to do with my time?
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.940]   Because typically a country club, you might think it's, it's, you know, uh, upper
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.060]   middle-aged lawyers that are networking on the golf course or something like that.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.140]   But you realize like, actually there's a way to make this reasonable.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.700]   There's a way, you know, anyways, I think that's like an example of.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.540]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.300]   There's also really cool places to read at like country clubs.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.100]   There's like different places you can sit and stuff.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.660]   I know you like that.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.340]   I think I would like that.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.420]   The problem is I don't like golf or tennis.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.460]   I wasn't saying that.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.860]   I was, I was saying you'd like, no, but I, I, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   I've always, I always noted that I always enjoyed that in curb your enthusiasm.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.220]   I was like, you know, Larry gets a lot of value out of the club because they have
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.780]   lunch there, like they do other things.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.140]   Um, that's very, that's very intentional.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:26.860]   The, the, here's my observation about this is if I just am looking at my
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:32.380]   professional life and you know, the deep aspects of my professional life, the list
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:36.900]   of things are like, yeah, this is, um, you know, I'm proud of this is very deep and
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.500]   important.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.180]   It's not super long.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.100]   I mean, it's my books.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.060]   There's a subset of my academic and public facing articles.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.540]   And I'm very proud of, they're hard to predict in advance, but like, this was a
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.500]   really great mathematical idea that did not exist in the world.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.140]   And now it does.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.700]   And it's beautiful.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.220]   I like it.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.180]   Or, you know, this article I think hit a nerve and it's like helping the culture
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.420]   understand some particular thing that's going on.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.900]   Um, you know, I'm, I'm proud of that.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.460]   And then the individual case studies of either students at Georgetown's or readers
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.700]   of mine, I meet who've actually made significant changes to their life because
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.260]   of in part interactions we've had on my information.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:11.980]   I'm very proud of that.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:18.220]   Uh, and yet I would say most of my activity on most days doesn't directly
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.020]   actually feed to one of those three types of things.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.060]   And I think that's interesting.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:27.340]   And I think that's just a reality of the inevitable creeping busyness of
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.980]   modernity or something like this.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.940]   But, but it's, it's, I was just noticing that when I was thinking about this
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.860]   question earlier today, that I might go through a whole day where, you know,
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.580]   I'm like, I did so much activity today.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:43.100]   And so little of it was actually just trying to write that book or article
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.700]   that's going to change someone's mind or just spending some time with
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.820]   someone whose life was changed.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:52.220]   It's no, it's, it's, you know, I'm working on a teaching statement for a
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.860]   promotion packet that probably is not going to be read or I'm in the weeds on
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:02.220]   technical issues of the website migration as we move to a different, uh, as we move
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.740]   to a different provider, then the email whitelist is not quite working right.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.140]   Or getting on zooms to talk about whatever.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.660]   And anyways, I don't know.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.660]   I got reflective, Jesse.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.460]   Ferris had a recent episode about this too.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.780]   And he was kinda, he had a coach on and they were like going through this same
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:17.940]   sort of thing that you were talking about.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.180]   And which episode, I need to listen to this.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.020]   Which episode was this?
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.100]   It was the one right before, right after Mobison.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.780]   It was like two ago or one ago.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.260]   Okay.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:25.820]   All right.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.500]   I'm going to look that, I'm going to look that up.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:31.820]   I, I, I don't want to give, this was a, I won't give identifying details here.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.660]   Cause this was not an email for public consumption, though.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.220]   This is someone maybe we're going to have to have on the show
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.420]   later when our book comes out.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.340]   But I was talking to someone who had crossed paths with us.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:45.100]   We were both at MIT at the same time doing our PhDs, different fields.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:50.420]   Um, and then she has a new book coming out, which, um, I'm sure we'll cover on
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.020]   the show, a really cool book idea.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.660]   Uh, but I was talking to her and she went a different way than me.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:02.540]   She moved to an Island, like a remote Island off of the Pacific Northwest
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.580]   coast, uh, rebuild a cabin and to just.
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.940]   She was doing consulting work.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.780]   It was, you know, using her MIT brain, but wanted to counterbalance that with,
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:17.300]   uh, the physicality of trying to refurbish and bring back a cabin and
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.420]   kind of live in the middle of nowhere.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.700]   And she has this very cool book coming out.
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:20.380]   I mean, I haven't read it yet.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.100]   She's sending me a copy, but it's one of these ideas where I'm thinking like,
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.140]   man, that's like right up my alley.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.900]   But I was thinking kind of cold up there.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.100]   Right.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.940]   It's probably cold and wet, but still I'm just thinking like, I bet
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.060]   she's incredibly less busy than I am.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.060]   And so it's, you know, a different.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.420]   Uh, a fork in the road, Dante, right.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.620]   You go different ways with this.
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.980]   Like we, we started from the same place.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.340]   Like, oh, we've got these technical brains that, you know, we
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.980]   have a few abilities and can.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.700]   Well, you also have three young kids.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:47.780]   I don't, that's true.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.780]   That's like a huge thing.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.860]   But think about it.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.100]   They could be repairing my cabin in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.620]   If, if, if I had gone that route anyway, so I'm going to have her, I'm going to read
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.500]   her book and maybe when that book comes out, I'll have her on and we can talk.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:56:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.220]   That'd be cool.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.180]   Talk about our two, uh, varying paths.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.380]   Um, and I should warn everyone though.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.420]   I was talking to my coach about this the other day, March and April.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:12.260]   Every year are my worst months.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:16.780]   It's, it's just some quirk of the academic calendar and whatever.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.500]   It's always my, they're always super busy.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.740]   And always during this period, I go through a phase of just like,
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.660]   I should live on a damn Island.
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.740]   I have too much.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.540]   This is crazy.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.340]   This, this I've too much going on and what am I doing?
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.660]   And then usually by June, I'm like, what an awesome life.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.300]   Like, look at this like cool academic job.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.660]   I could just like think all summer and this is so cool.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.820]   And I love being around the students.
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.020]   But in March and April, I'm always so close to, you know, I need
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.580]   to go become a wood carver every year.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.140]   My coach pointed this out every year.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.900]   I think everybody in some capacity has.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.660]   Has their time of year.
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.260]   Has those sort of feelings of, you know, like one thing I always think about
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.340]   too is like, yeah, I'm always running out of time and I don't, I could
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.460]   have done something longer, but then I do like the shutdown, like you talk
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:05.180]   about and just be like, I'll do it tomorrow as long as I like worked
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:06.140]   out and did some other things.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:06.460]   That's fine.
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.380]   I'm doing the worst type of work right now.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.020]   No, you only have to do this a couple of times in your career, but I'm
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:14.780]   working on a statements for a promotion package at Georgetown.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.780]   You have like research statement, teaching statements.
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:20.260]   I don't know why it is, but this type of writing, like a research statement,
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.260]   let me explain like what I've been doing as a researcher, it takes
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.460]   me all the time in the world.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:26.940]   I do a lot of writing.
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.500]   Like I'm a, I'm a, I'm a adept writer that writes, I wear
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.740]   away the keys on my keyboard.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:36.860]   I finished, it took me seven days of making it mainly the only thing I was
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.220]   working on to write this 11 page research statement, it's, it just
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.260]   takes all of my time.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:43.260]   I don't know why this type of writing does.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.180]   It just really does.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:44.860]   And it's exhausting.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.060]   That's why I'm exhausted right now.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.380]   And it's just a two week period where I'm writing these things
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.140]   and I'll be done with it.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.260]   But I'm writing books, writing New Yorker pieces, writing academic papers.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.220]   No problem compared.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.780]   I don't know what it is about this specific type of writing,
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.100]   but it just takes me forever.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:01.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:02.620]   I hate it.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:04.580]   I can't wait.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.420]   I can't wait to do something easy, like return to my like incredibly technical
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:11.900]   6,000 word New Yorker piece that we're editing right now, where we have to like
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.820]   fact check everything with another, with computer scientists, walk in the park.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.820]   Compared to like talking, yeah.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:21.220]   Compared to talking about the courses I developed.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.500]   I don't know why that writing gets to me.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.220]   It's like this weird block I have.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:28.700]   Um, well, in a way it's kind of like bureaucracy, like, you know, setting up
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.220]   yourself.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:29.780]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.340]   I don't like talking about myself.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.940]   It's it's, and yet it's super precise and it's like a lot of citations and
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.980]   you have to be very careful.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.140]   And when I say 11 pages, it's 11 pages, but it's like, it's small font and, and,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.900]   and single spaced and it's, you know, it's, it's a lot of words.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.540]   All right.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.340]   Let me do one more thing here.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.260]   I have a case study before we go to the something interesting.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.740]   I wanted to share a case study here.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:54.580]   This was sent in by Marcus, a 32 year old composer from Detroit.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.580]   So here's what Marcus sent me.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:59.820]   I am a musician and composer living in Detroit, Michigan.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.460]   In May of 2022, I was asked to write a large work for a seven piece ensemble.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:10.540]   I took your advice of doing less at a higher quality, and I gave them a quote
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:15.060]   that reflected what it would cost for me to solely work on the composition and
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.780]   not take on any other work, no performances, no private students, no other
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.100]   commissions, um, for three months.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.660]   My promise to them was that I was, I would not take on any other projects in
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.300]   that time that I was working on the composition and that by doing this, I
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:32.860]   would deliver something of very high quality, they agreed, and I got the work.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.820]   A week after I agreed to this, my father who was put in hospice from a major
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.420]   stroke was put in the hospice for a major stroke.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.460]   It was devastating and it made it very hard to stay motivated to do anything.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:46.980]   Fortunately, I had been practicing some of the things out of your book, Deep Work,
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.300]   and I applied it to this composition.
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:54.140]   I knew from previous projects that I can get everything I need done in two to
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.740]   four hours of non-distracted work.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.260]   So I would wake up early in the morning and work for two hours and then some days
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.300]   knock out another two hours in the early afternoon, and I would do this five days
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.740]   a week, this allowed me to spend the afternoons and evenings with my father
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.500]   and his final days, the things I learned from your podcast and books, not only
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   helped me compose one of my greatest works yet, it also allowed me to spend as
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.260]   much time as I could with my father and his final days for that I am forever
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:18.980]   grateful.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:24.420]   Well, you know what I love about this, Marcus, is it's a, it's a case study of
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.700]   slow productivity that gets at, I think the human core of this philosophy that
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:35.260]   this notion of slow productivity, as opposed to fast productivity allows for
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:41.180]   a world in which you produce great things that you're proud of, like this work that
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.780]   you produce, the seven piece on composition for seven piece ensemble that you
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.220]   described as one of your greatest works you've ever composed, while at the same
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:54.540]   time, having a life that is rich and present in all the other things that are
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.260]   key to the human experience, that in the same time that you could have this very
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:05.180]   difficult, but touching final weeks with your father, also, we're still producing
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.940]   something of great value.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:10.940]   Now extrapolate this forward to other people in all sorts of situations.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.300]   That's time that would be maybe your relationship with your kids, time that
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.900]   you're getting involved with your community, time in which you are going
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:26.020]   on a spiritual journey, imagine having the ability, not when you're on vacation,
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.580]   not during a sabbatical or during a brief break in between jobs, but at all
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:36.460]   points, to be able to be investing such richness into what makes humanity and
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.140]   the human experience so complicated and special and interesting, at the same
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.260]   time that you're also producing stuff of great value to yourself and to the world.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.380]   I think that's the promise of slow productivity.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:51.060]   And my hope is the principles will be able to spread beyond specific, highly
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.420]   autonomous fields, like I'm a music composer and into other fields as well.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:00.980]   I think much more work could have this rich mix of the "productive" and the
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.660]   human, it's just a matter of rethinking productivity.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.860]   So that's a great case study, Marcus, and it's a very moving story.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.940]   And I'm glad you shared that with me.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.940]   Yeah, it's really powerful stuff because you've been talking about it for a long
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.100]   time since you started your podcast, but identifying the beginning of the week
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:19.620]   where, you know, he was going to need those two hour blocks, he found it, did
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.460]   it, non-distracted work and did the stuff.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:26.300]   I mean, the same thing applies, you know, I took your advice, you know,
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.180]   for a while too, and it works.
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.460]   I mean, I get the sense that for most people in most jobs, two hours every
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:36.540]   morning, occasionally another two hour block in the afternoon, five days a week.
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:40.300]   That's 80% of like everything important you do.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.780]   Everything else is overhead.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.780]   Overhead and overload and make work.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.340]   I think that's most jobs.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.380]   I think you're right.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.540]   I mean, you could take, well, don't get me started.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.260]   I could rant about almost any field.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.460]   So my book has to come out.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.700]   Books take too long, Jesse.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.980]   You know, we're editing my book now.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.460]   It's going to be next March before this beast comes out.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.220]   It feels like it's too long from now.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.980]   Another stressful period next March.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.340]   Uh-oh.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.020]   Oh yeah, I know.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:09.660]   That's right.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.180]   I'll be doing book publicity during the part of my year.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.340]   That's the most, I guess I'll write those things for seven days.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.860]   I'm going to become a street musician next March.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.540]   I'm going to surf.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.460]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:27.860]   I'm going to move the, I'm going to move to the North shore of Maui
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.700]   and just become a surfer.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.460]   It's just going to break me.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460]   All right.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.300]   I got something interesting.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:36.500]   I want to share also about the academic world, also about time and overload.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.540]   But first I want to briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.660]   It's our friends at Huel, H U E L.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:47.660]   Huel, a black edition is a high protein, nutritionally complete
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.460]   meal and a convenient shake.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:53.100]   This means it has everything your body needs in two scoops, including 27
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.660]   essential vitamins and minerals, not to forget also 40 grams of protein.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.380]   Each scoop has 200 calories.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.340]   So you do two scoops.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.660]   That's a normal size, 400 calorie meal.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:08.460]   The way I use Huel, and I've talked to this on the show before, is that my
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:14.980]   incredibly sophisticated, healthy eating strategy is automate breakfast and lunch.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.260]   Don't think about it.
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:19.180]   This is just what I do for breakfast and lunch and make whatever those automatic
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.620]   things are, be things that are good and healthy for you, and then let dinner be
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.180]   something where you get more involved in, Hey, what are we cooking?
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:25.820]   And it's interesting.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.420]   And you can really appreciate food.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.340]   That's my hack.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.100]   And one of the best ways to automate it is like when I'm at
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:32.820]   Georgetown, for example, for lunch.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.900]   I know there's a, a cafeteria right next to my building.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.020]   It has a hot bar at a cold bar and it's it's I fill the thing.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.140]   Two thirds, vegetables, one third protein.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.660]   And then I throw a bunch of olives in there and I get a big thing of water.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.780]   I just know that's what I do for lunch.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.660]   I don't even think about it.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.540]   I do it.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.740]   I know exactly when I go there.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.060]   I don't even want to think about lunch for breakfast.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.500]   I put in these meal replacement shakes as a regular option.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.620]   So some days I have eggs.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.580]   Some days I have these.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.220]   It's all about automation, reduced to friction.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.140]   So you don't have to think about food during parts of the day.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.500]   And now you've taken care of whatever two thirds of your calories
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.500]   are giving you what you need.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.420]   And then you can still enjoy food and preparation and
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.620]   ingredients and all that stuff.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.860]   And you can just enjoy it in dinner.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:18.580]   So Huel is a big part of my automation approach to staying healthy.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.500]   When I have so much else going on, I don't want to spend too
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.460]   much time thinking about it.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.020]   Huel Black Edition is vegan, naturally gluten-free, lactose-free, has zero
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.300]   artificial sweeteners, naturally flavored, low GI, has omega-3s and
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:35.420]   omega-6, is GMO-free, palm oil-free, has D2 and D3 vitamins in vegan form,
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.220]   available in nine flavors.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.060]   It's also affordable.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.340]   Works out to be about $2.50 for each 400 calorie meal.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.180]   Hard to beat that at a restaurant.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.780]   So if you want to find out more, go to Huel.com/questions.

[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.180]   Also want to mention our friends at Stamps.com.

[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.820]   All right, Jesse, let's wrap up today's episode with something
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.420]   interesting. Sounds good.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.660]   So what I like to do here is go through my inbox at
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:34.420]   interesting@cowlnewport.com and pick something that I thought was
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.420]   interesting that you, my listeners have sent in.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.980]   So what I have to talk about here is an article from Nature.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.860]   So the journal Nature has these various career columns, which I think are
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.700]   actually quite interesting, especially for an academic.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.580]   Here's one that is from, let me look at it here.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.180]   It's on the screen, March 3rd.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.940]   So I have this up on the screen, youtube.com/cowlnewportmediaepisode239
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.220]   or thedeeplife.com.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.220]   Here's the title of the article.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:06.060]   Fed up and burnt out, quiet quitting hits academia.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.700]   Here's the subhead.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.660]   Many researchers dislike the term, but the practice of dialing back
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.980]   unrewarded duties is gaining traction.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:18.260]   I don't even need to scroll in this article.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:26.060]   I'm just going to riff right off of this sub head because the academics who are
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.300]   disliking the term are a hundred percent correct.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.460]   What this is talking about is not quiet quitting.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:39.660]   What this is talking about is the fact that in academia, there's something
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.060]   known as service obligations.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.620]   So these are things you do to help either your department or the
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.580]   university or your research community.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.380]   They're non-academic in the sense they're not research and they're not teaching.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.460]   So it's not the activities that you're directly paid or evaluated on for
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.500]   promotion, but it's, you need to give back for service, run committees
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.660]   and do reviews, et cetera.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:04.060]   There is no agreed upon standards for how you triage these type of requests.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.340]   There's no quotas of here's how many I do per year.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.900]   And here's where my quota is.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.580]   It's instead just all ad hoc psychological negotiation.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.540]   This person is asking you to do something.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.860]   Do you want to say no to this person?
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:21.140]   And it creates overload very easily because it's hard to say no to people.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:25.460]   It also creates personality based inequities where people who are weird,
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:32.300]   unshaven physicist who scrawl equations on windows, like John Nash from a beautiful
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:36.580]   mind, it's easy for them to be like me, no do committee, me math now.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.940]   And people like, oh, you know, he's, he's, he's unshaven and draws
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.780]   on the window and it's fine.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.500]   But if you're a nice social scientist, they're like, oh man, she's icy.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.100]   You see, she does not get along with people.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.700]   I just ask her if she would just sort of join this commission and spend 50 hours
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.740]   the next few weeks helping me work on this report that no one's going to read.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.580]   I don't know why she's not.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.340]   So it creates all sorts of weird, like personality based inequities.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:04.100]   Figuring out a sensical system for how you say yes or no to those.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.940]   What's a reasonable load is not quiet quitting.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.900]   It's actually doing your job.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.740]   It's reinserting into your job as an academic, what was already missing.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:19.020]   Saying yes, not dialing back on unrewarded duties is being bad at your job.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.500]   It means you're producing less research.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.460]   It means you're doing less time mentoring the next generation of researchers.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.460]   It means you're doing less time teaching the next generation of people in the
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.740]   classroom for expertise on this, not dialing back on these secondary
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.620]   duties means you're a bad professor.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:39.340]   So this idea that it's somehow quitting quiet, quitting to dial back, I think
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:42.260]   gets at our broken notions of productivity.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.500]   So I'm tying together everything we've been talking about in today's episode.
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.540]   It's only this sort of Silicon Valley commodified time.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.380]   More is better than less activity means usefulness.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.100]   Less activity means no low friction, high velocity information
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.060]   is somehow what's valuable.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.740]   It's only in that notion of productivity.
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:04.180]   Would you say doing less unrewarded activity in academia is somehow quiet quitting.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.100]   I see it to be the exact opposite.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:12.420]   Giving in to just the deluge of nonstop incoming service requests is a way to
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.380]   sort of let yourself off the intellectual hook for the work that really matters.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:18.260]   The work you train for the work that they hired you for.
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:21.100]   It is hard work to try to build those systems and push back.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.540]   But in some sense right now that's on the individual to do and it's our jobs.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.660]   And hopefully going forward, it won't just be our jobs.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.460]   We'll have organization wide recognitions and solutions for these problems.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.660]   But I just think this headline plus sub headline.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:39.260]   Three sentences neatly captures this issue we have, this misunderstanding
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.860]   we have about productivity.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.820]   Doing stuff is often irrelevant to doing your job well.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:51.020]   And so these academics who are dialing back are actually dialing up.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:57.580]   The core functions of their job and should be lauded for their extra effort, for their
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:02.820]   extra focus on being as useful as possible, not derided as quiet quitters.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.100]   So there we go.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.380]   Jesse, I tied it all together.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.620]   I think we kept our thread going about our broken relationship through time
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.420]   throughout the entire episode.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.860]   I'm now going to go work on my teaching statement some more until my eyeballs bleed.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.100]   I am miserable.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   I got to get out of March.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:19.980]   We're almost there.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   We're almost out of March when I can be happy again.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:23.300]   But I better get back to that.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:27.020]   So thank you everyone who sent in your questions.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.620]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.020]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   [outro music]
