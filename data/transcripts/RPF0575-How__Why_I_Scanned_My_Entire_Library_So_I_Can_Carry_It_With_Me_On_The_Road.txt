[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:57.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less. My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today we answer a listener question. The listener writes in and says, "Joshua, good evening. I've been listening for a while, and I remember that during one episode you briefly went into how you were scanning all of your books to PDF. I was wondering, will you please elaborate some more on that for me? Did you have a high-end duplex scanner? Or software specially made for the PDF?"

It takes so much time for an author to sit down and consider their thoughts and develop those thoughts and put them into a book that people don't generally do it casually. Only a handful of books are written quickly and published immediately. Rather, an author will generally labor and labor and labor for hard work.

[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:33.740]   think see,,, Ð¶Ð¸Ð·
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:20:14.960]  berger: So, the one that I have used, that I borrowed from somebody, was a fairly, was a, wasn't a high-end commercial one, but it was a, just a common desk type one that could do a couple hundred pages. And with most books, I could put in most books, most paperbacks, most hardback books, except for the very thickest of my textbooks, which I scanned all my textbooks as well. Then you could just slide them in there and you
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:21:12.600]   and then scan it for you. So, you have to cut up and destroy the books. I believe there are services that will do that for you. I believe you can ship the books off, and I would recommend that you consider it, because it's very time-intensive. If you can look at a service and they charge you a modest price, a couple bucks a book, something like that, it's probably worth it to go ahead and ship the books off and have somebody with commercial equipment do the destruction of the book and then scan it for you.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:37.400]   wait
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:48.880]   So that can make pretty quick work of a book.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.000]   You do have to sit there and feed it, but it'll scan 30 pages a minute automatically, and it'll create a PDF for you.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.780]   And if you've done a good job with your cutting of the book to eliminate binding, to eliminate adhesives, and to eliminate double pages, it's fairly trouble-free.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:09.200]   You learn over time that you need to cut off more than you'd like to because you want to make sure there's no binding or glue residue.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   You want to make sure that you're cutting off more than you'd like to because you want to make sure there's no binding or glue residue that's holding pages together because that just doesn't work.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   You want to make sure that you're cutting off more than you'd like to because you want to make sure there's no binding or glue residue that's holding pages together because that just doesn't work.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:37.500]  , but it's fairly trouble-free.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.500]   And so you can run it through with the scanner.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.600]   In hindsight, given the fact that if I didn't own or have access to the loan of a guillotine paper cutter, I might consider buying one of the more expensive scanners that is purpose-designed for scanning books.
