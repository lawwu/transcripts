[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - There we go.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.300]   Are you a fantasy guy, Jesse?
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.240]   - Yeah, yeah I am.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.640]   - Do you read fantasy books?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.760]   - I read a lot of science fiction right now.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.600]   - Oh, I see.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.940]   I feel like I should be more into fantasy.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.440]   And I've read some, like the classics,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.120]   but I think I should be a huge fantasy fan
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.040]   just given my demographics.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.800]   It's like a semi-nerdy, computer science,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000]   whatever, guy who reads a lot.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.400]   And I don't know, I lose steam.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.240]   But I've read the classics.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   I've done "The Lord of the Rings."
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.980]   I'm doing Ursula Gwynn's "Earthsea Cycle."
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160]   Oh, I'm reading at least the first one.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160]   Just why not?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.800]   I like "Name of the Wind."
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600]   So I like Brandon Sanderson's book.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.760]   I mean, man, it's long.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.100]   But I like that.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.480]   But I've tried a lot of other things that I've just,
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.320]   I don't know, I can't get in.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.800]   I tried Robert Jordan.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.440]   - How is "Lord of the Rings?"
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.400]   - I reread that again at some point, and it's cool.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.580]   It's written in a mythological meter,
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.640]   if that makes sense, right?
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.440]   So he writes it almost like you're reading,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.340]   because he's an expert in Old English,
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.160]   like it's mythological,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.080]   where now things are more boldly expository.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.400]   Like I'm the third-person observer
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.640]   just explaining everything that's happening.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.920]   But this had a more,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.600]   especially the first "Lord of the Rings" book,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.400]   I don't know, there's more of like a mythological,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.040]   than I remembered, meter to it.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.640]   The language is a little chewy.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.320]   It kind of sets the scene,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.920]   and it's not all just pure action,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.500]   and sometimes the description feels more mythological
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.920]   than modern, just objective description of what's happening.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   So it's a very impressive, very impressive book.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   - Did you like the movies?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.880]   - I kind of get bored in the movies.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.280]   I don't know, did you like them?
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.120]   - I did, yeah.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.040]   - Yeah.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.000]   I just, that's my memory.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.480]   I re-watched some of them recently.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.560]   It's my memory in the theater was getting a little,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.400]   a little antsy.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.240]   Here's my, okay, here's the "Lord of the Rings" question
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.440]   about the movies.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.900]   Because I don't know, no one else seems to agree with this.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.320]   But to me, and this is probably unavoidable
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.840]   because of budgets,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.600]   the world seems so uninhabited.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.440]   It's all just empty fields and mountains,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.600]   and then they'll eventually come to like a city with a king,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.840]   but it'll be 70 people in the middle,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.560]   like a giant empty field or this or that.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.960]   It just feels like there's no people in that world.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.680]   And so is that supposed to be because after ancient warfare,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   it's like largely depopulated
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.520]   or it's just a very sparsely populated country,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.040]   but nowhere in the "Lord of the Rings" universe,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.280]   in the visual movie universe,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.320]   you ever have this feel of like medieval England
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.880]   or something where there's big cities
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.980]   and villages and stuff.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.840]   It's just, everything is so empty.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.340]   Was it that way in the books?
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.000]   - I'm trying to remember.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.360]   I don't remember.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.280]   It's a good question.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.720]   I mean, I think the,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   I read a book about "Lord of the Rings."
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.160]   This part, a couple of years ago,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.360]   I read a book about the making of the movies.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.000]   That was actually kind of an interesting book.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.620]   Like what, everything that went through,
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.360]   like the movie rights and how Peter Jackson got them
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   and how they filmed it and where they found it.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   Like to me, that was actually more interesting.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   And I think the reality is like, they can't afford to,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.240]   you can't make medieval England.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.900]   It's just too many people.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.960]   So it's easier for it to be sparsely populated.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.800]   - Yeah.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.540]   - But let's add this to our list of directions
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.940]   for us not to go with this podcast.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.320]   Next two, we had from last week,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.480]   becoming like a hardcore sports talk radio show,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   but the premise is I know nothing about sports,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.960]   but I'm very enthusiastic about it.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.320]   And like Pat McAfee, we're a tank top and stand up and yell,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.880]   I know nothing about sports.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   And then two, let's not become a like hardcore fantasy
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.720]   discussion podcast.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.920]   This is gonna be a lot of like, I don't know.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   I didn't like it.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.480]   I didn't read it.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.320]   I don't know.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.040]   Those are on the list.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.160]   Our list is growing, Jesse.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.840]   Our list of things we should not try to discuss
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   on this show is growing, growing with each week.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.480]   Fantasy book reviews with Cal and Jesse.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.240]   Like, I don't know.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.320]   Seems kind of nerdy.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.840]   What's next?
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.960]   We out of here in like a crisp five minutes.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.560]   (upbeat music)
