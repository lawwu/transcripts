[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.100]   Everyone needs to put their hand up like this
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.660]   and pat themselves on the back.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.780]   Because you guys just showed up at 8 AM on a Sunday
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.700]   to watch a lawyer speak without a slide deck also.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.660]   So Mike, thank you for that introduction.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.260]   Everything out there says Jennifer Rosell.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.260]   I go by Jenny.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980]   You'll learn that I'm a pretty informal person.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.180]   And y'all just have to bear with me without my slideshow.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.780]   So like Mike said, I am an owner and attorney
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.060]   at Indiana State and Elder Law.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.900]   Do I have any Indiana folks in the room?
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.060]   Oh, like one, two?
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.180]   We're so close, guys.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.740]   Well, it's nice to see some Hoosiers in the audience.
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.620]   So as the firm name signals, all I do is estate and elder law.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.220]   So this is what I live and breathe every single day.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.060]   Also, as Mike mentioned, if you're a podcast person,
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.620]   I think podcasts are kind of a love-hate thing.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.220]   You either love them, or you're like,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.380]   I don't even know how to listen to them.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.220]   Please feel free to check out my podcast.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.500]   It's Legal Tea.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.740]   And I do a ton of different content,
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.860]   but my favorite ones are celebrity estate planning.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.220]   They are notoriously terrible at estate planning.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.020]   So if you kind of like that sort of stuff,
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.100]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.580]   So when I was preparing for this presentation,
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.140]   I really wanted to start with, what
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.140]   is that term estate planning even mean?
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.620]   Because I think that estate planning
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.260]   is kind of thrown around by different professionals,
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.020]   not wrongly.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.700]   But what I mean by that is there's
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.620]   plenty of attorneys that do estate planning.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.620]   Financial advisors will state that they do estate planning.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.260]   Tax professionals will state that they do estate planning.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.220]   My session today is from the lawyer's perspective.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.820]   All of us do estate planning, because what estate planning is
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.820]   is really managing your assets from a place of what
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.100]   your goals are, kind of join that with your family
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.980]   structure, and what your age is, the types of assets.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.140]   So all of these professionals do estate planning.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.780]   But this session today, like my joke at the beginning,
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.420]   is from the lawyer's perspective,
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.580]   which is really about the documents that support us
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.180]   in the event of incapacity or in the event of we pass away.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.780]   So not only did you guys show up to hear a lawyer talk
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620]   about estate planning, but now it's 8 AM lawyer
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.580]   and talking about incapacity and death.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.740]   So OK, so really getting to the meat and potatoes
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.660]   of this presentation.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.460]   So when I think of that term, estate planning,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.540]   there are four themes or things as part of estate planning
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.420]   that I consider the core four.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.020]   And I'm going to go through each one of them
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.380]   kind of thoroughly and strategically.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.100]   So oh, you're playing with my heart, tech people.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.940]   I'm going to go through each one.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.980]   So you guys should look at these core four
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.700]   as like really the basic ground level estate plan.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.180]   So if you have embarked on an estate plan,
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.820]   these are kind of the four that are like your very basic plan.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.980]   But if you have not embarked on any estate planning,
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.940]   these are going to be the kind of the starter
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.620]   package, so to speak.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.380]   So first and foremost is advanced directives.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.820]   And I'm going to say kind of slash living will declaration.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.500]   So these kinds of documents are specifically
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.140]   for health care decisions.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.900]   And more specifically, when we start talking about like end
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.180]   of life decisions, really fun things to talk about, I know.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.020]   Welcome to my life.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.900]   I talk about them every single day.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.220]   These documents are really important
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.660]   because this is what gives you guys the power
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.540]   to express what your wishes are as it relates to health care
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.700]   decisions.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.740]   Anyone in the room--
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.500]   I'm sure a lot of people in the room--
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.300]   do you guys remember the name Terri Schiavo?
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   Yes.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.500]   If you don't, I'll give you the quick crash course.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.900]   There was a young lady down in Florida.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.500]   I think it was in maybe late '90s.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.940]   She was in a persistent vegetative state.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.620]   Long story short, her husband and her parents
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.820]   went to like World War III over whether to keep her feeding
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.860]   tube in.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.380]   And what I always tell people is we
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.620]   got the opinion of everyone.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.620]   We got the opinion of politicians.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.980]   We got the opinion of courts.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.680]   We surely got the opinion from Nancy Grace.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.300]   We got a lot of people's opinion.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.780]   But whose opinion was the most important one?
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.540]   Hers, Terri's.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.980]   And that's the one we were missing.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.340]   And so that case really shined a bright light
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.740]   on this set of documents I'm talking about,
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.460]   the Living Will Declaration and advanced directives,
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.820]   because that's what she was missing.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.580]   So when you think of estate planning,
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.820]   I think a lot of people's focus goes really
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.020]   to what happens when I pass away, or financial,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.180]   or more legally focused.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.940]   But health care decision making is equally as important
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.460]   when you embark on this process.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.740]   So that's the first set, advanced directives slash
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.660]   Living Will Declaration.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.940]   Second set is a medical power of attorney or a health care
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.260]   representative.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.340]   I'm trying to keep things very high level and more general,
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.940]   because as Mike mentioned, I am only in Indiana.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.380]   Different states call these documents
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.860]   different things.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.540]   And so you may see this document called Appointment of Health
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.480]   Care Representative.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.100]   That's what my state of Indiana calls it.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.100]   But you may see health care power of attorney
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.340]   or medical power of attorney.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.060]   So any of these, it just depends on what your state calls it.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.140]   But they do effectively the same thing.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.380]   So documents number two, or like the second theme of documents,
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.860]   is this health care power of attorney.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.540]   So this is the document that states, if I am unable to--
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.860]   man, I thought that was my presentation again.
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.820]   If I'm unable to make health care decisions,
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.180]   who do I trust to make those for me?
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.740]   So that's the document that I state.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.140]   Maybe it's my spouse, or maybe it's my children.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.620]   And just a little insider secret,
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.620]   it doesn't have to be your oldest child.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.340]   I hear that all the time.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.940]   It doesn't even have to be the child that
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.300]   lives down the street.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.380]   I wish I could go on in more detail about this.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.940]   But there's a set of factors that you should weigh when
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.380]   you pick people in all of these roles.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.660]   So yeah, it doesn't have to be the oldest child.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.660]   But the primary purpose of this document
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.500]   is to put someone in a position to make your health care
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.820]   decisions for you if you're unable to do so.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:04.060]   Number three is a financial power of attorney.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.220]   So financial power of attorneys are specifically
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.100]   for people when they need to put someone in a position
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.740]   to help them with more financial and legal affairs.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.740]   So if you think about all these documents, a lot of the times
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.060]   these are not usually kicking in until something has happened,
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.980]   whether it's incapacity, whether it's
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.820]   death, which will be the documents that we
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.980]   talk about later.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.660]   But most of the time, the financial power of attorney
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.500]   is a document that kicks in.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.660]   I mostly see it in my practice when people are--
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.380]   they're dealing with some sort of cognitive impairment.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.460]   So think dementia, Alzheimer's, that sort of thing.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.260]   I always tell people, just because we
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.340]   are in that yucky situation doesn't
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.620]   mean the bills stop coming.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.540]   It doesn't mean that we get a pass on filing taxes.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.700]   And that's what the power of attorney's responsibility is,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.100]   is to keep your financial affairs, financial management
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.820]   afloat and under control.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.900]   As I talked about with Christine in her book, you will--
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.580]   and I could go on for hours about this too,
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.460]   but there are many types of financial power of attorneys
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.580]   for varying different situations.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.020]   So sometimes you'll see power of attorneys that really--
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.520]   oh.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:42.540]   OK, if I stand on one leg, maybe it'll pop up.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.660]   There's many different types of power of attorneys.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.380]   So you may see them limit the scope of the powers.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.100]   So there's some that say, hey, I'm
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.300]   only going to give you the power to do this one thing.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.060]   But you may see different power of attorneys
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.260]   that give someone much more--
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.800]   or all powers, really.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.300]   There's also power of attorneys that
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.820]   limit the scope on when they become effective.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.220]   So just be very mindful as to when you do a power of attorney,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.060]   be very mindful that you're choosing
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.820]   the type that is appropriate for your situation.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.540]   The last one, number four in my core four,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.180]   is a last will and testament.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.040]   So that's probably the most well-known document
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.020]   in my world.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.780]   I always tell people that a last will and testament,
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.300]   it doesn't mean diddly squat until we pass away.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.060]   So that's when that document becomes effective.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.980]   And it states-- it primarily does two things.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.020]   You'll see wills be five pages.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.260]   You'll see wills be 50 pages.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.380]   And even in the 50-page wills, they're still really kind
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.100]   of doing two things at its core.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.220]   So the first thing a will does is it states,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.820]   who's in charge after I pass away?
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.780]   So who is the ringleader of the circus?
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:11.420]   Secondly, it states who gets my stuff, who gets my assets,
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.980]   in what way?
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.420]   So when I say in what way, what I'm really talking about
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.060]   is in terms of maybe we're putting parameters
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.900]   around their inheritance, like staggered distributions based
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.540]   on age or something like that.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.740]   But wills, they do those two things and two things only.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.980]   And from kind of a 50,000-foot overview,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:43.020]   those four that I just talked about are the most basic level.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.100]   And sometimes those four are completely sufficient.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.260]   And sometimes you don't need any more.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.020]   But at the end of the day, those are kind of the basic documents
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.020]   at play.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.940]   One of the biggest mistakes I see people make all the time
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.700]   is really dealing with how assets are owned.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   And generally speaking, there's those three asset ownership
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.900]   or ways to set assets up.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.140]   So that first one, individually owned assets.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.740]   So when I say individually owned assets,
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.820]   it's quite literally what that is meaning.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.300]   It is one person's name on that asset
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.060]   and no beneficiaries attached.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.980]   That is usually going to be the only type of asset that
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.860]   is controlled by a last will and testament.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.320]   A lot of people don't realize that.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.260]   A lot of people think that wills just
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.360]   throw on their superhero cape when we pass away
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.300]   and take care of everything.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.340]   I wish it was that easy.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.940]   We should know that things aren't that easy.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.460]   So that is the only kind of category
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.860]   of an asset that's going to be controlled by a will.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.140]   And then that third bullet under that individually owned asset
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.180]   category, we're going to talk about probate in my next slide
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.780]   and what it is.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.140]   But that's usually going to be the only category that's
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.780]   going to force us to kind of entertain
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.460]   whether probate is going to be a part of our life
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.420]   or part of our estate administration.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.780]   Every state has a different threshold
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.680]   as to whether we're going to have to go through probate.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.180]   So what I mean by that is if I use Indiana, for example,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.780]   for the two people in here that live in my state,
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.780]   Indiana, for example, our threshold is 100,000.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.620]   So what that means and what I'm talking about
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.140]   is that if the assets that fit that category of one person's
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.340]   name on the asset with no beneficiaries attached
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.900]   exceed 100,000, we are going through the probate process.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.400]   Whether we have a will or not, that's
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.000]   another big misconception.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.280]   So that may be something to write down
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.820]   is what is my state's probate threshold?
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.520]   Because every state's different.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.400]   Second category is beneficiary designated assets.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.120]   So this is just like what it states.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.520]   Think of like retirement accounts, life insurance
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.680]   policies.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.000]   A lot of times those--
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.880]   a lot of times, not all--
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.680]   those kind of assets have a beneficiary designated on them.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.140]   So when we pass away, that asset is
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.640]   going to go to the designated beneficiary.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.720]   I have a slide towards the end of my presentation
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.680]   that I'm probably not going to get to,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.400]   since we've got a little bit of a late start.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.840]   But it was really about kind of real life cautionary tales
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.620]   that I've worked on.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.360]   And this is one of them, where people don't realize
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.040]   that if there's a conflict between a beneficiary
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.360]   designation on an asset and a will,
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.640]   the beneficiary designation is going to win.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.960]   So I am just wrapping up a case right now
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.000]   where a gentleman passed away, and he left his ex-spouse
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.160]   on his IRA and life insurance.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.040]   His daughter wasn't happy about that, as she should.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.080]   And so it's turned into a very messy administration,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.560]   because you have to consider the fact that maybe he
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.720]   intended to do that.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.280]   He's passed away now.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.760]   We can't just make things up.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.340]   We don't think he probably wanted that to happen,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.920]   but that's assuming.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.320]   So beneficiary designated assets, those assets at death
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.760]   go to whoever the beneficiaries listed are.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.140]   They're not controlled by your will.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.640]   Last type of asset type is jointly owned assets.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.000]   So what I mean by this is two or more people
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.040]   on an asset, so you think of a joint bank
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   account, for example.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.840]   Let's use a joint bank account as an example.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.800]   If I own-- me and my husband are both on a bank account.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.440]   At my death, that is going to go to my husband.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.120]   It's not going through the will.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.000]   It is just merely as a product of the type of asset ownership.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.680]   It's joint.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.560]   My last little bullet there, you have to be very--
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.120]   what's the word--
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.360]   hypersensitive of property when it comes to joint ownership.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.720]   When I say property, what I mean is like houses, farmland,
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   because I'm from Indiana.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:37.520]   Property ownership is a little funky.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.120]   So just know from this bullet if it's
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.120]   like joint ownership on a house, don't
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.880]   assume it's going to automatically
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.040]   go to that joint owner.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.700]   And they have a whole class in law school
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.960]   on property ownership.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.200]   So it just can be tricky, and you
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.360]   need to be very mindful of it.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.600]   OK, probate.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.760]   That is a word that cracks me up,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.000]   because I will meet with prospects or clients
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.680]   in my office, and I'll ask them about what their goals are,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.480]   what they're trying to accomplish.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.360]   And a lot of times, they'll say, I want to avoid probate.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.960]   And I'll say, OK, what do you think probate is?
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.760]   They're like, well, my great aunt
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.440]   told me that I need to avoid it.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.560]   I'm like, OK.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   So I made a slide specifically about probate
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.680]   to kind of give you good factual information on what
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.560]   this word even means.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.680]   So probate is a process that happens sometimes
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.240]   when we pass away.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.560]   And the sometimes piece is because of that last slide.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.400]   It depends on the type of assets when we pass away.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.960]   And if there are assets in that individually owned category
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.720]   with no beneficiaries attached, like I said,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.120]   whether we have a will or not, sometimes
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.920]   they're going through this probate process.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.200]   It is a court process.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.480]   And from there, I think there's a lot of professionals
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.960]   that will try just to scare the bejesus out of you
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.680]   on what this process is.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.720]   And I come from a place of always really not
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.320]   doing the whole fear tactic thing,
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.880]   but more of an educational side.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.160]   And when I say non-negotiables about probate,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.760]   what I'm talking about on this slide
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.600]   is that these are the three things that you have to decide
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.440]   really whether you care about these three things.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.640]   And if you don't, then maybe probate's just a formality
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.200]   sometimes when we pass away.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.960]   So hitting on the should I be scared or concerned first.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.080]   Should I be scared or concerned?
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.600]   My favorite lawyer answer in the entire world is it depends.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   It depends primarily on two things,
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.800]   on what you're trying to accomplish,
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.520]   as well as your state.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.240]   And I hate to be so kind of general about it,
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.920]   but some states' probate process is a nightmare.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.600]   Some states' probate process isn't so bad.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.800]   And so like, for example, California,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.920]   if there's any California folks in the room,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.280]   they have a pretty brutal probate process.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.960]   I just saw you raise your hand, and you're like, yep.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.760]   They have a pretty brutal probate process.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.640]   So it is very common to cite that as a reason when someone
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.200]   embarks on an estate planning process
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.280]   is to avoid that probate process.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.880]   Indiana's not that bad.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.520]   I do probate all the time, and I don't even
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.640]   set foot in the courthouse.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.760]   Everything's electronically filed.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   I don't handle any contested cases.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.600]   So my state's not too bad.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.480]   But these non-negotiables, just to hit on them,
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.840]   regardless of your state, when I say time, public record,
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.440]   and cost, those are the things that
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.360]   are going to occur with probate regardless of your state.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.560]   When I say time, what I mean by that is specifically,
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.480]   it's not going to happen overnight.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.840]   I always set the expectation for my clients in Indiana,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.000]   it's going to minimally take about six months.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.720]   But realistically, it's probably going to take about a year.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.360]   And there's just parts of the process
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.600]   that I just can't speed up.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.800]   It is like statutorily, like I have
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.640]   to sit and twiddle my thumbs for three months for creditors
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.040]   to make claims on the estate, whether someone
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   has creditors or not.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.200]   So there's just part of the process I just can't speed up.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.600]   So that's time.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.360]   Public record, if you don't know this,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.120]   anytime you're going to the courthouse,
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.520]   it's part of public record.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.680]   So I have some clients that are like, if my nosy neighbor
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.160]   Nancy finds out what's going through my estate,
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.080]   I would just roll over in my grave.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.440]   Sorry if there's any Nancys in the room.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.040]   So public record sometimes is a concern for people.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.960]   I always say, a lot of people don't
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.800]   know where to go to look, to look up this kind of stuff.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.680]   So I don't give that too much thought.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.600]   Lastly is cost.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.800]   When I say this, I typically kind of make--
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.080]   I'm a lawyer, yes.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.800]   But I make lawyer jokes all the time, because most of them
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.440]   are actually warranted.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.080]   From a cost standpoint, it makes me laugh,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.440]   because a lot of attorneys will say, oh, the probate cost.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.720]   Oh, the probate cost.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.440]   It's mostly the legal fees.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.400]   Yeah, sure, there's some filing fees with the county,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.120]   and maybe some publication fees for the newspaper.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.840]   Because we have to-- at least in Indiana,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.800]   we have to publish the estate in a newspaper.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.360]   I swear that we're the only ones that
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.520]   are keeping newspapers afloat.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.480]   So if there's anyone that works in a newspaper in the room,
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   you could verify that for me.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   But cost, sometimes probate can be costly
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.640]   from a legal fees standpoint.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.520]   It just depends on the complexity of the estate,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.760]   what's going on.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.800]   There's kind of two different schools of thought,
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.840]   from a cost perspective.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.280]   Sometimes attorneys will charge hourly, which is typical.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.320]   The other type of way to charge in probate land
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.680]   is through a percentage.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.720]   So a percentage of the estate is their legal fee.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.640]   I always say you have to sprinkle a dose
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.720]   of reasonableness on there.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   I think sometimes lawyers forget to sprinkle
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.960]   that reasonableness on there.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.360]   But nonetheless, those are the three non-negotiables.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.080]   Should you be scared or concerned?
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.560]   You need to work with someone in your state, someone like me
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.840]   that does a state as their normal field,
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.000]   and just kind of prompt them on this conversation
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.960]   and gather whether your state has a complex and annoying
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.680]   probate process.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.520]   So how am I doing on time?
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.280]   OK.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.000]   A lot of times people will entertain trust planning
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   as a part of an estate plan.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.280]   Do all people need trust?
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   No.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.040]   Do a lot of people need trust?
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.840]   Yes.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.680]   If you are working with an attorney that just shells out
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.720]   trust day after day, maybe not the attorney to work with.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.240]   It just really depends on the goals
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.080]   that the client's trying to accomplish.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.960]   It really depends on the family dynamics and family setup.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.600]   It depends on the types of asset.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.720]   But at the end of the day, a lot of people
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.480]   do choose to do trust planning as part of their estate plan.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.440]   And I'd be doing you guys a disservice
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.520]   if I didn't at least kind of give you
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.560]   a little bit of the 411 on trust planning.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   At its core, there are so many types of trust, guys.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.840]   Lots of them.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.000]   And us lawyers have these like weird nicknames for them.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.160]   It's kind of-- I don't know.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.720]   It's like job security or something.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.120]   Crack, crut, eyelet.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.040]   It's like a whole weird different language.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.840]   But of all those types of trust, really at the end of the day,
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.400]   you can kind of first break up types of trust
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.960]   by how they were created.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.720]   And what I mean by that is testamentary trust
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.760]   and living trust are kind of--
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.800]   they're like kind of the first basic step
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.760]   of identifying the type of trust that it is.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.520]   So a testamentary trust is a trust
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.440]   that's created in your last will and testament.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.120]   I paid a lot of money to go to law school to learn that.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.960]   Nonetheless, I see a lot of times
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.760]   with testamentary trust that are the kind that are created
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.680]   in the last will and testament.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.520]   A lot of times, those are what I like to refer to them
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.720]   as like standby trusts.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.640]   So what I mean by that are things like, OK,
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.680]   maybe we're a young family and we're just
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.400]   trying to get our core four done.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.280]   But maybe we have some minor kids
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.440]   that we want to put some perimeters around
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.160]   and how they inherit.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.640]   So there may be a standby trust inside people's wills to say,
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.200]   OK, I don't want little Susie to inherit at 18.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.800]   I want little Susie to inherit maybe a little bit at 18,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.720]   a little bit at 21, 25, 30, whatever.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.080]   So to accomplish something like that
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.440]   is going to be likely using a trust inside of your will.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.520]   And I say it's a standby trust because maybe you
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.320]   survive, ideally.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.040]   And little Susie is 60, 70 years old when you die.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.640]   So none of these little standby provisions are even applicable.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.360]   So they're just there just in case something happens.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   Another kind of standby I see all the time
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.480]   with testamentary trusts are special needs trusts.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.440]   So if we have any disabled or special needs beneficiaries
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.000]   in our lives, it breaks my heart when
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.800]   I hear people say, oh, I can't leave Johnny anything
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.880]   of my estate because he's special needs
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.600]   and he's on Medicaid.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.200]   Hear me loud and clear.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.880]   You can leave those kind of folks in inheritance.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.480]   They just have to be done in a very
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.360]   intentional and strategic way.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.520]   And that's often done through a special needs trust.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.280]   Whether that special needs trust is a testamentary trust
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.720]   in your will, or maybe it's a freestanding one.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.000]   And what I mean by freestanding is a nice segue
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.960]   to that living trust.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.800]   So if you think about it, a testamentary trust
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.560]   is created after we die because that's
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.320]   when the last will and testament kicks into action.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.880]   A living trust is one that's created while you are living.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.540]   So these are the common ones that you
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.520]   may have family, friends, or maybe yourself,
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.920]   like a revocable living trust.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.360]   That's a very popular kind of trust out there.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.720]   That is a type of a living trust because it's a trust
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.920]   that you create while you're living.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.280]   We're not waiting for it to activate after we pass away.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.560]   We're activating it now.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.840]   So just to hit on a few of the more popular ones I see,
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.440]   like I said, revocable living trust, that's a very common one
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.520]   to do to avoid that probate process.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.200]   I also see it all the time for individuals
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.720]   that have a very specific type of distribution
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.680]   that they're wanting to accomplish.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.240]   So think maybe we have a beneficiary that
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.280]   has some personal issues going on.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.400]   Maybe they're either terrible with money.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.080]   Maybe there's an addiction as part
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.640]   of the planning part of this.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.000]   A lot of times, we're using more advanced planning
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.080]   to accommodate them.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.720]   Irrevocable trust planning, those are most often
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.200]   used either for tax planning.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.240]   I wish I had a few extra minutes to talk about taxes,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.480]   but I don't.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.640]   But they're often used for estate tax planning purposes.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.240]   I use them all the time in my office for asset protection
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.040]   trust planning, specifically for long-term care
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.800]   and helping people qualify for Medicaid--
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.280]   not Medicare, Medicaid-- down the road.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.960]   So I use irrevocable trust all the time
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.880]   for people that have that goal.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.480]   Charitable trust, if you're charitably inclined,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.160]   there's many types of trust out there that allow you to support
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.480]   your favorite charitable organizations while receiving
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.560]   tax benefits along the way.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.960]   And special needs trust, I talked about.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.280]   You can actually create them now.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.360]   You can create them while you're living.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.400]   If you plan on gifting to that individual now--
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.920]   I set those up quite often, too.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.320]   One last note on this slide before I think probably
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.960]   we're shifting to questions.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.080]   Funding a trust.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.920]   I always tell people, oh, you have extra time.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.360]   Yay.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.840]   It's like a little love note.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.200]   OK, funding a trust.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.000]   If you do a trust as part of your estate plan,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   also hear me loud and clear on this, too.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.320]   Funding-- there's like three general steps
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.720]   when you create a trust.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   Create it, fund it, which I'm going
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.480]   to talk about in a second, and grow with it.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.480]   Because estate planning is not usually a one-time thing.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.760]   You've got to keep massaging it and keep
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   it applicable to what your current situation is.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.840]   So that second part, after we have the trust created--
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.000]   so we've got the document.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.600]   We've signed it.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.960]   The next step, the next vital step that people miss all
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.200]   the time is funding it.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.240]   Funding it is changing the ownership of your assets
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   or modifying beneficiary designations
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.640]   to support the actual trust document.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.480]   If you do not fund--
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.520]   if you don't get the trust funded,
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.040]   if you don't change ownership, if you don't modify
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.760]   your beneficiaries, the trust may not work at all.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.320]   It could be a pile of paper that you
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.440]   paid way too much money for.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.840]   And so funding a trust, I consider
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.600]   as part of setting--
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.480]   if I'm doing a trust for someone,
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.720]   that is part of our process is to help them get it funded.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.040]   But I cannot tell you the number of prospects and clients
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:52.280]   that I see that bring this honking big binder to my office
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.440]   and they flop it on the table.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.400]   And I'm looking through it, and I just casually--
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.080]   because I've done this too many times--
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.760]   casually say, so what's in this trust?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.120]   Did you move your house in?
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.920]   Is your brokerage in here?
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.400]   And they just look, and they're like, what?
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.280]   I don't think so.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.560]   And I'm like, oh, am I going to be the bearer of bad news?
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.240]   Well, not really the bearer of bad news,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.540]   but now we got to play clean up.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.600]   So if you do a trust, or if you have a trust,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.800]   make sure you get the thing funded.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.000]   If I work with someone like that,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.440]   if the trust that they already have is fine and dandy,
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.400]   we may have to amend it a tiny bit.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.600]   But otherwise, sometimes they'll hire me just
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.960]   to help get it funded, because maybe there
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.400]   wasn't an emphasis on that when they set it up,
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.880]   or maybe life got in the way, and they just totally
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.980]   forgot to get it done.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.440]   But nonetheless, very, very important to get that done.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:03.160]   Give me-- oh, I thought I had one more.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.760]   Yes, this, OK.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.880]   Should we go to questions, or can I do like one horror story?
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.360]   Horror stories, OK.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.760]   Oh, which one do I want to do?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.880]   Well, I already talked about that first one.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.360]   So the ex-spouse is a beneficiary
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.840]   in IRA and life insurance.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:26.640]   Long story short, what happened with that is basically,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.720]   they ended up settling.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.660]   Because like I said earlier, we don't know.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.080]   There was actually a little bit of a strained relationship
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.680]   between dad and daughter.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.160]   And so there was an argument to be
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.000]   made that maybe he just left the ex-spouse on there
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.200]   from a place of like, I don't know who else to leave,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.540]   so maybe he did it intentionally.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.720]   So in that case, they ended up settling.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   Ex-spouse did get to walk away with stuff
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.920]   with part of the gentleman's IRA and life insurance.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.760]   Which one do I want to do?
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   And then I'll shift to questions.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.120]   I'll do that next one, actually.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.080]   Because I think I've talked about beneficiaries
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.880]   with addictions and Medicaid.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.360]   Those just require special planning, guys.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.080]   I know it's not fun to talk about the elephant
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.640]   in the room things, but I can't do my job
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.440]   if I don't know about them.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.080]   But when I do know about those elephant in the room things,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.400]   I look like a superstar because I
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.680]   can do such awesome things for those types of individuals
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.480]   and beneficiaries.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.520]   So that's just a subtle encouragement,
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.160]   just to be very honest with whoever
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.000]   you work with from an estate planning attorney standpoint.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.240]   OK, so I'll do that next bullet, that put nephew as beneficiary,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.080]   but Will had seven nieces and nephews.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:43.440]   So this case, long story short, lady passed away.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.920]   Her Will had seven nieces and nephews listed as beneficiary,
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.840]   but she was one of those people that had lots of CDs.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.680]   She would be like a CD chaser.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.400]   We all know them.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.640]   Maybe you're one of them.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.840]   She would go to lots of different banks
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.000]   and find the highest interest rate.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.280]   Long story short, she passed away, and all of her assets
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.520]   had just one of the-- it was one of the nephews--
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:20.440]   just one nephew on as beneficiary on everything.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.280]   So the Will had, hey, I want to split it
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.880]   between these seven people, but then
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:30.080]   on the actual beneficiary, it had this one person.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.320]   And so we got it cleaned up, but this
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.880]   is a little bit of a cautionary tale horror story
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.280]   because that family had to pay me more to clean it up
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.080]   because generously, the nephew that was listed, he was like,
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.480]   I know this is what she wanted to share,
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.400]   so I'm going to disclaim and let it go to the other six,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.440]   between all seven.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.200]   So I mean, I had to do a significant amount of extra
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.320]   work to accommodate what this person was
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   trying to accomplish.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.560]   So it's just a lesson in making sure--
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.320]   kind of what I was blabbing about earlier of really making
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.720]   sure that we get our assets in a place
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.240]   to really support what we're trying to accomplish.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.600]   It's single-handedly.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.840]   The biggest misconception-- or biggest mistake
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.320]   that I see people make is they do this--
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.000]   they do their estate plan, and then
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   they fail to really take a look at their assets
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.800]   and get it to support those documents.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.920]   OK, I'm ready for Shark Tank questions.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.840]   Thank you so much, Jenny.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.640]   If I was the one up here yesterday
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   without my slides, my little introvert stage fright heart
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.680]   would have just collapsed and died in front of all of you.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.640]   So can we get some applause for Jenny, please?
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.140]   Oh.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:01.000]   You also have at least three times as many questions
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.960]   as anybody else has got.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.740]   I see a pile.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.600]   OK, for those who are young and in good health,
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.360]   is it still important to do trust estate
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.720]   planning in your 30s or 40s?
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.040]   And if you change your mind later in life,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.200]   should we contact lawyers again to update the will?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.560]   Yes.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.520]   Kind of like I was saying earlier about estate planning
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.800]   should grow with you, it is vital for those
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.080]   in their 30s and 40s that may have minor kids
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.200]   to get guardianship provisions as part of their estate plan.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.800]   Vital to get that in place.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.360]   And then as far as updating it in the future,
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.000]   you don't have to use the attorney
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.240]   that you used back then, unless you contracted with them
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.520]   and said, like, you're going to be my attorney forever.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.320]   But that would be weird.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.120]   Find someone that you like.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   Make sure that-- yeah, find someone you like.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.760]   It pains me when people say, oh, I
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.960]   have to go back to my dad's lawyer back home.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.520]   And I'm like, no, you don't.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.600]   No, you don't.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.240]   Can you speak to when the deceased and the beneficiaries
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.440]   are in different states?
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.480]   Whose laws apply?
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   It depends.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.520]   That's only the second time I've said that.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.400]   Kind of impressive.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.880]   So it primarily depends-- so from an estate administration
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.960]   standpoint, it's going to be the state in which the decedent,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.080]   the deceased person, died, unless they
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   have property in other states.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.160]   So I have a lot of clients that will
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.880]   have their primary residence in Indiana,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.160]   but maybe they have a house in Florida or Arizona
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.000]   or something.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.520]   Those are going to be-- those assets
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.080]   are going to be dictated by those other states' laws.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.840]   But the only caveat I would place on why I said it depends
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:50.720]   is because some states still have inheritance tax.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.400]   Not all of them, but some do.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.640]   And if the beneficiary lives in a state that still
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.760]   has inheritance tax--
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.920]   excuse me-- the inheritance tax is going to apply.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.600]   Oh, no, do you live in an inheritance--
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.320]   That's me.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.520]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.240]   Yeah, it's a small list, and it seems to be decreasing.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.000]   But if the beneficiary does live in a state that
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.040]   has an inheritance tax, that's going to apply to them.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.560]   And is it true that at the state level,
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.880]   it matters whether it's an inheritance tax or an estate
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.560]   tax?
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.400]   Say that again.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.820]   At the state level, does it matter
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.680]   whether it's an inheritance tax or an estate tax?
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.160]   Yes, because they're very different.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.280]   Inheritance tax and estate tax are very different.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.640]   Inheritance tax is taxed on the beneficiary,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.120]   while estate tax is taxed on the estate.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.160]   And even more confusing, there's federal estate tax,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.680]   which I think it's $13.61 million per person currently.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.520]   They're talking about making that lower.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.880]   So just FYI, keep an eye on that.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.960]   But some states also have an estate tax.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.280]   So yeah, be mindful of that.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.480]   Please discuss the pros and cons of a springing
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.680]   versus non-springing power of attorney.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.480]   Oh, gosh.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.200]   OK.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.360]   So springing power of attorneys often
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.120]   spring into action upon some sort of trigger,
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.360]   some sort of event.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.200]   So I normally see these where a springing power of attorney,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.240]   say, for example, doesn't come into action
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.940]   until documented incapacity, which could be problematic,
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.000]   because doctors often don't like just going around declaring
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.240]   people incapacitated.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.560]   And so I typically recommend-- and I actually
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.280]   talked about this in Christine's book,
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.440]   the section I helped her with.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.680]   I typically recommend a general durable power of attorney.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:52.000]   And I say-- and the opposite of durable is springing.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.280]   So they kind of conflict with each other,
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.920]   because durable kind of grants it immediately,
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.420]   grants authority immediately.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.340]   But I always tell people--
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.840]   like, that was a lot of legalese.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.220]   And what I always tell people is,
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.860]   if you trust the person to be in the document,
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.600]   you probably should trust the person
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.100]   not to do any funny business, even
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.500]   though you're fine and dandy.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.100]   And so that's why I typically recommend
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.620]   a general durable power of attorney for clients.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.180]   If I move out of state, should I redo my estate plan?
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.300]   And what about my trust?
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.100]   If you move out of state, I always
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.380]   encourage people to have an estate
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.240]   attorney in the new state take a look at the documents.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.680]   Because I was talking to Mike, actually,
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.400]   right before this session, that annoyingly, they really
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.240]   put the thumb down on us attorneys
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.440]   in terms of licensure.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.120]   So I can only help people--
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.640]   the two people in this room that are from Indiana--
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.120]   I'm joking.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.480]   But at the end of the day, you have
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.040]   to make sure that it's doing not only what you want it to do,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.100]   but also in compliance with wherever
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.460]   your state of residency is.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.980]   And so every state may have different laws,
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.780]   and you need to be cognizant of that.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.260]   A lot of times, it doesn't require a whole rewrite,
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.060]   but it may require a little bit of a shift or an amendment
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.860]   to get in compliance with the new state.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.340]   How do you feel about a spouse being
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.540]   medical power of attorney?
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.620]   Does that put them in too emotional of a situation?
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.460]   Oh, I kind of want to know who asked that.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.700]   I would say, generally speaking, most people
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:29.740]   put their spouse as medical power of attorney primary, most.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.740]   Very rarely do I see people say, they're
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.380]   going to be too emotional.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.420]   You have to put yourself--
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.540]   a lot of us have probably been in a situation
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.420]   where there's a major medical decision that has to be made.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.140]   The emotions are quite high.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.360]   And sometimes people have concerns
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.820]   around whether their spouse can look at things
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:57.460]   from a more fact-based, less emotional approach.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.220]   So most of the time, most, a heavy majority,
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.500]   like 99.99999% of the time, people
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.460]   put their spouse as primary.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:09.160]   But ever so often, I'll have someone say, you know what?
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.100]   I don't want to put that burden on them.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.980]   And that's the beautiful thing about state planning.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:19.180]   You've got to do what works well for you and your family.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.020]   So that segues into this one.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.380]   These are two almost identical questions.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.180]   Is it best, and separately, is it most common
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.980]   to divvy the estate equally among the children?
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   Or is it best to leave more to each child
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.220]   based on their financial status?
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.780]   That's a ooh.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.820]   I like the ooh.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:46.780]   Again, typically, most people do equally between their kids.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.020]   Though I have heard people say before
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.580]   where they may do an unequal approach if their relationship
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.980]   is strained, where maybe there's just like--
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.860]   there's some-- I don't know what the word I'm looking for is.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.180]   But there's something between maybe
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.860]   like the parent and the child.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:11.340]   And they don't have it in their heart to disinherit them.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.340]   But they'll leave them maybe a smaller amount.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.060]   The only other thing I've heard on that topic
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.780]   is whether you should consider if you
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.740]   have a child that's like someone that's
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.340]   making a lot of money versus--
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.820]   let's say one child that's a doctor, one child that's
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.900]   a social worker.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:36.940]   I really try hard not to put my personal opinion in things.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.460]   I don't think it's my job to say like, well,
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.340]   you shouldn't penalize the doctor in this situation.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.940]   But at the end of the day, you have
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.500]   to do what feels good in your heart and your brain.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.340]   I have done some situations where I just--
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.980]   in my heart, I didn't agree with what the client was doing.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.060]   Client didn't know that.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.940]   But you just have to do what's best for you.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.660]   And while I'm on the topic of when
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.140]   I said about maybe a strained relationship with the child,
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.020]   if you do choose to disinherit a child,
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.260]   please do not leave them a dollar.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.220]   Don't do it.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.060]   It's bad.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.580]   You're making them a beneficiary.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.300]   And beneficiaries are entitled to certain parts of notice
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.280]   and accountings and things like that.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.580]   So it's like an old school approach to do that.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.660]   I'm going to leave you a dollar to disinherit you.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.100]   Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.000]   Can transfer upon death property avoid probate?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.540]   Yes.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.380]   Yeah, transfer on death is a--
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.460]   transfer on death and payable on death
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.740]   are technically a beneficiary.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.660]   So when I was talking earlier about the different ways
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.120]   to own assets, we had individually owned.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.300]   That second one was beneficiary designated.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.420]   Transfer on death and payable on death
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.220]   are types of beneficiary designations.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.500]   You have to be very mindful, though, of--
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.580]   I've also seen everything in my world
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.180]   just feels like it's--
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.980]   if it's too good to be true, it is.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.140]   That's a really helpful, easy way to avoid probate.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.600]   There are some considerations there
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.620]   that you need to walk through in your head
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.660]   that I at least help clients walk through.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.700]   So if you put a transfer on death on a house
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:17.200]   to maybe three kids, I really hope those three kids
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.620]   know how to work well together.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.500]   Because if they don't, we could be in a world of hurt
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.700]   just because we were trying to avoid probate, which we did.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.940]   But now they're fighting because we can't agree on something.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.020]   So just make sure you're--
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.260]   when you think about your goals, like, OK,
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.740]   if we want to avoid probate, great.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.500]   Let's make sure we understand all the consequences
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.660]   of what we're choosing to do.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.120]   How do I find a good estate lawyer?
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.220]   And what questions should I ask them when interviewing?
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.300]   You need to find--
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.660]   you don't need to.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.460]   I would encourage you to find an attorney when
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:58.860]   you embark on an estate process that does this day in and day
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.380]   out.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.020]   The kind of annoying thing about the law
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.660]   is that when we come out of law school,
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:10.140]   we can really do any type of field that we want.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.820]   So I could technically help people
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:19.580]   with a divorce or a bankruptcy or criminal DUI or whatever.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.780]   Do I know how to do any of those things?
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.180]   No, not at all.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.020]   I wouldn't even know where to begin.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.140]   But my law license says that I could.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.540]   So the difficult thing is that if you
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.900]   find an attorney that does all these different kinds
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.500]   of fields, they may be stretched a little too thin
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.540]   on their knowledge.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.140]   Like, our brain is only so big.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.500]   And you can only--
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.660]   I would encourage you to work with someone that does--
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.700]   has really reined in their practice areas
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.060]   and knows them really deeply, rather than someone
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.620]   that does a lot of different practice areas
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.780]   and is kind of just ever so--
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.820]   knows a lot, but not a lot of a lot.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.980]   Within the estate planning field,
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.820]   should I assume that an estate planning attorney can also
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.820]   help with the estate tax planning?
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.780]   Or is that a separate area of expertise?
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.280]   It is technically a separate area.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.820]   It's actually something you and I were about to start talking
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.940]   about before this session, that even within the estate planning
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.260]   space, there's almost different areas of estate planning.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.620]   There's estate tax planning.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.580]   There's elder law.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.900]   I do-- a big part of my practice is elder law planning.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.540]   And so if you have estate tax concerns,
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.480]   make sure that person knows.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.860]   And a lot of times, you can look,
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.440]   and I think that was part of the question, the prior question,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.500]   is like, how do I know someone knows how to do this?
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.340]   One, if the lawyer actually has a website, which
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.940]   I say that totally seriously, because not a lot of lawyers
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.180]   have a website.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.660]   That's weird.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.020]   But look at their bio.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.260]   Look to see what kind--
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.940]   like Mike mentioned earlier, I belong
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.660]   to the probate trust, real property
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.100]   section, the elder law division, the estate division.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.460]   That's what I live and breathe.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.660]   But if you see people that are hanging out
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.620]   in like criminal division, that's probably not
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.660]   going to be someone that you should work with
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.580]   to do your estate planning.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.820]   Yeah, so be conscious of that.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.460]   If you have estate tax concerns, make
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.020]   sure you're working with someone that
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.100]   knows those weird acronyms that I said earlier,
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.580]   like CRETS and CRETS and ILETS and SLATS.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.740]   I think we have to wrap up.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.480]   I know, it's sad.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.820]   Thank you so much for your time.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.860]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:45.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
