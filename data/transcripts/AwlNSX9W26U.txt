[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.640]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in the fourth chapter, verses nine and ten. Verses nine
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:22.480]   and ten in the fourth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians. "Now that he ascended, what
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.960]   is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.640]   is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things."
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.920]   Now, we remember, most of us, that these two verses, indeed as they show themselves by
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.680]   this word now, are connected with what has gone before, so I will read again verses seven
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.520]   and eight as well. "But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.400]   of the gift of Christ. Wherefore, he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.640]   captive and gave gifts to men. Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.080]   first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.640]   up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things."
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.920]   Here, I would remind you hurriedly again, the great apostle is considering this question
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.440]   of the importance, the central, crucial importance of unity in the Christian Church. He is appealing
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.600]   to these people to endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace, and he
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.640]   has given them various reasons for doing so. But now he comes to this new aspect of the
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.240]   matter, which is that one of the most wonderful things about this unity is the diversity that
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.960]   exists within it. Unity does not mean a mechanical sameness, a grab kind of similarity. No, no,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.000]   the glory, the central glory of a true unity is that it is a unity in variety. Now the
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.200]   scripture is full of this idea, and we can think of it in passing this morning. Think
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.280]   of the great unity in nature and creation. There are no two flowers which are identical,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.000]   and yet there is that sameness, there is that unity. God is the maker and creator of all,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and if we have eyes to see, we will see the marks of his fingers, his handiwork in everything.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   But nothing is so wonderful about this great unity of creation as the endless variety and
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.680]   variation, these slight differences in color and shape and size and all these things. Well,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.480]   now it is exactly the same in the life of the Church. Unto every one of us is given
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.360]   grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. And therefore the great question
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.800]   confronting us is, how do these two things manage to exist at the same time? How can
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.560]   you have diversity and yet unity? How can you have unity in the presence of variety
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.240]   and of variation? And the apostle's answer is that it is to be explained in one way only,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.080]   and that is the lordship of Christ. He is the head of the Church. Every one of us is
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.800]   given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. It is always the same giver.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.480]   He gives to all. And it is because he is the giver and because he gives to all and controls
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.040]   all that though there are variations in the particular gifts and in the persons who receive
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.080]   the gifts, nevertheless there is this fundamental oneness, this essential unity.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.520]   Now we have been looking at all that, but we have come to this point and we have asked,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.640]   what is it then that has put our Lord into this position in which he is thus the head
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.920]   of the Church and the dispenser, the giver, of all these gifts that exist in the life
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:35.000]   of the Church? And the answer is, says the apostle, that he is the Messiah. He is the
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.680]   one who has earned for himself the right to do all this. And, says Paul, there is nothing
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.600]   new about all this. This has been prophesied and predicted. "Wherefore, he saith," in
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   verse 8, "when he ascended upon high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.080]   men." Now we expounded that last Sunday morning, and what we found was this, that the great
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:09.960]   apostle argues that Psalm 68, verse 18, is simply a reference to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.360]   And we saw the importance of that, for we saw that that psalm refers to Jehovah, and
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.880]   that clearly, therefore, the apostle identifies the Lord Jesus Christ with Jehovah. He is
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.200]   the Lord of the Old Testament. He is this person who is so frequently spoken of in the
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:41.000]   Old Testament. And, therefore, his claim here is that the Lord Jesus Christ is Jehovah,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.380]   the giver of all these gifts, the one who has ascended upon high and who has led captivity
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.800]   captive. So we ended by putting it like this, that the apostle, therefore, conceives of
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:02.080]   our blessed Lord when he ascended into heaven as a kind of great victor, a great military
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:10.000]   captain who has won a resounding victory over all his enemies and has now gone back to his
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.160]   homeland in a great triumphal procession, leading captive these people whom he has conquered
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:25.000]   and delivering and administering his largesse and his benefits to the acclaiming populace
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.800]   who are standing by and watching the great procession. That is, clearly, the idea that
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:39.880]   the apostle has in his mind. But now, we notice that he doesn't leave it at that. He is obviously
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   anxious to prove this, to prove that he is right in applying and describing the statement
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.960]   of Psalm 68/18 to our blessed Lord and Savior. So, in these two verses we are looking at
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   this morning, verses 9 and 10, he takes up the matter and he expounds it. Now, in this
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.840]   authorized version in front of me, these two verses are in brackets. That's all right,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.080]   as long as we realize that it is a part of the whole statement, but that it is a kind
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:20.640]   of exposition. The apostle is preaching here on Psalm 68/18, and his object, I say, in
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   doing so, is to prove, to establish beyond any doubt at all, that this reference there
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.680]   is to our Lord and to none other. Now then, let's watch him as he does it. What's his
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   exposition? Well, here it is. "Now," he says, "now." Now he's going to argue. "Now," and
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.640]   then the next phrase that I want to pick out is, "What is it but?" "What is this?" "Now,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.840]   what is this?" In other words, he is giving an exposition. And the word he concentrates
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   on is the word "ascended." Now, he says, the fact that he ascended, what is it but that
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.360]   he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? What is his argument? Well,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:23.880]   his argument is this. He says there, you read in Psalm 68, a great hymn of praise to Jehovah,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.840]   who has given David this marvelous victory that he's celebrating. Indeed, it was he who
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.920]   gave that notable victory to the children of Israel, over Pharaoh and his hosts, and
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.680]   took them through the Red Sea, and so on. It was still Jehovah. It's all in terms of
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:49.560]   him. It's a psalm about Jehovah, Yah, and his glories, and his excellences, and his
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:58.680]   virtues. "Yes, but," says Paul, "he says about Jehovah that he has ascended." The question
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:07.200]   is how can Jehovah ascend? Jehovah means "I am that I am." Jehovah means the eternally
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.860]   existing one, without beginning, without end of days, from eternity to eternity. Jehovah,
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.840]   I am that I am, or some would prefer to put it, I am what I shall be, which means that
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   I always am the same. Well, how can you speak of Jehovah as ascending? Well, says the apostle,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:36.080]   there's only one way in which you can do that. If Jehovah, who exists from eternity to eternity
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:49.120]   in the heavens, can be spoken of as ascending, it must be that he must have descended first.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.540]   Because as he is, there is no possibility of ascending. He is already in the highest
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:10:03.920]   heavens and filling everything. So the very use of the term ascend implies a prior descent.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:11.400]   Now that he ascended, what is it then but that he descended first into the lower parts
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:18.900]   of the earth? When you speak of a divine person who is absolute in all his qualities and powers
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:26.940]   as ascending, there is only one inevitable conclusion to which you can come, and that
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:35.080]   is that there must have been a descent first. And when you come to talk about the descent
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:42.440]   in the Godhead, there is only one way in which you can do so, and that is to consider Jesus
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:51.520]   of Nazareth the Son of God. It is there and there alone that God, Jehovah, has descended.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:58.680]   So the apostle argues, "I therefore prove to you that this statement in Psalm 68, 18
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:07.080]   is and can only be a reference to our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ." So he is not
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.720]   doing violence to the Scripture as he applies all this to our Lord. There is no other conceivable
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:20.600]   explanation. There is no other possibility. It is the only way in which God has ever descended
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:27.240]   to earth and again has ascended back into heaven. Well, that is the first part of his
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.520]   exposition, but now we come to another portion which is a little more difficult. Some would
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:42.040]   say very much more difficult. I want to hold before you this phrase. Now that he ascended,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:52.560]   what is it? But that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. Now here
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:12:00.760]   is the problem. What is the meaning of the phrase, "the lower parts of the earth"?
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.920]   And again I would say, as I said last Sunday morning, all who are at all familiar with
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.600]   the history of doctrine in the Church, and the history of the creeds for that matter,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:19.520]   will know that this particular phrase has played a most prominent part, and on it people
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.960]   have not hesitated to make certain statements and to propound certain doctrines. "The lower
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:33.680]   parts of the earth." What does it mean? Well, a large number of answers have been put forward
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.360]   to that question. I am not going to deal with them all exhaustively this morning. Indeed,
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.720]   we would not have time to do so, but I am bound to indicate what some of them are, because
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.560]   I feel that we often use phrases without quite knowing what we mean. In churches where it
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.720]   is customary to recite creeds and so on, people recite, "Sunday by Sunday he descended into
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.840]   hell." I wonder how many of them know exactly what they mean as they repeat that phrase.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.960]   Well, you see, that was obtained from this verse, from a particular exposition of this
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.400]   verse. And therefore, as it is our business to worship intelligently, we are forced to
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.800]   consider an exposition of this particular phrase.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:24.280]   Now, here are some of the ideas that have been put forward. Some have said that it is
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:33.440]   just a reference to our Lord's birth of the Virgin Mary, that he was born of the Virgin's
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:45.040]   womb. Now, there is something to say in favour of this, because you will find in Psalm 139,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:54.840]   verse 13, these words, "For thou hast possessed my reins; thou hast covered me in my mother's
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:02.200]   womb. I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:12.120]   and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:28.240]   and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth." So they say that this is just
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:36.960]   a reference to the virgin birth and to the fact that our Lord was in the virgin's womb.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:43.280]   There are others who say that it is a reference to the grave, that the earth is the earth.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:53.200]   Yes, but the lowest parts of the earth are a reference to something beneath the ground
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.920]   surface. Therefore, they say, "the grave." There are others who go further and say, "No,
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:07.960]   it is a reference to hell. Hell is down, heaven is up," they say. So the lower parts of the
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:19.240]   earth are a reference to hell or to Hades. Now, as I say, I needn't stay with these.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:27.400]   With regard to the first two, all I would indicate is that, obviously and patently,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:35.720]   in that 139th psalm, verse 15, the reference is to something, again, that happened on earth.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   It did certainly not happen in the depth of the earth, somewhere down at some great depth.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.440]   Man is not formed down in the earth, down in some pit or well in the bottom of the earth,
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:55.400]   as it were. No, no, it is just a pictorial phrase for describing how a man is born and
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.120]   formed in his mother's womb. So there is no reference to going down in that kind of
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:10.880]   physical or material sense. And the same applies, of course, to the grave. That is not the explanation.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.600]   So the important one for us to consider is this third one, for this is the one that has
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   rarely figured most prominently in the history of the Church and the history of doctrine.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.880]   There are those, I say, who believe that this is a reference to the fact that our Lord,
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:36.600]   after his death and burial, went down into hell and did certain things there. There are
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.320]   those who claim that what he did there was finally to conquer the devil and all his hosts.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.080]   Others say that what he did was to set at liberty the saints of the Old Testament who
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.560]   had been held in a sort of captivity ever since their death. Our Lord goes down and
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.380]   brings them out and leads them up with him. I glanced at that in passing last Sunday morning.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.120]   And there are others who put it like this, that what our Lord really did when he descended
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:12.600]   into hell was that he proclaimed salvation to certain of the persons who were there.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.400]   That of course they base not only upon this text but upon the text I am going to quote
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:24.120]   to you now, which is in the first epistle of Peter, in the third chapter, beginning
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:32.040]   to read at verse 17. 1 Peter 3, beginning at verse 17, "For it is better if the will
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil doing. For Christ also hath
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:46.840]   once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:56.120]   death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit, by which also he went and preached unto the
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:03.600]   spirits in prison, which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:10.480]   in the days of Nau, while the ark was a-preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.520]   by water." Now the material phrase is, "the spirit by which also he went and preached
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:22.240]   unto the spirits in prison." Now they say that means one thing only, and that is that
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:28.560]   our Lord, after his death and burial, went down into hell, and there he preached the
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:35.960]   gospel to these people who were destroyed in the flood in the days of Nau. He went down
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:42.520]   and preached the gospel to them, gave them a second chance, another opportunity. And
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.160]   as you know, there are some who go further even at that point and say that there will
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.720]   be a second chance and a further opportunity to everybody after this life in hell. Now
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.760]   that is the kind of thing that people say with regard to this statement, the lower parts
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:04.400]   of the earth. They say this is the same as 1 Peter 3, 19, etc. And it is just an indication
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:12.660]   that our Lord went there and preached or evangelized these spirits in prison.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.240]   And then there is another explanation which says that what he really did there was not
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.140]   to preach the gospel to them in a sense that he was giving them the chance to believe it,
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.440]   but that he just went down and proclaimed his resounding victory to all the inhabitants
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.400]   and the inmates of hell. He just proclaimed the victory. He told them how he had overcome
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.040]   everybody and everything and he was Lord over all.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.080]   Well now then, there you see are statements which have been put forward from time to time
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:50.120]   in the long history of the Church. It is my conception of the business of preaching and
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.080]   of teaching that we should face these matters and not skip over them and leave them because
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.440]   this obviously has got some meaning. Well, I want to try to suggest to you that it rarely
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.600]   carries none of these meanings at all and that the meaning of the phrase "the lower
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:15.520]   parts of the earth" is just the earth itself. Now, what are my reasons? Well, they are these.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:23.040]   As I have already told you, if you look at that statement in Psalm 139, verse 15, you
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:30.640]   will have to agree that it means, obviously, the earth. When a man is born on earth, comes
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.520]   into being, enters into life on earth, although the phrase is "the lower parts of the earth."
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.760]   You will find a similar reference in Psalm 63, verse 9. There it perhaps may have the
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.840]   meaning "the grave," but again it is very uncertain. But, of course, the crucial matter
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:58.000]   is this exposition of 1 Peter 3, verse 19. Patently, I have not got time to go into this
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.360]   thoroughly, but I do want to put before you the exposition which seems to me to be perfectly
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.040]   satisfactory and explains everything and which avoids all these speculations which lead people
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:19.860]   into so many difficulties. What is Peter saying there? Is he saying that our Lord went and
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:28.240]   preached to these particular people who had been destroyed in the flood in the time of
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.400]   Noah? Well, I am putting it to you that that cannot be the explanation for this reason
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:44.340]   alone. Why should they be given a second chance more than any other sinners? Why were they
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:53.020]   the only people preached to? Why was it that this gospel was again put before that particular
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.340]   group only? There were people who had sinned before those people at the time of the flood.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.180]   There were people who sinned after that time. Why are they alone given the opportunity?
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.900]   Why not the people of Sodom and Gomorrah? Why not many other examples of people who
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:14.420]   were suddenly killed and destroyed by the action of God? Why are these singled out only?
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:20.800]   And there is no answer. There is really no answer whatsoever. Their position as sinners
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.180]   is no different from the position of anybody else as sinners. The fact of the matter is
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.380]   that the Apostle Peter is not saying that at all. What he is saying is this. He is saying
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.740]   to these Christian people, "Now you are living in a time of judgment." He goes on
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.940]   in the next chapter to say, "Judgment must begin at the house of God." He is warning
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:48.300]   them of the coming of judgment. He tells them that there is only one way to be saved. He
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.460]   mentions it in the verses that follow. He says, "Noah and his family were saved by
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.420]   the ark." We are saved by the same kind of ark, baptism into Christ, and in Christ
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:05.380]   was our ark. We are saved. And what he is therefore saying is this. He says, "The
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:13.180]   position now in the world is similar to what it was just before the flood. Christ is speaking
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:19.940]   in the Spirit now through me and the other apostles, warning God's people, warning
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.460]   the others to flee from the wrath to come." He did exactly the same thing in the Spirit
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:31.420]   through Noah before the flood. There are only two great judgments in the history of mankind.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   The first was the flood, the second will be when the Lord comes again and the elements
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:43.380]   will burn with fervent heat, and the final judgment. They are the two great judgments.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:49.740]   So Peter is saying there is a wonderful parallel here. You are now in the age and the era of
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.460]   the second great judgment. There was the previous one, the parallel is perfect. He preaches
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:01.500]   in Spirit now through the apostles, he preached in Spirit then through Noah to those people.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:08.220]   Now it seems to me that that is the only conceivable explanation of that passage. Otherwise, you
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:15.380]   are left with this problem. Why was the gospel preached only to those particular sinners
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:20.900]   and not to all sinners? Why are they made favorites? Why are they being given a special
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:27.420]   opportunity? And it seems to me that there is no other solution to this problem. So that
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.940]   if we are going to try to buttress up our exposition of this ninth verse in the fourth
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:40.540]   chapter of Ephesians by abusing 1 Peter 3.19, we find it does not help us at all. And therefore
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:47.480]   it seems to me that here again that whole explanation breaks down. And we have no evidence
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:55.160]   at all that our Lord ever preached in hell. It is a supposition, it is a speculation,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:00.620]   it is a theory. There is nothing, not a word in the scriptures, to substantiate it. There
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.860]   is not a word to say that he liberated people who had been held captive. We have no idea
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.780]   at all that they were held captive. We are told they were in Abram's bosom, but that
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:18.180]   is not captivity. There is no indication, I say, whatsoever, that our Lord finally conquered
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:26.740]   the devil and his powers after his death there in hell. Because indeed we are told positively
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:33.340]   that that work was done upon the cross. Listen to Paul putting it himself in the second chapter
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:38.620]   of the epistle to the Colossians, where he puts it like this, verse 15, "And having
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:46.060]   spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly"—not in the lower
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:52.180]   parts of the earth, he did it openly—"triumphing over them in it." What is that? His death
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:26:00.140]   upon the cross. And you remember that it was on the cross that our Lord cried out, saying,
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:08.180]   "It is finished! It is finished! There was nothing left to be done in hell. The work
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.820]   was really completed upon the cross."
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:18.820]   But finally, for me to end this bit of exposition, there are other statements in the scripture
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:26.300]   which, when you take them together with this statement, I think must lead you to the conclusion
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:32.060]   that this is nothing but a graphic and a pictorial way of describing our Lord's coming down
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:38.260]   to earth. Not that he is going down into some depth, but he is coming from heaven to earth.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:44.540]   What is it but that he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth?
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:52.820]   Now listen to these phrases. Take, for instance, what our Lord says in John 3.13, "No man,
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:00.100]   he says, hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:06.900]   men which is in heaven." There you have again the ascending and descending—the descending
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.020]   and the ascending. And it is in terms not of going down to hell, but of coming down
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.980]   on earth. He is on earth and he is speaking to Nicodemus on earth. And he says, "I know
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.740]   what I am talking about. No man has ever gone up into heaven to speak to God and to listen
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:30.140]   to God's secrets. I have come down from heaven. We speak that which we do know, and
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:37.420]   testify that which we have seen. I have come down from heaven, and still I am in heaven."
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:48.180]   There is the same contrast. Or take what you get in John 8.23, "You are from beneath;
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:55.980]   I am from above." There it is again, you see, "I am from above; you are from beneath."
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.180]   He did not mean that they were down in some pit under the earth. No, they are on the earth,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:10.060]   but he calls being on the earth "from beneath." "Ye are of the world; I am not of this world."
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.140]   Exactly the same contrast. And it is a contrast between being from above, from heaven, and
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:22.340]   being on earth, not under the earth. And again, a final quotation from Acts 2.19.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:28.300]   Peter is preaching on the day of Pentecost, and he quotes this, "And I will show wonders
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:40.460]   in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapor of smoke." You see,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:47.220]   he must not literalize these expressions "beneath" or "lower parts" or "under." The contrast
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:56.180]   patently is between heaven above and earth beneath. And therefore what the apostle is
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:07.340]   here saying is that this Jehovah who has ascended, yes, far above all heavens, he says. Well,
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.620]   there again, you see, is a pictorial phrase. "Far above all heavens" just means "in the
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:18.100]   highest heaven," "in the highest place conceivable." But he does not say "in the highest place
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.780]   conceivable." He says "far above all heavens." But there is a sense in which there is not
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.580]   anything far above all heavens. Heaven is heaven. So again, you see, it is just one
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:34.060]   of these expressions to bring out an emphasis. And he is saying, therefore, "What is this?
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:47.580]   He that ascended far above all heavens is the same who also first descended to earth,
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:53.860]   to these lower parts, the earth. As the heavens are the higher, the highest parts, earth are
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:04.020]   the lower parts. The contrast is between heaven and earth. And therefore, the apostle here,
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:12.420]   I trust you are all now ready to believe and to accept, is showing us that what puts our
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.620]   Lord into the position in which he is the giver of all these gifts to the Church, and
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:24.020]   is the head of the Church and is Lord of all over the Church, what puts him into that position
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:30.180]   is the work which he did when he was here on earth. He has ascended and he is in that
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:37.940]   position because he first descended and came on earth and did various things while he was
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:45.500]   here. And you see, if you accept and adopt that exposition and explanation, you are saved
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:52.340]   all that confusion and unnecessary speculation about what our Lord may or may not have done
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.220]   when he was in hell. There is not a word about it in the scriptures. But men have speculated
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:02.700]   on this and have elaborated theories, and it has even crept into the creeds in that
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:08.020]   way, but it has got no scriptural authority. It was a misunderstanding and a misinterpretation
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:15.780]   of this particular portion and 1 Peter 3, 19, etc. Very well.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:21.820]   And oh, how glad I am that we can say all this so that we can concentrate on this amazing
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:28.980]   picture which the Apostle paints here. What is it? Well, it is, if you like, a description
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:36.100]   of the whole movement of salvation. Shall I use a stronger term? The Apostle here is
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:43.620]   describing to us the great drama of salvation. Look at it, he says. I have quoted a verse.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:49.580]   What is it really saying? What it is really saying is this. It is telling us of how our
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:56.460]   Lord has achieved salvation and redemption, and as the mighty victor is now giving gifts
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:04.740]   to his people in the church. The drama of salvation. What is this? Well, let us take
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:13.780]   the terms as the Apostle uses them. Why is there any need of salvation at all?
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:20.180]   And the answer is, there is need of salvation because mankind, in sin, is in a condition
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:27.380]   of slavery. An enemy has come into the world. The devil came in, the enemy of God, pretending
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:34.660]   to be the friend of men. He was man's greatest enemy, and he conquered him. And he has held
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:40.780]   men in bondage and in captivity ever since. Now, there is a great statement of this in
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:46.740]   the epistle to the Hebrews in the second chapter. Let me read you verses 14 and 15.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:52.380]   For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:59.180]   took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.000]   death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.700]   subject to bondage.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:18.140]   Man in sin is a slave of the devil. He is under the dominion of Satan. When this Apostle
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:24.580]   Paul was given the commission on the road to Damascus by the Lord Jesus Christ to preach
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:30.340]   the gospel, he put it to him in these terms. "I send you," he says now, "to the people
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:36.740]   and to the Gentiles to open their eyes and to bring them from darkness to light and from
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:46.580]   the power of Satan unto God." The power of Satan? Here is the arch-enemy. Here is the
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:52.300]   commander of the hosts of hell that has attacked mankind, defeated mankind, and has taken it
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:34:03.820]   away captive. His terrible dominion and power. Not only Satan, sin. Sin is a terrible bondage.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.500]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.120]   People think a life of sin is a life of freedom. It is the greatest slavery in the world. Think
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.800]   of the masses of people in the world today who are slaves to drink and to sex and a thousand
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.380]   and one other things. They talk about their marvelous liberty in life, poor, benighted
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:32.500]   slaves. Let them try to set themselves free. Any one of us who has ever tried to break
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:38.140]   a long-continued, a long-practiced habit knows something about the slavery and the power
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:44.820]   of the bondage of sin, and then the curse of the law, the law of commandments that was
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:49.780]   contrary to us, set against us. Do what you will, you cannot get away from it. The law
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.000]   of God is there, and it is holding you, and it is pronouncing a judgment upon you. There
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.780]   is a condemnation. We are under it, and we cannot escape it. And then death. "The last
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:11.940]   enemy that shall be conquered is death." Here is a mighty enemy that holds mankind,
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:16.940]   as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, in bondage all their lives, the fear of death.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.060]   And Satan is controlling it and frightening us, the tyranny, the bondage, the fear of
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:27.360]   death. How we all hate it, this awful specter that comes nearer and nearer to us. We do
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:34.460]   anything to evade it, but we cannot. The power and the bondage of death. These are the enemies
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:43.300]   that have conquered men. And the Son of God came into this world in order to conquer this
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:50.940]   enemy and in order to set the church free. Christ came to redeem the church. He came
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.080]   to redeem the people out of this bondage, out of this captivity, out of this tyranny.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.820]   He came with that specific object, and he has done it. How has he done it? Listen. "Now
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:10.340]   that he ascended, there he is in glory, seated at the right hand of God this morning. Yes,
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:17.020]   but as I think of him there, I must think of something else." What is it? "But that
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:24.940]   he descended first into the lower parts of the earth. He is in high heaven, yes, but
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:34.100]   he was once on earth. He came down on earth to dwell." I love to tell the story which
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:44.940]   angel voices tell. How once the King of glory came down on earth to dwell. He left the courts
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:50.140]   of heaven. What is it? "But that he first descended," I like his way of putting it.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:58.460]   What is it? Go back over it, he says. The incarnation. "O loving wisdom of our God,
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:06.220]   when all was sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight and to the conflict came." What
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:11.340]   is it? "But that he first descended." How can he leave captivity captive until he comes
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:17.380]   down and deals with the enemy, deals with this captivity? But he has come. He has descended.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:24.380]   Oh, I needn't keep you. You'll find a classic description and elaboration of all this in
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:30.660]   the epistle to the Philippians in the second chapter. Listen to this. "Let this mind be
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:37.780]   in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:44.340]   to be equal with God." He didn't hold on to this equality which he had with God as
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:52.500]   something that he'd never let grow his grasp of it. No, no. Instead of doing that, "he
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:59.380]   made himself of no reputation." Still God, you see, in all his fullness. "But he laid
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:05.580]   aside the signs, the insignia, the marks, the pomp, the glory of it all. He made himself
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:13.900]   of no reputation. He came down incognito. He came down on earth. He took upon himself
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:23.460]   the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. He that ascended, what is
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:29.980]   it but that he first descended? And there it is, he has come from the highest courts
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:37.700]   of heaven to the virgin's womb, to earth, in the form of a man, in the form of a servant,
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:43.980]   with all the poverty and all that characterized that home into which he came. He's descended.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:50.820]   Oh, let your inspired spiritual imaginations have reign, have fling. Look at this drama
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.000]   of redemption. He's come down to meet these enemies that have conquered us, this mighty
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:04.260]   foe that holds us in bondage." Ah, but he didn't stop at that, you remember. "He not
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.020]   only took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men, and being
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:16.820]   found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient." I'll stop there for
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:23.380]   a moment. Because he was very obedient, wasn't he, in the whole of his life? And he came
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.500]   to a fight. Even when he was a babe, King Herod tried to kill him. The devil was using
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.620]   King Herod to try and kill him there. He's in the fight. This is the conflict. The second
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:38.420]   Adam to the fight and to the conflict came. The babe had to fight. Then think of the devil
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:45.140]   tempting him. Think of his obedience to his parents. He became obedient. Though he is
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.220]   the son of God, you remember him there at the age of twelve in the temple, and they
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.180]   didn't know that he was left behind. And they'd gone two days' journey and they find
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.540]   he isn't there. They go back. They say, "What you doing?" He said, "Wisty, not that I must
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.880]   be about my father's business." They didn't understand. Though he knew his father's business,
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.500]   he was obedient to Joseph and Mary. He became obedient. He's doing it for the sake of the
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:12.540]   fight. He submits to baptism, though he's done no wrong and doesn't need to be baptized.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:17.100]   And John tells him so. It's a part of the conflict. He's identifying himself with his
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:23.600]   people. He's going to fight for them. He made himself obedient. Tempted of the devil forty
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:30.800]   days and forty nights in the wilderness. What an attack! There he is in single mortal combat.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.660]   And the Pharisees and the scribes and the Sadducees and the doctors of the law, what
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:41.340]   is it? It's the drama of redemption. It is the fight, the conflict, to deliver his people.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:49.060]   He's come down. He has descended in order to do this. He became obedient. And on and
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:55.340]   on it goes. He never failed. He did his father's will. The terrible moment in the garden comes,
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.340]   and he sees what this is going to mean. And he says, "Father, if it be possible, let this
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:08.460]   cup pass by. But if not, nevertheless not my will, but thine be done." Obedient! Yes,
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:17.460]   obedient unto death. Even the death of the cross. And why did he go there? Well, he went
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.780]   there in order that this victory might be complete. I want to read it again. Colossians
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:29.300]   2.15, "And having spoiled principalities and powers, there they brought out their last
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:35.060]   reserves. The devil thought, if only we can kill him and get rid of him, then we are victorious.
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   But it was as they killed him, he was killing them. He made an open show of them. Having
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:46.580]   spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:53.060]   in it. It is there he defeated the devil and all his hosts finally. And at the same time
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:58.300]   he dealt with the law there, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:07.300]   us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it unto his cross.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:16.820]   But in doing all this, he died and he had to die. And they take down his body and they
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:28.100]   bury it in a grave. Is he defeated? Is he at last defeated? Well, you know the answer,
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:33.340]   thank God, there is no defeat. It is still victory all along the line. He dies, he is
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:38.340]   buried, they roll the stone over the mouth of the grave, and the enemy is triumphant
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:45.220]   and all seems to be well. But he burst us under the bands of death and rose triumphant
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:52.100]   o'er the grave. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:58.180]   have put on immortality, then shall be brought a pastor saying that his written death is
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:05.060]   swallowed up in victory. He has already done it. He has conquered death and the grave so
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:11.180]   that we can say, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" The sting
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:16.540]   of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law, but thanks be unto God which giveth
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:23.620]   us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. He has conquered the last enemy, every one
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:30.500]   of them. Every enemy that has ever enslaved men and kept him in bondage has been routed
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:39.260]   and defeated. And thus, having completed the work, he rises and he ascends again into heaven.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:45.140]   He ascends from the earth. The disciples were with him and they saw him ascending into heaven.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:55.060]   He has passed through the heavens. And notice how the apostle puts it, "He that descended
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:03.060]   is the same also that has ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things."
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:09.220]   What he means, you see, is this. It is because he has done all that that he is where he is.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:15.980]   Paul puts it in Philippians 2 in these words, "Wherefore, because of all this, wherefore
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:23.620]   also God hath highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name, that
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:29.500]   at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things on earth and
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.900]   things under the earth." It is because of what he has done that God puts him in this
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:41.620]   position. Indeed, our Lord said it himself. At the end of Matthew's Gospel you read this,
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:47.540]   he says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and preach the
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   gospel. And lo, I am with you and shall be with you unto the end of the age." All power,
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:01.820]   highest heavens filling all and in all. Go to your book of Revelations. Go to chapter
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:08.860]   5. There is this weeping and wailing. Here is a book with seals on it, the book of history.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:14.220]   And no man is strong enough to tear off the seals. No man is big enough to control history.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:19.740]   There is no one in heaven or on earth. What can we do? It is all right. The Lion of the
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:27.220]   tribe of Judah hath prevailed to open the book. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.260]   Son of God, the one who descended, has done it. He is big enough, he is great enough,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:37.580]   and the book is handed to him and he tears off the seals. He is the Lord of history.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.260]   He is seated at the right hand of God and waiting until all his enemies shall be made
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:49.940]   his footstool. Lord of creation, Lord of history, Lord of everything. Indeed, the Apostle has
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:55.420]   already said it in the first chapter of our epistle. He wants us to know the exceeding
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:02.320]   greatness of God's power to us that believe according to the working of his mighty power,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.700]   which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:14.220]   hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:19.900]   and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come,
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.500]   and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head of the church, to
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:34.220]   over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:42.700]   and in all. Yes, when he ascended upon high, he led captivity captive. He gave gifts to
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.700]   men. Every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Why
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:58.140]   is he in this position? It is because he who thus is ascended and is in that position,
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:08.180]   first descended, came on earth and did this mighty thing and conquered all the enemy and
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:15.460]   the captors and has led them in his triumphal train. And there he is. He has earned the
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:24.300]   right and he is the head of the church and has all power. And thus he gives and dispenses
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:35.260]   these gifts to his people in the church according to the measure that he himself has determined.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:42.540]   I am sure that you all will agree with me at this point in thanking God that the great
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:50.380]   apostle broke off his argument in that way and gave us this amazing exposition and thereby
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:58.340]   gave us this astounding view of the drama of redemption, from heaven to earth, back
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:11.020]   into heaven. But there, remember, he is now different in one sense from what he was before.
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:23.460]   He that ascended is the same also that descended first. He is now God-man. He was God alone
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:29.300]   before, but he has taken our human nature back with him. And the one who is on the throne
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:35.940]   and in the exalted position is touched with a feeling of our infirmity. He carries his
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:42.260]   human nature with him, our nature with him, so that in a sense we are there with him,
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:48.700]   seated with him in the heavenly places. Such is the apostle's picture of Christ as the
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:57.380]   head of the church giving the graces and the gifts to his people in the church, which is
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:08.460]   his own body, the fullness of him that filleth all and in all. Amen.
