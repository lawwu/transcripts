[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Pastor John, I know you're gearing up for the Desiring Guide conference for
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.360]   pastors here in a few weeks in Minneapolis, and you're planning to
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.440]   deliver a biographical sketch this year of poet George Herbert. Is there anything
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.160]   from Herbert's life that you can share with us? Any teasers from your research?
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.440]   I'm very excited about Herbert. I don't know exactly what I'm going to say yet,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.360]   but I am immersed in him these days as I move toward the pastors conference.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.640]   Herbert lived, he was born in 1593, and he didn't live to be 40 years old. He died
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.560]   just short of his 40th year, so he's another one of those saints who didn't live
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.360]   long but had a huge effect. He was born of a wealthy family and went to
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.960]   Cambridge, became the orator at Cambridge, and thus wrote and spoke before King
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.440]   James, who is responsible for the King James Bible, and battled all of his young
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.840]   life with whether he should yield to the ministry, the call of a pastorate, or
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.360]   whether he should aim at a role in the royal court. And that's where a lot of
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.800]   his poems come from, is the soul conflict with honor and pleasure and power on the
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.360]   one hand, and a life utterly devoted to Jesus on the other hand. And that's, I
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   think, why some of his poems are so effective. There were about 184
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.840]   poems, and what's remarkable is that when he was 17, he wrote two sonnets for his
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.120]   mother, who he loved very much, and in those sonnets he pledged himself to
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.280]   write only for the glory of God. So in spite of all this battle with his public
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.600]   life in the years just after Cambridge, he held to that promise. There are
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.480]   no poems from the pen of George Herbert that we know of that don't deal with God
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.000]   or with the soul in relation to God. He's not like John Donne, who half his life or
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.120]   more was spent writing poems of a more secular, natural kind. All of his poems
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.160]   were devoted to God, and so he assembled them in a book that he never
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.920]   published during his lifetime, but was given away. So what I'm going to try to
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.200]   do, that book was given to Nicholas Farrar right after he died, and it was
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.720]   published within seven months after he died, and it went through a lot of
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.960]   editions. What I'm going to try to do is show how God won that victory, and
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.000]   Herbert gave himself over to God and over to the ministry and was a little
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   country pastor in a tiny church called Bremerton for the last three years of
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.560]   his life, and then he died of tuberculosis just short of his 40th birthday, and how
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.880]   his poetry captures that conflict and how poetry figures into this whole issue
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.400]   of brothers, we are still not professionals. That's what I'm constantly
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.800]   looking at when I read him, is how does Herbert represent for us in his
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.880]   conflicts, in his soul, in his finally yielding to God, in his final years of
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.480]   pastoral ministry, how does he represent for us what I'm trying to say by
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.200]   brothers, we are still not professionals. So I'm really eager to take his poetry,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.120]   his life, his ministry, weave them together into a kind of challenge to the
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.360]   pastors along with the others to not be the kind of professional we're talking
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.640]   about. Excellent. Well I'm looking forward to it. February 4, 5, and 6 in
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.440]   Minneapolis, the 2013 Conference for Pastors titled "Brothers, We Are Still Not
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.880]   Professionals." Hope to see you there. Thank you for joining us for this
