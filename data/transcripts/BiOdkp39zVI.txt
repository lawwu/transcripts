[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.560]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the third chapter, reading again verses 12 and
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   13.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.360]   And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:31.080]   this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.920]   made these men to walk?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.200]   The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.720]   Son Jesus.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.840]   And then he goes on to remind them how they delivered him up when Pilate wanted to set
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.160]   him free.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.200]   He reminds them that they denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.640]   be granted to them, that they killed the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.240]   whereof we are witnesses, he says.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.880]   And his name, through faith in his name, hath made these men strong, whom ye see and know;
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.600]   yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   of you all.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.120]   In other words, I want to consider with you tonight this sermon that was preached here
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.240]   by the Apostle Peter.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.740]   Now, you remember the occasion which led the Apostle to preach this sermon.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.240]   It was the immediate and the direct result of the healing of that lame man at the beautiful
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.580]   gate of the temple.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.300]   We were considering the miracle itself last Sunday night, how Peter and John were going
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.440]   up to the temple to pray at the hour of prayer, and suddenly they saw this man who was laid
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.400]   daily at the gate of the temple, which is called beautiful, to ask alms of them that
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.160]   entered into the temple.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.600]   You remember how the men, seeing Peter and John, asked alms of them.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.400]   But Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, "Look on us."
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120]   And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.320]   Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have, give I thee, in
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.880]   the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.160]   Rise up and walk."
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.920]   And Peter gave him his hand and took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.800]   his feet and ankle bones received strength.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.640]   We left these men last Sunday night going into the temple, walking and leaping and praising
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   God.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.760]   Well, now, this, of course, led to great excitement.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.960]   They knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple, and they
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.200]   were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.960]   And as the laymen which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.680]   them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.960]   And then Peter begins to preach to them.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.240]   When Peter saw it, he answered unto the people.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.000]   And then we are given the account of the sermon, which goes on to the very end of the chapter.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.880]   Now this, again, is a most important matter.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.760]   We have already been looking at the sermon preached by Peter on the day of Pentecost
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.240]   as it is recorded in the second chapter of this book of Acts.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.580]   And here we are looking at his next sermon.
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.640]   Now this is all important for us for this reason, that here we are face to face with
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   the authentic Christian message.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.560]   That is what we are considering.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.360]   This which the world needs tonight above everything else, the Christian message.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.760]   World in trouble, the world in confusion, the world in pain, the world playing with
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.640]   war, the world fumbling with powers that it does not understand, the world a tragedy.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.120]   What it needs above everything else is this message, the Christian message, the message
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.800]   of the Christian church.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.720]   And again I would remind you that the tragedy of the hour is the greatest tragedy of all,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.520]   that there is such confusion about this.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   What is it?
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.420]   It is not surprising that the world is in confusion about this.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.240]   So many different things are being said to it.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.200]   Now my whole contention is this, that there is only one way whereby we can discover what
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.160]   the authentic Christian message is, and that is to go back to the origin of the Christian
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.360]   church.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.240]   This is where she comes into being, this is the start.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.480]   What right have we to say what the church is?
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.880]   This is the only authoritative statement.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.520]   And as I am never tired of repeating, every great revival in the history of the church
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.200]   is just a return to this, this is the true, authentic message.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.380]   Here we really see what the Christian church is, and we are shown this in different ways.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.360]   We see the church in action, we see apostles working miracles, we see that the miracle
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:22.040]   in itself becomes a parable, but here now we have the sermon of the apostle Peter.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.720]   You see the crowd gathered and they wanted to know what all this was.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.360]   Peter takes advantage of the opportunity and he tells them.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.000]   In other words, he explains to them what this new thing that has come into being is, namely
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.560]   the Christian church, and what its message is.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.920]   Now I want to consider this with you this evening.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.120]   That is what is so wonderful about the scriptures you see, you get your picture, you get your
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.960]   dramatic incident, and then you get explanation, you get sermon, teaching.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   We need both.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.120]   Now, here are the principles which, it seems to me, stand out on the very surface of this.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.600]   What I really want to do is to deal with it in general tonight.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.760]   It's such a wealthy sermon, it's an amazing sermon.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.040]   Of course, this is only a synopsis that we have here.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.080]   This is the essence of the message.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.760]   The total sermon undoubtedly was much longer, but what we have here are the synopses of
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.040]   these great sermons preached by the apostles at the beginning.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   What's the teaching?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.400]   Well, here's the first great principle that I find here.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.200]   Christianity is a phenomenon.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   Well, I mean this.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.680]   It is not primarily nor essentially a teaching only.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.320]   There is teaching here, of course, that's what the sermon is, this is teaching.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   But primarily and essentially, it is not a teaching.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.120]   It is more than a teaching.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.560]   It is a phenomenon.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.120]   Christianity is essentially something that happens, something that has happened, something
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.720]   that is happening, something that's going to happen.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.320]   Again, I take you back to the first chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.160]   The former treatise of Imado Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.420]   until the day in which he was taken up after that he, through the Holy Ghost, had given
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:28.240]   commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen, there says Luke, I've already told you of
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.800]   all that he began to do, I'm now going to tell you what he continued to do and what
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.920]   he's yet going to do.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.640]   Now, here it is once more.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   Christianity, I say, is primarily and essentially a phenomenon.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.080]   It's something that happens and takes place and attracts attention.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:54.720]   Now, that, of course, is the thing that stands out here on the very surface.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.920]   We see here that the crowd gathered together.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.520]   We are told about them that they were filled with wonder and amazement.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.640]   It's repeated that they came greatly wondering.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.080]   We've seen exactly the same thing in the second chapter.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.400]   When the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles and the others, they were all filled with
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.220]   the Holy Ghost and they began to speak with other tongues.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.080]   And we are told that there were devout people gathered together from different parts of
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.960]   the world in Jerusalem at the time, and they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:35.840]   another because that every one, every man heard them speak in their own language.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.200]   They were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, "What meaneth this?"
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.440]   Now, that's what I mean by a phenomenon.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   That's how Christianity began.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   Something happened.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:52.320]   It isn't just a teaching, but it's something taking place, something that attracts attention,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.880]   something that causes people to be filled with a sense of wonder and amazement that
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.280]   makes people marvel.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.240]   Now, this, to me, is the point which so many miss at the present time.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.280]   This is one of the most grievous and most fatal misunderstandings of the Christian message
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.680]   and the whole purpose of the Christian gospel.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:23.560]   Men forever are reducing it to just a teaching, you know, moral teaching, ethical teaching,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:31.040]   political teaching, or still, perhaps more serious, a kind of religious teaching.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.360]   And Christianity is just reduced to one of the great teachings of the world, so that
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.920]   people put it into series with the so-called great world religions, Confucianism, Buddhism,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.800]   Mohammedanism, and so on.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.520]   Now, those religions are nothing but teachings.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.720]   That's all they are.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.920]   They don't claim to be anything else.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.520]   They are teachings with regard to men and how we should live.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.840]   Just teachings.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   Nothing else.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.920]   They're a kind of philosophies which take a religious form.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   And the danger always is that people put the Christian faith into that kind of category,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.960]   into that kind of series, and the whole thing is reduced to just a teaching, a point of
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.560]   view, an attitude with regard to life, something that tells us how to view life and how to
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   live life.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   And there it is.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.800]   It's just a teaching amongst a number of other teachings.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.600]   Now, I say that here at the very beginning we are reminded that that isn't true.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.080]   There is something that puts this into a category on its own.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   What's that?
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:39.840]   Well, that it is historical, that it is phenomenal, that it is primarily something that's done,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.400]   and then the teaching which explains what it is that has happened.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:53.160]   I read to you at the beginning that extraordinary passage from the third chapter of the book
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   of Exodus, because that, again, in a very wonderful and dramatic manner, makes this
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   same point.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.320]   You see, what I'm saying is not only true of the New Testament, it is equally true of
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.040]   the Old Testament.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   This is a book of history, primarily.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.120]   It tells us of things that have happened, and here it is in typical form.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.000]   If you want to know what it is, well, go back and look at that picture there of Moses.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.640]   He had to escape from Egypt, you remember?
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.560]   And there he was just earning his living as a shepherd, and he did that for forty years
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   in that land of Midian.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.040]   And there he was, doing the same thing every day, more or less, guiding this flock of sheep
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.840]   to fresh pasture, leading them from here to there, and on this occasion he was doing exactly
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   the same thing.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.200]   He'd done it so often, as I say, he did it for forty years.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.320]   And no doubt he was feeling quite hopeless, had stopped thinking perhaps about his people
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.880]   in the land of Egypt from whom he'd had to flee, he'd forgotten all about his great
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.080]   days when he'd been brought up as the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and all the glittering
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.480]   prizes that were dangling themselves before him, all that was past history, they'd gone.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.560]   He was just a shepherdman and tending to the sheep as every other shepherd was doing.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   So he took the sheep that afternoon to that backside of that wilderness near that Mount
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   Horeb, and suddenly he's arrested.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.680]   See, he didn't sit down, as it were, and read a book, or teaching.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.440]   It wasn't that he sat down and began to think and to meditate and to ruminate about
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.880]   life and to try and see if he could draw up a plan of living and a philosophy of existence.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.720]   Not at all.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.280]   In the midst of the most ordinary of occasion, conceivables, suddenly he's confronted by
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   something.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.280]   What a phenomenon.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.640]   A burning bush, a bush burning and yet not being consumed, and he says, "I will turn
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.760]   aside and see this great sight," he's about to invest it.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:10.400]   When the voice comes and he's arrested, something is said to him, it's a phenomenon.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.200]   It's a meeting with God.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:18.720]   Now, here, I say, is the great thing that stands out, likewise, at the very beginning
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.240]   of the Christian era.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.080]   We must get rid of this old notion of a kind of abstract teaching or a theoretical teaching
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   or an academic teaching.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.520]   Oh, it can never be said so frequently to an age like the present one that bursts of
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.920]   its intelligence and its learning, this is not philosophy.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:47.120]   Indeed, the greatest enemy of this is philosophy, whatever form it may change to take, whether
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.760]   it's the formal philosophy of the schools and of the books, or whether it's the pseudo-philosophy
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   of the newspapers, and the weekly papers, and the journals, and all the cleverness of
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.480]   modern men this has gotten.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.840]   Nothing to do with it.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.160]   This is a phenomenon.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   This is something that happens.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.040]   This is something that confronts us.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.960]   This is something that's there facing us.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.840]   Now, that's why the people came together.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.720]   The phenomenon of the miracle, the man healed, as before, on the day of Pentecost.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:25.800]   It was the phenomenon of the baptism with the Holy Ghost, and the strange results produced
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.160]   in these apostles and in others.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.320]   My friends, has it ever come to you as a phenomenon?
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.960]   If it hasn't, you know nothing about it.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.280]   You can take a theoretical interest in Christianity, many people do.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.440]   God forgive me, I did that for many years, a mere intellectual interest in it, and it
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.680]   can be very fascinating as that, but that's not the real thing.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.920]   One becomes a true Christian when one is confronted by something which is a phenomenon, something
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.280]   arresting, something shaking, something moving, something inexplicable.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.760]   Now, here is the first thing that strikes us at once.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.680]   And of course this is, as I say, the very essence of the message.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:17.200]   The Christian Church herself is a phenomenon, and she is a phenomenon that has baffled the
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.800]   ages and the centuries.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.040]   She is baffling this present age.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.120]   Why does she still exist at all?
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.080]   Why does she still go on when so many other institutions have come and gone?
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   What is this?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.560]   Well, I'll tell you in a sense what it is.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.600]   This is something that changes the lives of men.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.680]   This is something that produces saints.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.720]   This is a series of phenomena.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.840]   You read this book of the Acts of the Apostles, read the history as far as it is known in
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.960]   the early centuries, and this is what you find.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.800]   There was something about these Christian people that not only could nobody understand
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.960]   but that nobody could put a stop to.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.760]   The Jews tried to put a stop to it.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.160]   The Romans did their best to put a stop to it.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.520]   There were grievous persecutions.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.200]   The Church was repeatedly driven underground, and yet she still went on.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.280]   They murdered them, they tried to murder all the leaders, but as we are reminded, the blood
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:27.440]   of the martyrs was the seed of the Church, a phenomenon, and it's always been a phenomenon.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:35.520]   Jesus of Nazareth, carpenter, born in poverty, and he stands up and teaches, arrests attention.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.720]   He dies, he rises again.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.920]   He that despised Galilean has conquered the centuries.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   He stands alone.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:49.240]   This is a great phenomenon, and as I say, his people are very unworthy often, but then
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.600]   you see these phenomena appear, revivals, life coming into a moribund Church.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.880]   Suddenly she stands on her feet again and speaks with authority.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.840]   Men and women's lives are changed.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.920]   Oh, I could keep you in telling you some of these great stories as they've taken place
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.760]   throughout the running centuries, and this is true Christianity.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:22.240]   You know about 230 years ago, the conditions in this country were, if anything, even worse
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   than they are today, morally and religiously.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.680]   Have you ever read a book called England Before and After Wesley?
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.720]   Well, if you read it, you'll see what the condition of this country was.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:42.520]   Degradation and vice and sin, the gin shops here in London, how you could get drunk if
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   I remember rightly.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   What was it?
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   For a ha'penny or a penny.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.120]   If you paid just a little extra, you were given the straws well in which to lie in your
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   drunkenness and to recover.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:58.300]   Devil worship rampant and all that was characteristic of that Hanoverian period.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.840]   But then you see something happened.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.840]   A phenomenon took place, and the face of England was changed, a mighty revival, and men and
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.920]   women were taken up out of the degradation and the gutters of life and were washed and
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.560]   cleansed and changed, became new men and women.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.000]   And indeed, you can't explain the history of the 19th century nor this present century
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.280]   except in the light of that phenomenon.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.720]   All happened through the Christian Church.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.520]   Well now, here is the first great thing you see that stands out on the surface.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.760]   All the people saw him walking and leaping and praising God.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.960]   And they knew that it was he which set for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   They were filled with wonder and amazement.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:46.160]   And as the lay men, which was healed, held Peter and John, what it means is, you know,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.600]   he was so delighted and so amazed and so thrilled by the fact that he could walk and leap and
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   praise God.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.520]   He was embracing them, he wouldn't let them go.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.120]   All the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's Greatly Wandering.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:08.540]   Very well, I must leave that, but let me leave it with a question.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.720]   Have you ever been arrested like that by the Christian message?
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.600]   What do you feel, to use the modern language that you've got it taped, that you understand
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   the whole thing?
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.200]   Have you been confronted by something that pulls you out?
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.240]   That's the first step, as it were, always in becoming Christian.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.920]   Now then, let's listen to what Peter says to all this.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.940]   What is his reaction?
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:36.100]   He is the mouthpiece of God on this occasion.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.580]   Now it's very interesting to notice what he didn't say.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.480]   I'm sorry, but I've got to start with the negative again.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:50.080]   There is such a grievous misunderstanding of Christianity that we've got to say what
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   it doesn't say.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.800]   You would have thought that this was a wonderful opportunity for Peter to preach about miracles,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.560]   to offer to heal others.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.440]   One man's just been healed, anybody else want to be healed, come along.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.680]   What a wonderful opportunity.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   He doesn't do that.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.240]   But that often passes as Christianity.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:19.640]   People are offered this and that, physical healing, friendship, guidance, experiences
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.640]   of different kinds.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.800]   My dear friends, that's not Christianity.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.240]   Christianity does things like that, it doesn't preach them.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.680]   That's what the cults do.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.320]   That's precisely the very method of the cults, isn't it?
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.680]   They come to you and say, what's your trouble, how are you feeling, come along, we can put
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   you right.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.700]   Christianity doesn't do that, as I'm going to show you.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.360]   But Christianity's so often been turned into one of the cults.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.400]   And the church in her folly, because she went to attract people, has presented herself in
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.880]   the guise of a cult.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   That isn't what Peter did, and I mustn't do it.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.920]   No, no, he didn't do anything of that kind.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   Well what did he do?
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.760]   Well, what Peter did was this.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.920]   He gave the explanation of the miracle.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.160]   He dealt with what had happened.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.440]   And he showed the significance of that which had happened.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.280]   That's what Peter did.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.640]   He didn't, again, to use the modern language, cash in on what had happened.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.400]   No, no, he does the exact opposite.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.040]   He said, you look here, you're looking and you're marveling and looking at us, I want
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   to tell you.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   He gives an explanation, and he shows the significance of what it is that has happened.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.280]   Well now then, what is this?
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.600]   Well again, my business tonight is just to expound the Apostle's Sermon.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.920]   I'm not preaching a sermon of my own, I'm preaching Peter's sermon, and here it is.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   This is how he began.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.160]   "You men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:49.000]   Oh, why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.120]   man to walk?"
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:59.160]   Now there you see, he starts with the wrong explanation of this phenomenon.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.240]   He says, "I'm amazed to start with at the fact that you are surprised at this.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.020]   Why do you marvel at this?
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   You shouldn't.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.920]   If you understood things as you ought to, you wouldn't be marveling at this.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.760]   Still this, would you be looking at us, at my friend John here and myself, as if we by
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.040]   our own power or holiness had enabled this man to walk?
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.040]   What's he mean by this?"
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.340]   Well, you see, what he's doing is this.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.320]   Peter understood the congregation to which he was preaching, and he knew that their greatest
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.720]   danger was to regard him and John as a kind of miracle men.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.800]   There were people like that in the ancient world.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   They were magicians.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.380]   That's what they're called.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.280]   You read about the magicians in Egypt, and there were other magicians.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.160]   As you go on with this book of the Acts of the Apostles, you'll come to a magician in
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   some area.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.940]   You'll come to another one called Bar-Jesus in the thirteenth chapter of this book of
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940]   Acts.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:05.100]   There were men like that, men, clever men, men who were regarded as seers, men who were
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:11.220]   regarded as strange and extraordinary in that they had some curious powers whereby they
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.440]   were able to treat people and heal their diseases or to charm away a curse that had been put
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   upon them.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.760]   Now, that kind of thing has been very common, not only in the East, but it was very common
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   in this country.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.700]   I even remember the relics of that kind of thing.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:32.160]   I remember a man in a certain district, everybody referred to him as "the wise man."
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.780]   People used to go to him.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:39.560]   They believed, you know, in those days that suddenly a farmer would find that his cream
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.800]   kept on turning sour, or the milk kept turning sour when it shouldn't do, and they believed
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.440]   that somebody put a curse on them, and what could they do about it?
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.200]   Ah, they went to the wise man, this man with understanding of books, and he had certain
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.560]   signs, and they went to him and they paid him a fee, and he would give them a message.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.880]   He'd sometimes make them write it on a bit of paper and then fold it up and sew it inside
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.160]   their shirt or something, and they were not to look at it for a given number of days,
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.760]   and that would act as a charm, and the curse would be dispelled, and all would be well
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   with them.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.060]   Now, that kind of thing was rampant in the ancient world.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:21.400]   And Peter recognizes this at once, and he says, "You know, we are not miracle workers.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.160]   We haven't got some strange power, such as these other people claim to have.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   It isn't that.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   You mustn't explain it like that."
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:34.040]   "Neither," he says, "must you attribute it to some extraordinary piety on our part,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:40.940]   our own power or holiness or godliness, unusual degree of piety.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.800]   It isn't that," says Peter.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.480]   "Indeed," he says, "in a sense it's got nothing to do with us at all.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.240]   You don't explain it in anything that is in us."
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.360]   He's anxious to make that clear.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.880]   And it's equally necessary that it should be clear at the present time.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:06.440]   You can't explain what happens to people when they become Christians in any human terms.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.320]   No man can make another man a Christian.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.800]   People foolishly talk about being so-and-so's convert.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.720]   What a ridiculous thing it is.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.520]   No man has ever converted another.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.940]   Oh, men can persuade one another, I know, of course.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.000]   Men have persuaded others to join churches, but that doesn't mean conversion.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.360]   Men can't change a soul, he can't regenerate a soul, he can't give life to somebody who's
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   dead spiritually.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.000]   That's what makes a man a Christian.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   No man can do that.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.680]   Men can be used as instruments, as Peter and John were, as Paul was, as the great preachers
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.960]   of the centuries have been.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.880]   But they've been nothing but instruments, and they don't want personal followers, and
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.400]   they're not interested in that.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.920]   They say it isn't that, and they do nothing to advertise themselves per se.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.280]   They keep out of sight, "Oh, it's not us, don't look at us!"
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.580]   It isn't us, nor our own power, nor holiness, that has enabled this man to walk.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.520]   And in the same way, it's made equally clear that it is not something that is taught to
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.320]   the man which he's now got to apply.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.800]   You know the sort of thing I mean.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.200]   The cults again, psychology, coercion.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.120]   You see, here's a man who's finding trouble in walking, there's nothing really wrong with
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.000]   him, it's imaginary, functional.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And what do you do with him?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.760]   Well, you say to him, "Look here, if you do what I tell you, you'll soon get rid of this
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.920]   difficulty in walking.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.440]   Say to yourself every day and in every way, 'I'm getting better and better.'
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.160]   Repeat the formula, go on repeating it.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   Suggest it to yourself."
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.280]   And he suddenly finds he's all right.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.440]   Something like that here, my friends, that isn't Christianity.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:50.760]   Psychology, I verily suggest to you, as philosophy, is one of the greatest enemies of Christianity.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.040]   No, no, it isn't the formula that you apply.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   What is it?
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.680]   "Well," says Peter, "it's something that's happened to the man.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.640]   See, it's happened, it happened quickly, immediately.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.080]   It's not a course of treatment, it is an action.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.240]   His faith, his name through faith in his name, has given him this perfect soundness in the
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.920]   presence of you all."
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.560]   You see, this is in an entirely different category.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:22.080]   Very well, there Peter has told them what is the wrong or the false explanation of what
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.920]   has taken place to this man.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.800]   That's not the explanation of the phenomenon.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   What is it then?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.320]   Well, now then, here it is.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.800]   I want to ask you a question.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.360]   As I read this to you at the beginning, as you've read it to yourselves perhaps at home,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:45.920]   hasn't this sermon come as a bit of a surprise to you?
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   Look at it.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   Here it is.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.740]   Here's the man who's been healed, walking, leaping, praising God, holding on to the apostles
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.080]   and embracing them, and the crowd gathers.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.320]   What is this marvel and amazement and astonishment?
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.800]   Haven't you been rather surprised at what Peter said?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.080]   Listen, this is what he said.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.480]   "You men of Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.480]   by our own power or holiness we had made these men to walk?"
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:17.840]   And listen, "The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:24.000]   our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.880]   Now, here is the very essence of the whole matter.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:38.320]   This I say is one of the most surprising and astonishing things to the natural men.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   Why is it surprising?
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.960]   Well, it's surprising for these reasons.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.320]   What Peter is really telling them is this.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.000]   He says, "You know, you're concentrating on the wrong thing.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.080]   It isn't the miracle, qua miracle, that is important.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.640]   The vital thing is that to which it points."
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.480]   You see, mankind in its cleverness is always interested in the phenomena, isn't it?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.840]   And these people came rushing together, which is wonderful.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.760]   You can always get a crowd if you produce some kind of a phenomenon, and they rush,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.840]   and they want to understand, they want to investigate.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.160]   Now, you notice that was the very thing that Moses was tempted to do, and indeed he was
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   beginning to do it.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.000]   Here he is, leading his sheep, suddenly he sees the phenomena, and he was a very able
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   man, Moses, and he'd been trained, of course, in Egypt, you see, and he knew something about
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.280]   the magicians and all the lore and the learning of the ancient Egyptians, and it was very
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   considerable.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   It was a great civilization.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.160]   And Moses, with the science of those days, says, "Ah, I shall turn aside, I'm going
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.640]   to investigate this phenomena."
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.360]   Out comes the voice, "Stand back!
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:54.640]   Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground."
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.600]   The phenomenon is a phenomenon, yes, but not for our investigation.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.840]   It isn't for our detached, academic, scientific investigation.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.960]   "Oh, yes, I'll get out a book out of the library on Christianity, now I've read
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.960]   the others.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.960]   I want to evaluate."
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.920]   Oh, my dear friend, if you continue like that, you'll never become a Christian.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.600]   "Take off your shoes from off your feet, the ground whereon you're standing is holy
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   ground."
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   It isn't a phenomenon qua phenomenon.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:27.320]   It's the matter which it points.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:37.160]   Let me say again, then, that it is not a matter merely for theoretical consideration.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:42.080]   And if you haven't felt something of the awe and the amazement and the wonder, I say
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.440]   you haven't even started yet.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:51.200]   Peter, you see, doesn't give him a disquisition on miracles, that's what the modern man
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   likes.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   Is a miracle possible?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.640]   Is it possible for the modern scientific men in the sixties of the twentieth century any
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.480]   longer to believe in the supernatural and the miraculous?
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.280]   And you have your great debates.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.960]   Can an educated scientific man believe in miracles?
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.960]   What are miracles?
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.080]   And we are tremendously intrigued and interested.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.240]   Peter didn't preach on miracles, of course he didn't.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.000]   The Bible doesn't defend miracles, it's a record of them.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.080]   It just tells you that they've happened.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.280]   It confronts you by them.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.400]   And as long as you think that with your understanding you can understand a miracle, you haven't
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   started.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   You're right outside.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.320]   You've got to take your shoes off your feet, you've got to be humble, you've got to
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   become as a little child.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.760]   No, no, Peter doesn't preach on miracles, he doesn't attempt to give explanation.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.360]   He says, "Look at this, yes, but what's it point to?
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.080]   That's the thing that matters.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:50.040]   And indeed I must go even further, and this is to me in many ways the most astonishing
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.360]   thing of all."
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.640]   Peter's sermon does not even start with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.760]   Now, have you ever been pulled up by that?
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.800]   Here he is, he's healed the man in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, yet when the
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.920]   people say, "What is this?"
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.200]   Peter's answer is, "The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob."
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.600]   He doesn't start with Jesus.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.800]   I speak carefully because I know I'm liable to be misunderstood at this point, but this
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   to me is a very vital part of Christian teaching and of the Christian message.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.960]   You don't start even with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.440]   I'm not at all sure, but that most of our troubles in the Christian Church today are
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.540]   just due to that.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.640]   We start with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   We mustn't.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.880]   Where do you start?
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.200]   You start with God.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.040]   You start with the whole message of the Bible.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.840]   There is a modern conception of evangelism which regards it as just saying to people,
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   "Come to Jesus."
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.720]   They say, "You needn't talk to them about repentance.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.240]   Just invite them to come to Jesus.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.240]   They're in trouble.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   They're unhappy.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.240]   Tell them to come to Jesus.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.840]   You start with him and you end with him."
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.680]   My friends, that is not Christian preaching.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.200]   Here's Christian preaching.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.960]   Here is this tremendous apostle and he's preaching with a miracle that has just taken
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   place.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   And do you notice how he starts, "God!
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.640]   The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob."
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   What do I mean?
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.280]   Well, what I mean, you see, is this.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.360]   This is how all these apostles preach.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   You will find the apostle Paul did exactly the same thing.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:53.640]   There's an account of him in this 14th chapter in a place called Lystra.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:01.800]   And there he healed a certain man again who was lame.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:08.520]   And again the people were so carried away by this that they began to worship Paul and
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.920]   Barnabas.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:18.000]   And they called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul Mercurius, the high priest of Jupiter, which
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.400]   was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.560]   with the people, which when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their clothes
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.400]   and ran in among the people, crying out and saying, "Sirs, why do ye these things?
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   We also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you."
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   What?
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:44.200]   That you should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.000]   and the sea and all things that are therein and so on.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.320]   That's Christian preaching.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.140]   You don't even start with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.080]   You know there is a danger that people turn even the Lord Jesus Christ into some kind
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.840]   of miracle worker.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:04.400]   No, no, you start, as Peter started here, with the whole message of the Bible.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   What's it mean?
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   Well, it's this, you see.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.840]   This is the first step in Christian preaching.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:22.080]   Man and all his problems must always be considered in his relationship to God.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.480]   That's the whole message of the Bible.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.120]   You don't start with particular problems.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.960]   You start with men as he is, men in this world.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.240]   How do you understand him?
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.380]   In his relationship to God.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.960]   So that when they come together because of a miracle or anything else, you don't talk
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.080]   about the miracle.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.840]   You don't even talk about the Son of God.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.040]   You talk about God and men.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:54.520]   Yes, but you notice that Peter does that in a very special way and manner.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.920]   The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.080]   Why do you think he said that?
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.280]   Ah, this is the very essence of the matter.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:12.820]   Have you ever read the great experience that came into the life of that brilliant mathematician
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.920]   Blaise Pascal?
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.540]   It's generally agreed that he probably is the greatest mathematician of all time, brilliant
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:29.840]   philosopher also, a genius in every sense, living in France in the 17th century.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.280]   But not only a great scientist, but a godly man and a man who was seeking God.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.480]   And he tells us of a great experience that came to him, an overwhelming experience of
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   God.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:47.280]   And he wrote down, and this is what he wrote, "God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.000]   - not of the philosophers."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.800]   That's it.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.760]   He was a philosopher, remember, and a very able and a very learned philosopher.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:07.520]   But he says, "I admit, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob - not of the philosophers."
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.520]   What's he mean by this?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:15.480]   Oh, I sometimes think that this is the greatest lesson needed by this world of ours in 1965.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:21.280]   Our trouble, my dear friends, is that we don't know God.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.160]   That's our first need.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.280]   Not the God of the philosophers, not the God of speculation.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.520]   Oh, there are clever people writing books about God.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.840]   At the present time, you're familiar with them, Honest to God, Down to Earth, New Reformation,
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   all these clever books.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   And what are they?
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.720]   Well, they're nothing but speculation.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   What's God?
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:51.120]   Well, they say he's ultimate reality, he's the ground of all being, he is the uncaused
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   cause.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:02.800]   That's their description of God - terms, concepts, ideas.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.040]   And that is how they think of him and speak about him.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.160]   That's the God of the philosophers.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.120]   That's not the God the Apostle Peter preached.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   No, no.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:19.160]   God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, the God of our fathers.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.080]   "Listen," says Peter, "what's he mean?"
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:31.680]   Well, what he's saying is this, "Peter's God is a living God, and he's a personal God."
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.920]   That's the thing they're writing against today, isn't it?
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.700]   They laugh at us.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.760]   They say, "You think of God as some old man up in the heavens.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.680]   You describe as God up there or out there."
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.720]   No, that's wrong, that's primitive, that's childish.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.160]   God isn't personal.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.120]   Where there's love, that's God.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.480]   Where there's kindness, that's God.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.840]   As I say, the ground of all being, ultimate reality, out upon the suggestion.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.560]   Thank God that that's a lie.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.560]   It's false.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.560]   No, no.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:11.120]   God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   What does this tell us?
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.880]   Well, it tells us that he's personal.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.880]   He is living.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.600]   God isn't an abstraction.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.880]   God is not a number of theories or of categories or of concepts.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:33.000]   God is eternally different from all that, and entirely unlike the false gods of paganism.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.680]   They made their gods out of wood or stone or silver or gold, and they carved them in
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.120]   the likeness of a man or a beast, and then they erected a temple around them, and they
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.080]   worshipped them, and they took their oblations to them.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   But there's nothing there.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   There's no life.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   There's no reality.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.080]   There's no power.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   They're vanities.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   They're lies.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   They're emptiness.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.920]   But God, he's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   What is he?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.320]   Well, he's the God who says, "I am.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   I am that I am."
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.220]   He's a living God.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.680]   He is a personal God.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.320]   He speaks as a person.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:21.800]   He says, "I am that I am."
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.120]   But you see, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.240]   This means that he is the God who has created the universe.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.040]   This is the God of the Bible.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.720]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that in
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:50.680]   them is, a God who acts, a God who does things, a God who plans, who thinks, who orders, the
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:58.920]   everlasting, eternal creator of the universe.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:05.060]   But thank God this term used by Peter tells us something much more precious for us, something
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.680]   much more wonderful.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.720]   He's a God who reveals himself.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.760]   He's a God who appeared unto Abraham when he dwelt in paganism in Ur of the Chaldeas,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.160]   and he spoke to him and he called him out.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.760]   He's a God who reveals himself.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   The philosophers can never find him.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.880]   They've been trying to from the beginning, but the world by wisdom knew not God, says
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   Paul.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.840]   You see, the philosophers can't arrive at God.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.520]   They can come to a point at which they may say, the more intelligent of them, there must
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.680]   be a God, but they can't get further.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   They can't arrive at him, because by definition, they can't, he's inscrutable, he's eternal,
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.120]   he's everlasting, he is infinite in every respect.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:42:01.200]   Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible, hid from our eyes, most blessed,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:08.360]   most glorious, the ancient of days, pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:14.560]   What man can arrive at him, or any knowledge of him, of course he can't.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:20.720]   But the whole message of this book is to say that God is a God who reveals himself.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.520]   There wouldn't be a Bible but for that.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.020]   There wouldn't be the history of the Jews but for that.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.480]   There would be none of the Christian history but for that.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.640]   This man would not have been healed at the beautiful gate of the temple, but for that.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.560]   He's a God who reveals himself.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:39.680]   He makes himself known and all we know about him is what he has revealed.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.800]   God of Abraham, he appeared to Abraham, he appeared to Isaac.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:51.680]   Do you remember Jacob running away from his brother Esau to save his life?
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.760]   Tired at the end of the day, he feels he can't go on another step.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   He goes to lie down.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   There's no bed there.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   What can he do?
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.640]   He gathered some stones together and he made them a pillar for himself and he put his head
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:08.200]   down and suddenly he gets this amazing dream and vision with a ladder from earth to heaven
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.320]   and heaven to earth and angels coming up and down.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.240]   And he wakes up and he says, "This is the house of God.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.640]   This is the gateway of heaven."
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.840]   God spoke to him, revealed himself to him.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.920]   That's the God of the Bible, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, the God who reveals
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:30.680]   himself, not someone whom we arrive at with all our great ability and knowledge and science
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   and understanding.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.680]   No, no.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   No man can ever do it.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:39.240]   But he, in his infinite grace and kindness, draws back the veil and gives us a revelation
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   of himself.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.840]   Let me go further.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:50.600]   God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, yes, he's a God who can be known.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.800]   He's a God who can be spoken to.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.420]   Read the story of Abraham, Isaac and of Jacob.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.500]   Look at them when they're in trouble and in difficulties and they don't know what to do
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.520]   and everybody's against them.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.520]   What do they do?
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   Thank God.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.880]   They can turn to him and speak to him.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.560]   He's a God who can be known.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.520]   He's a God to whom you can speak.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.600]   He's a God to whom you can pray.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.280]   When all things seem against me to drive me to despair, I know one gate is open, one heir
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.720]   will hear my prayer.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.080]   He's a living God.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.800]   He's a personal God.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.280]   He can be known.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.520]   He can be spoken to.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.000]   He can be prayed to.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.240]   You can have fellowship and communion with him.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.400]   You can address him.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.520]   You can listen to him.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:46.080]   God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, oh, still more wonderful.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:55.480]   Though he is so high and great and lofty and eternal, he's a God who is concerned about
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:00.800]   the state of this world.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.220]   That is something that he keeps on making plain and clear to us.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.280]   He made the world, it belongs to him, but men in his folly have sinned against him and
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.680]   rebelled against him and brought chaos down upon himself.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   What's Christianity?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.480]   Oh, I'll tell you what Christianity is.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.600]   It's this.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.200]   It's the message that tells you that God is interested, that God is concerned, that God
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.520]   is determined to do something about it.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.800]   There wouldn't be a Christian message but for that.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.280]   So you don't start even with Jesus Christ.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:36.900]   You start with God, who before the foundation of the world thought out a plan of redemption.
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:44.580]   God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.900]   And this is the most comforting and consoling fact in the world tonight, that the great
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.860]   and eternal God is interested.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.540]   That those statesmen fail, having done their best and though the clever men propound their
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:04.500]   theories but don't help us, and though civilization advances but immorality increases, that all
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.860]   is not lost and all is not hopeless.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.140]   That the everlasting God is concerned.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.620]   Did you notice those wonderful words that we read at the beginning out of this third
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.620]   chapter of Exodus?
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.620]   Listen to this.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.220]   "This eternal God who says to Moses, 'Don't examine me, stand back, take your shoes from
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.220]   off your feet.'
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.860]   He said, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.860]   God of Jacob.'
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.740]   And Moses hid his face, I hope you have.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.740]   He was afraid to look upon God."
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.220]   Have you ever known the fear of God?
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.660]   You'll never know his salvation until you have.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:47.660]   Then he goes on, "The Lord said, 'I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:55.060]   in Egypt, and I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, and this blessed phrase,
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:00.180]   'I know their sorrows, I know their sorrows.'
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:08.300]   And it's my privilege to tell you tonight that God knows your sorrows."
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.300]   How do I know that?
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.100]   I know it for this reason.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:16.820]   God so loved the world as it is in its sorrow and pain and misery.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.060]   God knows our sorrows.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.940]   He knows them so much that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:28.820]   He put it like this to Moses, "I am come down to deliver them out of the land of the Egyptians,
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:33.580]   and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and large, and to a land flowing
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   with milk and honey."
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:41.220]   Oh yes, he's the living God.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.980]   He's the only true God.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.940]   He's a personal God, he's interested, he's concerned, he erupts into the world and its
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.940]   affairs.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:55.940]   He intervenes, he comes down.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:01.940]   But I want to put it in this special way in which Peter put it, "You," he said, "are
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:07.500]   the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.380]   Abram, 'And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.'"
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.920]   Oh, he is the covenant God.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   What does that mean?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:21.580]   Well, he's a God who has a great plan and purpose.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:26.820]   He is, I say, the God who has determined and decided to do something about this world,
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.980]   to restore it to the condition in which he made it.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.260]   He's not going to let the devil to triumph and to conquer.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.220]   God has a plan, and he's told men that he's made an agreement, that's a covenant.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:42.700]   And he made it especially with Abram.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:48.140]   He visited Abram and he said, "In thee and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:53.300]   earth be blessed."
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:58.020]   And he repeated that promise of the covenant to Isaac, and then he repeated it to Jacob.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.540]   That's why Peter talks about the God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.780]   That is why God at the burning bush said to Moses, "I am the God of Abram and the God
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.900]   of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:14.460]   I am the covenant God.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:20.300]   I am the God who has determined before the foundation of the world to redeem mankind
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:26.580]   and restore this world to its original perfection, unto you first, God having raised up his son
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:31.100]   Jesus, sent him to bless you."
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:36.900]   God is determined to bless, and this is his covenant, this great plan of redemption.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.740]   God is determined to reconcile the world unto himself.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:46.660]   And he stated that first to Abram, then to Isaac, then to Jacob.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.060]   This is the eternal God.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.580]   Listen, says Peter, what's this?
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:59.460]   This is but a part of this great plan.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.340]   And then I leave you with this thought.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:20.180]   God of Abram, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, three generations but only one God.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:27.260]   He didn't merely reveal himself to Abram, he did again to Isaac and again to Jacob.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:32.020]   He didn't merely act in the case of Abram, but again in the case of Isaac, again in the
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.940]   case of Jacob.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.980]   And he didn't stop at Jacob.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:43.520]   He appeared to Moses in the burning bush, "I've come down," he said.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   He acted.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:49.020]   He took that people from the hopeless captivity and bondage of Egypt and he brought them out.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.020]   God acted.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.280]   He's the same God, still acting.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.020]   He reminds them, "I'm the same one.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.020]   I always was.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.020]   I always will be.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.740]   From eternity to eternity."
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   He's active.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:05.780]   In Sinai, he gave the law, he spoke, he revealed himself, he gave the plan, he spoke through
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:06.780]   the prophets.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:16.780]   Same God, God of Abram, Isaac, Jacob, everlasting, continuing, starts, continues, will finish.
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:28.360]   And then when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.180]   made under the law to redeem them that were under the law.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:36.260]   You look at the babe in the manger at Bethlehem and if you just stand there and look at the
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.580]   babe and try to understand, you're a fool, you're like Moses going to examine the burning
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.580]   bush.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.580]   What's the message?
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:50.860]   The message is this, God, the same God, the God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, is
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:57.260]   just continuing the carrying out of his plan and his purpose and here it is in its supreme
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.260]   form.
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.120]   In his Son, Jesus sends his Son into the world.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:07.380]   It's a part of the plan, the ancient plan, the promise to Abram, repeated to Isaac, repeated
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:12.780]   to Jacob, that in him and in his seed, this Son, he would bless all the nations of the
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.780]   world.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:21.940]   Oh yes, but that child, that Son was killed, well it's all right, says Peter, God raised
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.880]   him from the dead, same God.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:31.740]   And then he ascended into heaven as God finished acting, oh no, day of Pentecost, Holy Ghost
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:37.180]   sent down, same God, God of Abram, Isaac and of Jacob, he's still acting, he's still
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.380]   continuing and he's gone on throughout the running centuries.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.820]   What's a revival?
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:49.060]   God acting, God, Isaac, God of Abram, Isaac and of Jacob, the same eternal changeless
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:56.460]   God, unresting and hasting and silent as light, the God who is the Father of lights with whom
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.700]   is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.860]   What's your miserable science of the mid-20th century to do with this God?
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:10.980]   He's everlasting, he's eternal, he's absolute, the same changeless everlasting God, and he's
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:17.900]   the covenant God, and he'll go on with it until the times of revival shall come, the
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:26.140]   times of refreshing, yes, and until the restitution of all things shall have taken place, and
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.220]   God shall be all and in all.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.020]   That's the message.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.020]   What's this?
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:41.980]   Oh, this is but the specimen of the activity of that God.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.580]   Don't look at this, don't stop at this phenomenon, don't exercise your cleverness in trying to
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:50.740]   dissect miracles, don't look at us, what is this?
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:55.900]   It's God, this eternal God, God of Abram, Isaac and of Jacob, acting, he's still alive,
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:01.860]   he's still doing things, and he'll go on doing them until his plan is perfect and complete,
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:11.700]   and he has restored again to himself the universe as he intends it to be and as it will be.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:26.820]   God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, oh yes, this plan is certain and sure, nothing
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:36.260]   can stop it, nothing can deflect it from its course, let the heathen rage and the people
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:42.700]   imagine a vain thing, yet have I set my sun on my holy mount of Zion, the God who can
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:49.780]   defy and conquer death and the grave and the resurrection will bring his purpose to pass.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:54.820]   That's the message.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:55:01.780]   This is but a demonstration of that.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:09.000]   Did you know, my friend, that you are in the hands of this God, that he made you and not
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.620]   you yourself, that the world is his and not yours?
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:22.940]   Did you know that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of this living God?
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.700]   This is what he can do, what's lameness to him, he is the God who at the beginning said
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.540]   let there be light and there was light.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:36.460]   The everlasting, eternal, all-powerful God, the judge of the ends of the world, this is
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.460]   the message.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.740]   You are in his hands, you've got to answer him, you've got to give an account of your
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:45.780]   life to him, he's given you a soul, how have you used it, have you lived to his glory and
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:58.940]   to his praise, this is the message, the living God against whom we've all sinned and rebelled
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:05.540]   and who would be perfectly justified if he cast us into eternal and everlasting perdition.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:13.540]   But, blessed be his name, he is a covenant God.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:20.300]   He knows our misery, he's taken pity upon us, he's revealed himself to men, he's revealed
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:26.660]   his purpose and he has sent his only son into this world that whosoever believeth in him
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:37.260]   should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:42.100]   So you know the God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, what's your relationship to
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.100]   him?
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:50.860]   And here tonight this covenant-keeping God calls upon you to repent and to turn unto
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:57.420]   him, to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was his only begotten son who came into the world
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:03.140]   to die for you and your sins and to reconcile you to God according to God's plan and purpose
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:11.540]   and covenant and who will at this moment receive you unto himself if you but turn unto him.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:25.140]   Blessed be the name of the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, amen.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:29.060]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
