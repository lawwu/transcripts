[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Unfortunately, the first few moments of the following sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.040]   are missing. The Doctor is preaching from the first epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.080]   chapter 1 and verse 15. This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. We join the Doctor now
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.280]   during his opening introductory remarks.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:33.080]   The two perhaps are repeated now, and it is suggested that this was one of them. It is
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.680]   a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.840]   sinners. Very well, we are looking then not only at the definition of this great man,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.000]   this mastermind of what happened at Bethlehem, but at the same time we are looking at what
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.040]   the early Church repeated constantly to itself concerning this.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.120]   Now, the Apostle puts it, you remember, in terms of his own personal experience. What
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.360]   led him to say it was this, that he had had this great and inestimable privilege of being
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.600]   called to be a preacher of the gospel. And to him there was no greater honor than that.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.920]   There was nothing which was in any way comparable to it. He says, "According to the glorious
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.360]   gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust, and I thank Christ Jesus our
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.920]   Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.440]   who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious. But I obtained mercy because
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.280]   I did it ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.680]   and love which is in Christ Jesus." And then comes our text.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.900]   The Apostle glories in his calling. He can think of nothing higher than this, the privilege
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.360]   of preaching the gospel, of being a herald of the glad tidings, an announcer, a proclaimer
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   of the meaning of that which happened at Bethlehem there in that stable. Now, why does he glory
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.780]   in this? Well, here he tells us. And as he does so, he incidentally, it seems to me,
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.920]   tells us three main things, three great principles taught here, and I just want to hold them
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.080]   before you briefly. He first of all describes the character of this Christian message. That's
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.240]   why he gloried in being a preacher. That's why he exulted in the privilege of being a
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.800]   herald. It's the very character of the message. Well, what is the character of the message?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.840]   Well, this is what he says here. First, he says it's a faithful saying. This is not some
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.680]   idle gossip. This is not something which may be true or may not be true. We're all given
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400]   to that, aren't we? We hear something, and it's rather striking, and we go and repeat
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.520]   it. And somebody says, "Yes, but are you sure it's true?" It sounds very wonderful, but
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.440]   the question is, is it true? I've heard rumors before. Now, says the apostle, this isn't
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:29.580]   a rumor. This isn't idle gossip. This is a faithful saying. It's sure. It's true. Or
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.040]   perhaps the best word of all is, it's trustworthy. It's something which we are to receive, to
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.000]   accept, as he says. We needn't hesitate about this. It's not something which is doubtful.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.480]   It's not merely something which is speculative. It isn't some idea. Somebody's got some theory.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.200]   It isn't the incarnation of some hope. It isn't something taken out of the realm of
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.800]   fancy or fantasy. It isn't a detail in a novel. No, no. This is a faithful saying, says Paul.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.000]   This is history. This is fact. Well, how does he know that? On what grounds does he make
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.520]   this tremendous claim for his message, the thing which he was preaching? Well, if you
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.720]   go to him and read his letters, you'll find that he gives us abundant answers to that
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.760]   question. For instance, in writing to the Galatians, he's at great pains to make this
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.120]   clear beyond any doubt or peradventure whatsoever. They had been beginning to doubt all these
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.800]   things, to doubt his call, and to doubt whether the gospel was true. But listen, says Paul,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.200]   "Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.280]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." Well, why does he say this? Well, here's his
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.640]   answer. "I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.800]   men, for I neither received it of men, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.040]   Jesus Christ." What I'm preaching, says Paul, is not something that I've been told by another
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   man. I'm not passing on a message that I've received second-hand. I'm not an apostle as
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.280]   the others are. They were all together and they were with the Lord. I wasn't. I was a
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.620]   blasphemer, a persecutor, and an injurious person at that time. I wasn't one of the twelve
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.680]   apostles. I wasn't with them. Well, how is he a preacher? What right is he to say that
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.600]   this is a faithful saying? And his answer is this, that he received it directly from
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.560]   the Lord himself. He was traveling from Jerusalem to Damascus to exterminate the Christian church
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.080]   there, breathing out threatenings and slaughter, hating the very name of Christ. And suddenly,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.880]   about noonday, he saw that shining in the heavens above the brightest shining of the
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:05.140]   sun and the face, and he asked, "Who art thou, Lord?" And back came the answer, "I am Jesus
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.360]   whom thou persecutest." He got it all directly from him. Christ spoke to him on that road
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.680]   and said, "I'm going to make you a minister and a witness to the people and to the Gentiles."
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.240]   He gave him the commission. He called him to be an apostle. He gave him the message.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.960]   "I'm not repeating second-hand stories," says Paul. "I've got it from the fountainhead.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:36.040]   I've received it from the blessed Lord of glory himself. It's a faithful saying."
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.920]   But it wasn't merely Paul who said this. All the apostles said the same thing. You remember
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.680]   how Peter puts it very plainly and clearly? Some of us were here considering this very
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.280]   thing last Christmas morning. "We have not preached unto you," says Peter, "cunningly
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.520]   devised fables, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty when we were with him on the holy
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.600]   mount." Ah, my friends, it's still true. Our whole position is based upon this apostolic
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:16.840]   testimony. The gospel is fact. It's a faithful saying. It is something on which we can rely.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.000]   It is trustworthy. We have this tremendous authentication for it. The church is built
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.060]   upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. The men who were with him heard his words,
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.240]   saw his miracles, saw him dying on the cross, saw him buried in the grave, saw the stone
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.280]   rolled onto it, and then, when together in the inner room, saw him suddenly appearing
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   though the doors were shut and there was no means of entry, saw him ascending into heaven.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:55.200]   That's the authentication. It's a faithful saying. It is sure, it is true, it is trustworthy.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.120]   But he's got a second reason for glorying in the preaching of this message, and that
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:08.280]   is, he says, it's a gospel according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God. The
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.200]   apostle didn't go around the world preaching a second law. He was preaching good news,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.040]   a gospel. He came to people in sin and misery and shame and had a great and a wondrous message.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.640]   "Listen," he says, "listen to what I have to tell you. Good news, gospel."
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.520]   It's not, I say, a new law. He didn't go around making fresh demands upon people. He
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.760]   didn't just go around preaching a certain bit of moralism and ethical teaching. He didn't
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.040]   go and tell people, "Just listen. If you put a great effort into it and pull yourselves
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   together, at last you can save yourselves and lift up your world." That's not good
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.360]   news. We are tired out and weak and exhausted. We are already failures. No, no. He says,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:01.400]   "I haven't come to give good advice even." He has come to be the herald of a gospel,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:09.120]   of good news. And he's full of rejoicing and of praise and of exultation because of
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.000]   the character of his message. But he tells us a third thing about it, for
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.520]   me to note these things hurriedly. I wish I could stay with them for hours. It's not
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:27.120]   only a gospel, he says, it is the gospel of the glory of the blessed God. For that is
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.200]   the right translation of verse 11. This Authorized Version has it like this, "According to the
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.320]   glorious gospel of the blessed God." But that isn't right, it isn't good. This is
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:46.380]   the translation, "According to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God." And this
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:54.400]   was his supreme reason for glorying in his preaching of the gospel. "There is nothing
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:01.720]   which so displays the glory of God as this gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.040]   Ah, we know that God's glory is to be seen in many ways. The psalmist tells us in the
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:15.160]   nineteenth psalm, "The heavens declare the glory of God." And they do. Look up in
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.400]   a starry night, look at the sun and the moon and the stars at any time. Look at the mountains
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.540]   and the valleys, the rivers and the streams, the beauty of the flowers and the little lambs
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:34.480]   gambling in the field, the heavens and all creation. "Declare the glory of God, and
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.160]   the firmament manifests and displays the wonders of his way."
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:52.320]   Ah, but it all pales into insignificance when we put it side by side with this. It is here
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:11:03.280]   you see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the gospel of the glory of the blessed
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:10.360]   God. Do you remember how, when God gave the law to Moses, great glory was manifested?
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.560]   The people couldn't touch the mount, they couldn't draw near unto it even if any animal
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.840]   touched it, he died. And there was the cloud and the fire and the smoke and the glory of
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:29.120]   God over it all. Moses had a glimpse of it, and the effect of that upon him was to make
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.600]   his face shine, reflecting the glory of God. There was great glory manifested in the giving
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:44.640]   of the law. But it is nothing when you put it side by side with the glory that shines
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   from the face of that babe in Bethlehem. God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.640]   hath shined into our hearts. What for? To reveal the light of the knowledge of the glory
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:10.880]   of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Oh, he is the express image of his person and the
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   effulgence of the whole glory of God. Well, there are the apostles' reasons for glorying
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:25.400]   in his office, for glorying in being allowed to preach this gospel. It's a faithful saying.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:35.240]   It's good news. It is the supreme manifestation of the glory of God. He tells us that. But
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.000]   then he tells us a second thing about all this, and that is that this, he says, is a
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.480]   message which should lead to a response. In other words, he is not just a philosopher
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.080]   going and propounding a new theory to an academic group of people who sit in a detached manner
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.440]   and look on and listen and enjoy it. No, no. This is a message which does something. It
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:04.080]   calls for a response. It is a faithful saying and worthy of all
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:11.000]   acceptation. Now, this is a striking phrase, and we must be perfectly clear in our minds
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.440]   as to what it means. What does he mean by worthy of all acceptation? Well, negatively,
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:27.600]   he does not mean that it is just worthy of our approbation, although not merely worthy
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:35.080]   of our intellectual interest and acceptance and agreement. It does demand that, but it
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:43.440]   doesn't stop there. All acceptation is much more than approbation or assent or approval.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.200]   We are not meant just to applaud this and to look on as looking under the spectacle
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.600]   and saying, "How marvelous, how wonderful," and then continue as we were before. No, no.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:06.240]   All acceptation. What does he mean? Well, the term means this, to take fully, to welcome,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.920]   to receive gladly, and therefore to respond to it, and therefore to yield to it. That's
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   what he means by full acceptation. Now, these are not my theories. You turn up your authorities
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.680]   and you'll find that that is what the word means. Full, all acceptation. To take fully
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.840]   unto yourself, to be mastered, to be gripped by it, to be controlled by it, to yield yourself
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.400]   to it. Or, if I may put it in a phrase, the faithfulness of the message, it is a faithful
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:45.600]   saying. Yes, the faithfulness of the message should lead to faith in it. Not a detached
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:55.520]   consideration, not an idle contemplation, oh no, but a response, a full, all acceptation.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:03.560]   In other words, the apostle was proud of preaching this gospel because it is something that takes
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:10.760]   up the whole man and governs and controls the whole life. Something that is so full
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:19.360]   of dynamic that it revolutionizes men and makes them anew and changes nations. Oh, listen
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.680]   to him putting it in that immortal phrase to the Romans, "I am not ashamed of the gospel
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:33.120]   of Christ." Why not? Well, he says, because it is the power of God, the dynamic of God,
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.560]   and to salvation to everyone that believe it. It will turn the world upside down. It
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.920]   will turn sinners into saints. It will take a hopeless drunkard and turn him into someone
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.440]   who adorns the life of the church. It can come to a harlot and a prostitute and make
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:56.160]   of her a madonna. The power of God, and to salvation to everyone that believe it. It
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:04.000]   is worthy of all acceptation. It is so wonderful and glorious that it is to be fully received
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.520]   by the whole personality and the entire man is changed as a result of it. It is not surprising
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.380]   that he was proud of this message and proud of ever being called to preach it and to proclaim
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:28.560]   it. But that brings me to my third and my last principle and the most practical of all.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.440]   If that is the character of the gospel and if that is the result and the end to which
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:43.640]   it is meant to lead, the question that then arises is this, isn't it? What is it that
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   determines whether that is our response to it or not? And the apostle tells us here,
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:17:03.560]   he shows clearly what determines whether that full or all acceptation is our response to
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:11.620]   this message or not. Well, what is it that determines it? Need I apologize for asking
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:18.640]   you a personal question on this Christmas morning? Have you accepted this message? Have
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:25.520]   you given it all acceptation? Does it dominate your life? Is this the chief thing in your
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:32.400]   life? That's what's meant by all acceptation, that you've seen it's a faithful, a true saying.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:40.880]   You've seen what it is and you've given your whole being in a glad response. Is that so?
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.440]   Is that true of us? What is it that makes a man respond to it in that way and give it
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.520]   all acceptation? Well, let me just note the things the apostle tells us here. The first
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   thing is our view of what happened there at Bethlehem so long ago. What did happen there?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.320]   We are thinking of a babe in a manger this morning. Ah yes, but our response to that
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:17.680]   event is determined by this, our view of the babe. Who is this babe? Who is this person?
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.840]   Is he just an ordinary babe like every other babe? Is he born out of ordinary wedlock?
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:29.080]   Has he a human father and mother? Is he just of natural generation? Who is this babe? That's
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:36.480]   the thing that's going to determine my response and my acceptance. And the apostle makes it
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:46.080]   perfectly plain, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:54.600]   Jesus came into the world. Yes, we are looking at a babe and his name is Jesus. But who is
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:03.000]   this Jesus? And you notice the apostle gives us the answer in one word, and it's the word
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.440]   of God. He doesn't say Christ Jesus was born, he says Christ Jesus came into the world.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:19.320]   This is no ordinary babe. This is not one in a series of births the result of natural
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:26.840]   generation. Here is one of whom we say that he wasn't born, but that he came into the
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:35.480]   world. Where did he come from? He came from eternity. He came from heaven. He came from
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:43.200]   the bosom of the everlasting Father, and no one else has ever come from there. He said
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.280]   himself in speaking to Nicodemus later on in his life, he says no man hath ascended
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:56.640]   into heaven except the Son of Man which has come from heaven, who is in heaven. Here is
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:03.800]   the mystery and the marvel of it all. He came into the world. Jesus, who is he? Well, he's
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.920]   the Christ, he's the Messiah, he's the Anointed One, he's the one of whom the prophets have
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   been singing, the one typified in the law and in the offerings and the sacrifices, the
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:21.120]   Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world. He, here is the one who has come,
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:33.240]   Jesus certainly, but Christ, the long-promised Messiah. Who is he? Well, John answers the
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.440]   question by telling us in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:50.560]   Word was God, the everlasting Son of God, the Lord of glory, the second person in the
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:57.160]   blessed Holy Trinity. He is the one who has come, he has left heaven, he has divested himself
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.680]   of the insignia of his eternal glory, and he has humbled himself, and he has come in
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:10.620]   the fashion of a man, in the likeness of sinful flesh, born as a helpless babe. Jesus, yes,
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:18.840]   but the Christ, the everlasting and eternal Son of God. This is the first thing that determines
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   our acceptance, this is the thing that conditions our response. But let's look at it like this,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:38.520]   this person, this second person, in the blessed Holy Trinity, came and came into the world.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:47.720]   If this doesn't break our hearts, nothing will. He came from that everlasting and eternal
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:22:00.240]   glory, from the highest throne of heaven, into the world. And you and I know what the
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   world is. It's London at midnight, it's the London and the world of the newspapers, with
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.160]   the crime and the vice and the malice and the envy and the bitterness and the hatred.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:26.480]   The world, he came from those realms of glory, into the world. He humbled himself, he abased
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.520]   himself, he descended. Was there ever such condescension? Was there ever such abasement?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.960]   Well, that's it, says the apostle. You see, the first thing that determines our response
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.080]   is our view of that little babe. And do we realize, dear friends, this morning, as we
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.800]   ought, that that babe is the Lord of glory, the creator of everything? Without whom nothing
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.400]   that is created, that was created, was created. All things were made by him and without him
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.840]   was not anything made that is made. The one who fashioned the universe is lying helpless
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:13.600]   in that manger. It's as we realize that we respond to it. But he came so low, into poverty
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.880]   and into this world of sin and wretchedness and shame.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:23.560]   But come, let me hurry on to the second thing. Our view, I say, of what happened at Bethlehem
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.280]   is the first thing that determines our response, but this is the second. Our view of why he
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:38.760]   ever did this, our view of why he came, our view of why he has done what he did and what
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:45.000]   he has done. What is it? Well, here it is, once and forever. This is a faithful saying
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:00.840]   and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world. Why? To save sinners.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.920]   And if we are not clear about this, we can't rejoice in this message and we'll not give
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.520]   it all acceptation. Let me put my negatives again, therefore, and they were never needed
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:16.640]   more than today. Jesus Christ came into this world not simply to teach us. He didn't come
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.280]   simply to give us a formula for solving the international problems or the racial problem
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.760]   in South Africa. There are men who give the impression that that's the whole of Christianity,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:32.240]   pacifism and interracial questions. They are the mere corollaries. He didn't come to do
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:40.520]   that. He didn't come to teach. He didn't come to teach only. Neither did he come only to
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.960]   give us an example of how to live. Neither did he come just to help us to live. Thank
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.840]   God he does all these things, but he didn't come to do them. That isn't the object. What
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:25:00.560]   is it then? He came into the world to save sinners. To save them. What does this mean?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:08.880]   Well, it means a deliberate purpose. He came as a part of God's great plan and purpose
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.520]   of salvation and of redemption. You needn't take my word for this. Listen to him. He said,
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:27.520]   "The Son of Man is come," why? "To seek and to save that which is lost." Same thing. Or
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:35.160]   listen to him again. "The Son of Man," he says, "is not come to be ministered unto,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:47.760]   but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many." To save. Listen to him offering
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.160]   his high priestly prayer just before he goes to the cross. "Father," he says, "I have
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.960]   finished the work which thou gavest me to do." Why has he come? Well, he's been given
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:06.040]   a task. God the Father gave him something to do. He gave him a task. He gave him a particular
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.200]   bit of work to carry out. And he says, "Father, I have finished the work which thou gavest
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:18.000]   me to do." And there he is dying on the cross and you hear him saying, "It is finished!"
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.960]   There, he has finished the task. Well, what is this task? Well, it's all here in these
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:36.520]   words, to save, to deliver, to set free. I wonder on this Christmas morning whether we
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.800]   are all perfectly clear about this, that the gospel of Jesus Christ in the first instance
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   doesn't ask us to do anything, but it tells us what Christ has done for us. Have you got
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.880]   that clearly? If you haven't, you won't accept this message and you won't go away rejoicing
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.440]   and singing as the shepherds went of old. People think of the gospel as a task, a bit
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   of good advice, a new law, a teaching. No, no, before it asks you to do anything it comes
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:11.480]   as good news. And what's the good news? Well, it tells us what he has done for us men and
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:19.400]   for our salvation. What has he done? Well, listen to the apostle putting it elsewhere.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:30.360]   "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. He hath made him to be sin for
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.520]   us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." Why did
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:42.680]   he come? He came to make this redemption possible. He came, says the author of the epistle to
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:53.920]   the Hebrews, to taste death for every man. He came to make his soul an offering for sin,
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:02.000]   who his own self bore our trespasses in his own body on the tree, that we being dead unto
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.080]   sins should live unto righteousness. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:19.040]   to remove our sins, to reconcile us to God, to bring us to God. That's why he came, no
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:27.180]   less. He came, if you like, to die. He came to bear the guilt and punishment of our transgressions.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:34.480]   By his stripes we are healed. He came to save. That's the primary object, and it's only men
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.120]   who realize that, who rejoice in him, and who accept this message fully. So that brings
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:45.720]   me to my last word, and with this I stop. He came to save. That's the primary object,
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.620]   and it's only men who realize that, who rejoice in him, and who accept this message fully.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:58.280]   So that brings me to my last word, and with this I stop. What determines whether we accept
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:04.520]   this message or not is first, I say, our view of him, secondly, our view of what he came
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:16.140]   to do, and thirdly, our view of ourselves. It is a faithful saying and worthy of all
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:27.840]   acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I, I am the
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:37.320]   chief. And it's this last thing, our view of ourselves, that determines whether we accept
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:45.240]   the message fully or not. The Pharisee that our Lord depicted in Luke 18, the Pharisee
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.960]   and the publican going up into the temple to pray, he didn't need a Savior. "I thank
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   God," he says, "that I'm not as other men are, especially this publican. I fast twice
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.840]   in the week. I give a tenth of my goods to feed the poor." He doesn't need a Savior.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.080]   He saved himself. He's perfect. He does everything. He's marvelous. He's wonderful. He's contented.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.760]   He doesn't rejoice over the babe of Bethlehem. Why? He's never seen any need of him. Christ
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.360]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, and he said, "They that are whole have no
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.200]   need of a physician, but they that are sick." "I came," he says, "not to call the righteous,
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.520]   but sinners to repentance." The Pharisees didn't rejoice in him. Why? Well, because
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.120]   he made them feel that they were sinners, and they didn't like that. They never saw
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.360]   the need of salvation. The publicans and the harlots, he says, go crowding into the kingdom,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.680]   and you remain outside. They knew that they were sinners.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:49.080]   The only people who give all acceptation to this message are the people who have seen
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:56.840]   themselves condemned, damned sinners under the holy law of God. "They are men who have
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.600]   seen that the law demands this, that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.720]   and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength, and thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.960]   And who realize that they haven't done it? They haven't loved God with all of their being.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.040]   They haven't loved their neighbors. They're selfish, self-centered. They've spurned the
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.200]   vice divine. They've ignored God. They've put their will before God's. They've put their
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:29.560]   children before God, husband or wife, money or car or position or country. And they're
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:35.120]   sinners in the sight of God, and they're hopeless, and the law of God condemns them, and they
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.960]   say, "What can I do?" They're the people who rejoice to hear that Christ Jesus has come
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:49.800]   into the world to save sinners. And if a man doesn't realize that he is a sinner, he'll
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.240]   see nothing in Christmas, oh, except a means for jollification. He won't be thrilled. He
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.720]   won't sing. He won't join the angelic choir. Why? Well, he doesn't feel he has need of
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.400]   anything and nothing's happened. But if a man has seen himself going to hell and hopeless
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:13.040]   and the law of God thundering against him, and then realizes that the Son of God came
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:19.200]   to take over all his debt and sin and shame and guilt and bore it himself and has paid
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:25.120]   the bill and crossed out the books and has reconciled him to God, why, he realizes he
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.960]   owes everything to him. And he drops on his knees before him, and he worships him and
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:40.160]   he praises him. That's the thing, isn't it? "I," says Paul, "who was a blasphemer and
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:47.680]   injurious, he had mercy upon me." He puts it again to the Galatians. He says, "The Son
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:58.040]   of God who loved me and gave himself for me." Oh, I know that Christmas is a time of general
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:07.680]   goodwill and affability, but you know, ultimately it's a very personal occasion, isn't it?
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.760]   What gift have I received? What have you given me? Oh, we give gifts to one another, I know,
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.880]   but if it was simply something external, it wouldn't mean much to us. It's the personal
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:23.400]   element. It's the time for a personal expression of interest and goodwill and of love. You
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.960]   give a person a present, you send a Christmas card, you're expressing an interest in them
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.760]   individually, and that's what we like about all this. It's perfectly right, isn't it?
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:43.120]   Ah, yes, but it's infinitely more true here. Christmas isn't a general idea. It's the
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:50.120]   thing that brings me back to this and reminds me of the fact that the Lord of glory, the
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:59.440]   eternal Son of God, so loved me. Me, the vile creature that I know myself to be, in whom
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:08.880]   there is no good thing, damned and lost if I'm left to myself. He loved me, and he gave
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:18.200]   himself on that cross for me. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:27.640]   acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I, I am the
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   chief. Very well, I'll be the foremost in the choir. I'll sing louder than anyone else.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.800]   I'll be ever in the forefront of the army that praises him and glorifies and magnifies
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:50.200]   his holy name. What of you, my friend? Does all this come to you personally this morning?
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:57.480]   Do you know that the Son of God loved you and has given himself for you? Have you given
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:04.560]   this message all acceptation? Have you received it into your heart? Have you given yourself
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:16.920]   to it? Oh, let me put it like this. Is there deep within your being this morning a sense
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:25.520]   of gratitude and of praise, thankfulness unto God? Do you want to say with Paul, "Thanks
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:37.000]   be unto God for his unspeakable gift"? Is there joy and peace in your heart because
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.080]   the Son of God came down to Bethlehem and then went to the cross and the grave and rose
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:57.920]   again so that you might be made a child of God and an heir of the bliss and the glory
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:07.040]   of God and of heaven? It's a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. If you have
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:16.240]   never accepted it before, do it this Christmas morning. Receive the gift of life and become
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:24.840]   a child of God and an heir of his glory. Amen.
