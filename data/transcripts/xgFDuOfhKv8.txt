[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:19.460]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue,
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.740]   the show where we take questions from you, the viewers,
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.660]   at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.660]   Duncan, question number one, how do I look for the tan?
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.740]   - You look really good.
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.580]   - Thank you. - It's a good tan.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.560]   - Yeah. - All right.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.500]   I was in the sun for a few days in Florida.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.880]   - Which was more relaxing, the Miami Vices or the sun?
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.180]   - Miami Vices in the sun, I think, was a nice,
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.180]   that's like a balanced portfolio right there.
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.860]   Yeah, I didn't think about the markets very much at all.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.260]   But if you go through,
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.620]   I've been catching up on our inbox here.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100]   It's interesting because during a bear market,
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.740]   there's two types of questions.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.860]   One is, what's my strategy for catching the bottom
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.420]   or what do I do during this bear market?
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.620]   How do I take advantage?
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.460]   And two is basically,
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.140]   I need to blow up my whole financial plan
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.260]   or I don't have one.
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.100]   And I think that's the dichotomy right now is,
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.620]   oh no, I thought I knew what I was doing
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.420]   because I was in a bull market and now I don't
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.700]   and now what do I do?
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.880]   So there's a lot of that
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.860]   and then there's a lot of what do I do?
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340]   So that's the theme today, right?
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.600]   Blow up my financial plan
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.100]   or how do I handle this bear market?
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.540]   So let's do it.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.500]   - Okay, actually, before we do that, though,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.580]   John, let's share that photo,
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.220]   that great photo of Ben enjoying,
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.660]   what is, is this a margarita?
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.140]   This isn't a Miami Vice, right?
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.340]   - No, that's a margarita.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.500]   I saw a giant margarita cup
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.380]   and I told my wife, I'm like,
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620]   well, I have to order one because look at it.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.940]   It's, you know, it's a giant margarita cup, so.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.760]   - I'm jealous.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.660]   I think we should kick off next week
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.420]   with margaritas and Miami Vices.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.060]   - All right, I think that's what people in the chat
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.980]   were saying, basically, if everyone's ready.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.540]   We're at the drinking stage of the bear markets.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.940]   All right, let's do the first question.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.760]   - Okay.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.620]   So up first, we have--
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.380]   - By the way, there was no bottom in that margarita either.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.740]   It was bottomless, just like the stock market.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.500]   - That's, yeah, I would probably be dead.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.860]   I'd be dead.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.460]   Okay, so up first.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.540]   I think the correct answer is that anyone
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.560]   with a 15 to 30 year time horizon should DCA and chill,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.700]   but is there a case for going to cash
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.380]   and then lump summing into a bottom
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.220]   that you would be comfortable with?
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.940]   My current philosophy is to put 10% into my 401k
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.780]   with an additional 3.5% company match,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.760]   $500 a month into a Roth, $50 a day into a trading account,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.340]   and to not touch money I have in a TSP.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.940]   I don't know what a TSP is.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.860]   I wish I had started this earlier,
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.900]   but better late than never, I guess.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.580]   It just seems like every time I'm close
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.380]   to getting everything sorted financially,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.940]   the market gods look down and say,
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.660]   "Not today, not on my watch."
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.540]   - All right, we gotta add this one to your list of acronyms.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.140]   TSP is Thrift Savings Plan.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.980]   That's the government's retirement plan,
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860]   which is honestly one of the best retirement plans
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.900]   that there is, my brother works for the government,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.900]   and all of the funds are index funds,
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.160]   and they all cost like two to five basis points
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.740]   'cause it's all the federal government.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.740]   - I remember you discussing this
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.100]   on Animal Spirits a long time ago.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.000]   - Yeah, it's a very good one.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.940]   So all right, Bernard Baruch was this
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.700]   really well-known investor who made a ton of money,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.460]   who ended up being one of the wealthiest men
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.980]   in the world in the early 1900s.
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.460]   He actually made it, of all things,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.020]   speculating in the sugar markets
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.620]   when he got a seat at the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.100]   And even though he called a few tops in his day,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.900]   I think he actually called the 1929 top pretty good,
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.380]   he said, his famous quote is,
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.440]   "Don't try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.380]   "It can't be done except by liars."
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.760]   And here's the problem with market timing.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.520]   It's a gateway drug to either a cash addiction
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.060]   or future market timing, right?
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.300]   Because you have to be right twice,
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.620]   once on the way out and then once you need to get back in.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.580]   I actually received an email from a reader a few years ago
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.620]   who said that he got out at the top at the end of 1999,
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.580]   like probably one of the biggest peaks
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.220]   in stock market history, right?
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.420]   Dot-com bubble was just about to crash.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.440]   He told me in 2015, he was still sitting in cash since 1999.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.460]   Now, this guy nailed the top
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.100]   and then sat in cash for almost two decades.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.080]   So I wrote him back and I said, why did you do this?
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.780]   Like, what do you think the reasoning is?
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.160]   I'm trying to get behind the psychology of this.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.900]   He wrote me back and he said, there's three things.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.820]   One was fear.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.700]   He was just scared
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.420]   that he was gonna put all his money back in
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.260]   and then the market was gonna fall further
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.620]   because something else was gonna happen.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.300]   Two, he said it was arrogance.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.740]   He thought that he could do this kind of thing
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.740]   without incurring the emotional costs of timing the market.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.300]   And three, he said he had this loss of confidence
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.580]   in most asset classes because of government spending
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.100]   or whatever, one of these macro fears.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.460]   And his quote was, I'm living proof
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.060]   that the challenge in timing the market is being right,
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.380]   both in getting out and getting back in,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.960]   plus having the courage and confidence to take action.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.060]   'Cause I think anytime you do this,
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.180]   one of the worst things that can happen
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.940]   is you actually get it right.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.740]   You either put money in at the bottom
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.580]   or you take it out at the top
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.220]   and you think, well, I should just do this again.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.620]   This was easy, right?
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.300]   Then you kind of think, well, wait, maybe I should,
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.380]   once I got out, I should wait a little longer.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.340]   Stocks keep dropping.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.380]   Maybe I should wait a little longer.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.100]   There was a study done by Peter Lynch back in the '90s.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.100]   He looked at this three-year window from 1965 to 1995.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.740]   And he found that if you were able to nail the bottom
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.220]   every single year in the lowest of the stock market,
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.900]   the lowest point of the year every single year
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.260]   over this 30-year window,
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.160]   you would have had returns of like 11.7% per year.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.380]   But if you just put your money to work
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.200]   on the first day of the year and not tried to guess anything,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.700]   you would have had returns of 11% per year.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.780]   So you got less than 1%
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.420]   for nailing the bottom every single year.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.660]   And by the way,
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.940]   nailing the bottom every single year is basically impossible.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.260]   So, I mean, just like the simple strategy is just,
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.580]   I'd say don't overthink it.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.800]   No one can pick tops or bottoms.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.420]   It's almost impossible to do.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.160]   And this person already has a good strategy
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.560]   of putting money in their foreign K,
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.760]   putting money in their Roth,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.340]   putting money into their trading account.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.340]   Have yourself a little speculation account.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.860]   Maybe you can try to do it there,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.540]   but trying to do it for your whole portfolio
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.420]   and lump summing in and trying to nail the bottom.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.460]   I just don't see the point of putting yourself
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.660]   through like the emotional ringer in rollercoaster
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.720]   that you go through of trying to do that
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.740]   and all the stress involved if you're right
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.580]   or if you're wrong.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.480]   It's just, it's not worth it to me.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I feel like personally,
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.580]   I'm pretty good at picking the tops and buying the tops,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.700]   but yeah, the bottoms are much harder, it seems like.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.540]   - The anti-dunking strategy.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.260]   - You guys have talked a lot about before
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.780]   how the biggest up days are in the middle
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.020]   of some of the worst, craziest times in the market, right?
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.580]   So, it's one of those things like, yeah,
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.940]   it doesn't even behoove you that much
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.160]   to really mess with it and try to pick the perfect entry.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.780]   - And right when you put that lump sum to work,
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.420]   you're just gonna be a wreck because you're gonna think
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.620]   that you're gonna regret your decision for doing it.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.220]   I just don't see what the point is
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.620]   of putting yourself through that
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.580]   because at the end of the day,
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.880]   is it really going to change your finances that much?
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.780]   So, Jason Zweig did this thing
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.240]   where he interviewed these people a number of years ago,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.900]   all these people in Boca Raton, Florida,
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.460]   which is a nice retirement community,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.500]   and the quote was something like,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.260]   he's sitting in all these elegant homes
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.420]   and manicured lawns and palm trees,
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.540]   and he asked the people, "To get here,
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.580]   "did you have to beat the market?"
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.060]   And some people said, "Yeah, I beat the market.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.900]   "I produced some alpha."
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.720]   Some people said, "I don't know."
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.700]   And then one guy said, "Who cares?
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.620]   "All I know is my investments helped me end up in Boca,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.460]   "so what does it matter?"
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.140]   So, I think in 30 or 40 years,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.100]   is it really gonna matter if you nail the bottom?
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.620]   Like, is it gonna change your financial picture that much
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.460]   if you actually do?
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.380]   So, if not, what's the point?
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.980]   - Right. - That's the whole thing.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.980]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.500]   - Okay.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.900]   So, I'm 38 years old and have accumulated
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.460]   a portfolio of index funds through years of investing.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.540]   I was wondering if it makes sense
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.980]   to hedge for downside protection
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.600]   so that a market crash doesn't wipe out
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.100]   years of investing returns.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.700]   Also, what is probably the best method of doing this?
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.780]   Long puts, short futures.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.380]   I know a perfect hedge doesn't exist
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.260]   and understand that hedging costs money
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.220]   and is not guaranteed to work as planned.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.580]   This is one our regulars will notice from.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.420]   What are your thoughts?
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.900]   But we didn't really get to dive that deep into it,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.420]   so we wanted to kind of go deeper.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.500]   - John, every time I hear someone talk about hedging,
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.340]   I have to think of this.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.980]   John, put up the commercial here from,
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.180]   this is a CNBC commercial from Interactive Brokers,
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.740]   I believe, a few years ago.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.980]   This turned into a meme pretty quick on Fintwit.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.420]   She was having dinner and the market was down 2%
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.420]   and she said, "Excuse me, I need to play
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.960]   "some hedging trades."
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.000]   - (sighs) I don't, so after 2008,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.880]   tail risk strategies were all rage.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.320]   And the problem is these strategies only came into vogue
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.840]   after the crash had occurred.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   And the idea is, right, you buy these options
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.200]   and then when volatility spikes,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.920]   these option prices go up.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.440]   And I guess the thing about it, thinking it is,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.920]   well, you're paying insurance premiums
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.240]   'cause those are, maybe when the bull market,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.280]   you know, from 2009, 2021 or whatever,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.760]   those tail risk strategies are gonna be a huge drag on you.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.080]   So you think, well, it's an insurance premium
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.800]   for when the world does blow up, then it's gonna happen.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.080]   I will say option strategies are difficult to implement
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.600]   because, so this is not something you'd wanna try
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.520]   on your own because unless you really, truly understand
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.380]   how those contracts work, how they're priced, et cetera,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.260]   I just don't think that that's something
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.060]   that you wanna be dabbling in.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.960]   And the problem with using options
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.040]   to hedge your portfolio at all times
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.080]   is that the market goes up most of the time.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.980]   So John, throw this chart up from Ed Yardeni.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.220]   This is just the bull market since 1928.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.520]   He kind of defines this as it's reset
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.240]   after a bear market of 20%.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.840]   And you can see there's a lot of them.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.720]   Now, I look back at this going back to just 1950.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.800]   So the average bear market since 1950 is a loss of 36%.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.280]   So that's what we're talking about, right?
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.400]   If you're up a dollar, you're back down to,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.820]   call it 65 cents after the average bear market.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.960]   I guess there's different strategies to hedge
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.940]   if you're gonna be on something like a tail risk strategy
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.760]   that's done for you.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.600]   I mean, the easiest one
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.560]   is probably just hold more cash or bonds, right?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.480]   Some people would say, "Well, bonds are a terrible hedge
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.800]   "because they prove this year they don't work."
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.640]   I don't know.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.100]   I don't think one year can disprove
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.720]   the way fixed income securities work
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.640]   just 'cause rates are rising from historically low levels.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.120]   But cash is a pretty easy one, right?
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.800]   That nominally, you're not gonna lose money.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.840]   On the real basis, you are, but not nominally.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.160]   Then you could look at things like commodities
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.120]   or managed futures, which can go long and short the markets,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.300]   maybe a trend following strategy.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.160]   I think a lot of the easiest hedges
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.920]   are actually more personal finance related.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.560]   So, just having a more patient
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.660]   long-term investment strategy,
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.840]   setting the right asset allocation ahead of time,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   extending your time rise in a little bit,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   maybe saving more money,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.180]   and then just the ability to stick
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.760]   with your investment plan during a downturn.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.640]   So, I think the problem with hedges is
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.300]   they always seem more attractive
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.680]   after a bear market has happened.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.280]   And then they seem less attractive during a bull market.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   And I think that's the problem,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.560]   is people jump into them after stocks are down
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.580]   and then they wanna get out of them after stocks are up.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.420]   Could you find a strategy
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.060]   that you're willing to put 5% of your portfolio in?
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.620]   Some sort of tail risk strategy
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.420]   that's gonna maybe help you
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.220]   when everything else is going bad?
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.460]   Sure, but I don't know,
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.760]   isn't just holding a little more cash
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.900]   and have a little more equity probably a better option
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.340]   because you know exactly how that strategy
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.100]   is gonna perform regardless
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.260]   and it's not gonna surprise you at all?
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.460]   - Yeah, it kind of brings to mind
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.980]   the phrase adding insult to injury.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.220]   If you're just like, yeah,
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.220]   once the market's already down big, you're hedging,
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.480]   then the market starts to go back up at some point
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.280]   and you've got all these hedges on
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.080]   that are then moving against you.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.840]   So it's kind of like you're messing yourself
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.200]   up both directions.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.680]   - Yeah, again, if you wanna have an insurance strategy
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.800]   and you understand that you're paying premiums on it,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.320]   for most of the time you're paying insurance on your house
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.800]   and it doesn't burn down, but that's still good money,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.640]   that makes sense.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.120]   But it's just something you really have to stick with
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.480]   and not jump in and out of.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.800]   - Yep.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.220]   - All right, let's do one more.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.540]   - Okay, up next is a long one, so stick with us.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.080]   I'm trying to figure out how to be opportunistic
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.280]   in a bear market.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.000]   I don't have cash on the sidelines
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   and with five kids, I don't have much disposable income
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.300]   to put to work, so I'm resorting to the following moves.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.520]   One, upping my 401(k) contribution to 19%
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.460]   from the usual 9%.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.800]   I'm buying cheaper and it's these kinds of markets
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.320]   where the long-term money is likely made.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.160]   This will also help make up for any mistakes
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.220]   I make in number two below,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.920]   but I can't afford this percent for long.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.180]   Number two, DCA-ing into beaten up growth stocks in my IRA.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.220]   I think there are some stocks that are down 40 to 70%
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.540]   but are great deals.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.720]   It's okay if the stocks continue to go down,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.420]   I'm just nibbling and will continue to nibble
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.060]   as prices drop.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.840]   Am I onto something or am I just excusing bad behavior?
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.660]   Overall portfolio, counting IRAs and 401(k)
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.800]   is in the $550,000 range and I'm 53 years old.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.120]   - You know what I noticed?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.340]   People only nibble during a bear market.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.340]   There's no nibbling that's done in a bull market, right?
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.020]   In a bear market, everyone nibbling
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.840]   because they're so concerned that once you buy a stock,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.680]   it's going to go down again,
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.420]   which seems to be happening a lot in this market.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.260]   Listen, number one, I love the strategy
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.360]   of increasing your savings rate if possible right now.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.100]   Again, some people say, "Well, that's market timing."
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.940]   So what?
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.020]   You're buying more when the market is down,
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.220]   even if you don't completely nail the bottom.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.060]   I like the idea.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.220]   And if you say, "I can't afford it for long,
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.220]   "just do it for a little while,"
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.180]   you're not going to regret those purchases.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.420]   I think it sounds like your strategy to me
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.980]   is something like a core and explore.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.020]   And the core is your 401(k).
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.800]   That sounds to me like it's more long-term.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.820]   You're just buying stocks, hopefully a low-cost index fund,
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.460]   target date fund kind of thing.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.820]   And then in your other account, your IRA,
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.620]   you're speculating a little bit.
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.780]   I don't have a problem with that
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.220]   as long as it's sized correctly.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.640]   I think if you want to scratch that itch and do it,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.840]   that's fine, so it's like this core explore.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.820]   I don't think that's big of a deal.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.020]   As long as you understand that IRA is speculation,
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.380]   it could go really wrong.
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.860]   Some of these stocks may never come back,
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.580]   but buying down 40 to 70% probably is better
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.860]   than buying when they're up three or 400%.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.480]   I guess the one thing you have to think about
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.980]   if you're doing this strategy,
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.140]   like what's your out if things continue to go wrong?
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.300]   When would you consider changing course?
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.700]   What's your holding period for these stocks?
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.660]   How long are you willing to be wrong, quote unquote,
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.920]   if they continue to go against you?
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.980]   That's the thing I think a lot of people
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.820]   don't really think about.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.220]   They just think, "Well, I bought a stock down 70%,
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.420]   "so even if it gets back to break even,
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.100]   "I'm gonna do wonderfully and triple my money or whatever."
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.620]   So that's the thing is just understanding,
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.900]   like at what point do you give up
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.020]   with a speculation account,
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.900]   and at what point is it too much of your portfolio
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   where it's taking away from the other stuff
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.300]   that it's just easier to do?
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.300]   - I just learned something new.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.420]   I've heard core and explore,
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.080]   but I didn't know what it meant, so now I know.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.920]   That's what--
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.460]   - Yeah, I mean, there's different ways of using it,
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.660]   but core and explore could be a 60/40 fund,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.260]   but instead of 60/40, it's 55/35,
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.420]   and the other 10% is in some sort of alternative strategy,
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.700]   but this is core and explore would be,
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.780]   yeah, your 401(k) is doing the heavy lifting,
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.700]   it's doing the blocking and tackling and the boring stuff,
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.620]   and then in your IRA,
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.380]   you're using speculation a little bit.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.400]   Again, I think for a lot of people,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.540]   the market has made their speculation account
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.460]   much smaller than it was before,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.340]   and it's kind of helped that,
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.420]   but if you keep it to a reasonable amount,
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.100]   and you just want to scratch that itch
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.820]   and play that game a little bit,
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.780]   as long as that lets you keep
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.380]   the rest of your portfolio untouched,
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.540]   that's fine with me.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.020]   - Cool, that makes sense.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.560]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.400]   - Okay.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.300]   I'm 53 and married with two kids to put through college.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.860]   My wife and I earn about $250,000 a year,
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.620]   and the tuitions will cost us $230,000
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.380]   over the next four years.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.300]   I have $1.2 million in cash sitting in liquid savings.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.260]   I had $500,000 in the stock market in my IRAs,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.140]   but I lost $100,000 this year,
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.900]   so now it's $400,000 on paper.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.380]   I'm seeing callable five-year CD rates hitting 3.5%,
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.420]   and it's tempting to invest about one million
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.540]   into these safe, insured CDs
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.620]   to pick up $35,000 a year in guaranteed interest income.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.060]   Because the CDs are callable,
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.700]   the bank may decide to call away their obligation
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.140]   to pay me interest if rates were to pull back
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.660]   in 12 months' time.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.120]   I'm tired of seeing big losses in stocks.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.360]   I will not sell my equities in my IRA
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.240]   because I have a 20-year time horizon,
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.480]   but I'm not feeling confident
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.320]   about adding more money to equities.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.680]   What would you do with the $1.2 million in savings?
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.000]   - All right, this, on the surface,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.360]   sounds like an investment question,
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.080]   and there are some investing implications here,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.220]   but really, this is a financial planning question.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.120]   There are so many moving parts here.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.040]   If I was a normal podcast host,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.480]   I'd say there's a lot to unpack here,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.220]   but I'm not, so I'm not gonna say that.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.720]   So let's bring in a financial advisor to help out with this,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.880]   because this really is just, there's a lot going on here.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.160]   So Blair Ducanet, been on the show before.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.200]   - Hey, Blair. - Hey, Ben.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.440]   - Hey, Duncan.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.000]   - A lot going on here.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.040]   Now, I guess the one, maybe the layup answer here
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.520]   is we're matching assets with liabilities
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.860]   for the college fund, right?
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.620]   We know that that's a liquid thing they need
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.040]   in the next four years, that's easy,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.840]   but a prospect comes to you, and by the way,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.680]   good for this person.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.340]   I don't know what they did to get this liquid savings,
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.760]   whether they sold a house or sold a business,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.320]   or they're just really good savers.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.720]   Obviously, that side of things, they're pretty good at,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.920]   but the investing side of things,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.280]   it sounds like they might need a little help with,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.320]   because they're scared of the stock market,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.680]   they don't know what to do with the cash,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.800]   they wanna just take this one fell swoop
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.160]   and put it all in CDs.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.380]   What do you do when you get someone here
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.880]   who just decides, all right, a bear market has caused me
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.000]   to totally change the way I view the stock market,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.600]   I'm in search of safety now, that's it.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.780]   Like, where do we start here?
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.960]   - Yeah, you hit on a lot of the key points here, Ben.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.440]   The key thing here is this listener needs a financial plan.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.240]   This is all about time horizon, what's the money for,
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.880]   when are you gonna need to spend it?
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.520]   We know about the college savings,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.040]   and kudos to you for saving enough to pay for college,
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.740]   it's very expensive these days.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.920]   Maybe that's where the CDs make sense.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.460]   Go ahead and get the 3.5%, I know they're callable,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.280]   but you'll at least start out at that rate.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.720]   You know there's a short time horizon,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.240]   you don't need to take risk with the money
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.440]   that you have saved for college,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.280]   because it's coming up right now.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.640]   But the rest of the money,
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.000]   sounds like this is long-term money that's for retirement,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.400]   you're both working, and at the end of the day,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.880]   there are benefits, especially right now,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.480]   you've got a huge call option on the market,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.240]   you've got a bunch of money in cash.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.720]   Now, I hear from the question
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.840]   that there's some serious risk aversion here,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.080]   and I understand it's scary to invest money for a long-term.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.520]   But if you have a financial plan,
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.240]   particularly if you engage with a financial planner,
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.360]   that person can show you projections
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.920]   of what your portfolio could be worth in 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.760]   when you're actually gonna be spending
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   the rest of this million, million and a half dollars
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.240]   that you have saved for retirement.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.440]   So don't think of these losses as actual losses,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.480]   and you said that they're on paper, that's true.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.760]   This is just fluctuations in the market.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.600]   And keep in mind, the expected return for stocks
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.880]   goes up when the market goes down.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.960]   So this may be an opportune time to get a plan together,
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.120]   to understand the risks that you're gonna take
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.760]   and the rewards for taking it,
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.520]   and go ahead and invest some of this money
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.360]   for the long-term in a diversified portfolio,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.320]   doesn't have to be 100% stocks.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.360]   You can pick something that matches your risk tolerance,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.440]   some mix of stocks, bonds and cash that'll work for you,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.680]   that you'll be comfortable with.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.600]   I think the most important thing
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.280]   is that you're gonna build this all-weather portfolio
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.320]   that will help you go through not only this bear market,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.960]   but there's going to be more in your lifetime.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.800]   When those storms come, the most important thing
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.720]   is that you stay on the boat, right?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.680]   If the boat's gonna make it through the storm,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.520]   you can't be saved if you jump out.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.360]   So I think with a little financial planning,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   you have a huge opportunity to have a very meaningful
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.440]   and sizable portfolio that you can spend
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.760]   on the things that you wanna do in the future.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.160]   So that's my biggest piece of advice
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.880]   is you need a financial plan.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.000]   - I do, yeah, for sure.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.280]   They need an asset allocation and investment plan,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.680]   and I think you're right.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.080]   You don't have to put all the money into stocks, right?
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   You build the plan based on
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.360]   what your liquidity needs are now,
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.760]   and obviously the big one is college,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.160]   but you're also gonna have who knows what else
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.560]   coming ahead in the years ahead.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.760]   So it could be you take this risk aversion,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.400]   and let's say, Blair, you have a client
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.640]   coming to you with this sort of risk aversion
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.360]   and telling you, "I'm scared, stocks are bad."
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.960]   How do you put that into what an asset allocation should be
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.000]   in terms of thinking, all right,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.960]   well, we're gonna have to balance this
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.800]   a little more for this client
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.760]   because they're obviously gonna need
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.320]   some sort of more stability in terms of bonds or cash
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.160]   to balance out the stocks if they can't handle
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.920]   being fully invested in equities.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.280]   - Yeah, I call this the Goldilocks scenario.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.360]   Not too much, not too little risk.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   And we have expected returns.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.560]   They're just expected returns,
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.160]   but they're based on very reasonable,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.480]   conservative expectations for what a mix of stocks
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.360]   to bonds could earn over time.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.880]   And we can look at what would it be
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.560]   if your portfolio was only 50% in stocks, 50% in bonds?
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.920]   What would that look like in 30 years, most likely,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.360]   with a range of scenarios?
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.840]   What would it look like if you had 60% or 70% in stocks?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.520]   And then the client has the data that they need
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.000]   to make the right decision.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.160]   This feels too hot, this feels too cold,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.360]   this one feels just right,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.480]   and we can make that decision that way.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   - Right, I do think, yeah,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.080]   there has to be some sort of coaching involved, though,
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.880]   to understand that, yes, it feels scary right now,
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.760]   and it's painful to see
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.760]   the market value of your portfolio going down.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.920]   But this really is the Carl Richards, his thing,
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.000]   where it's greed, buy, fear, sell, repeat until broke.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.320]   And again, this person,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.680]   obviously he's done something right.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.000]   They've amassed seven figures in liquid wealth
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.360]   that they're just sitting on,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   and now is not the time to run away from that.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.040]   Now is actually the opportune time to go,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.440]   oh, wait, I have liquidity.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.280]   I should put some of that to work in the stock market
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.420]   because in 10, 20 years,
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.320]   I'm not going to regret that decision.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.560]   And if I do, something else is really wrong with the world
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.160]   where maybe it's not gonna matter anyway.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.360]   But I think that's the idea.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.480]   But yeah, you're right, the nail on the head financial plan.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.360]   Yeah, they need to talk to an advisor, potentially,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.400]   to just get a better idea of,
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.120]   instead of just putting it in that release valve,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.560]   that CD sounds so,
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.760]   Duncan, this is the cash addiction, right?
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.080]   That CD sounds so comforting right now,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.960]   and getting your money and just not seeing it go down.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.640]   But you're gonna regret that decision down the line
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   because you didn't put it in stocks
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.560]   when they were a buying opportunity.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.640]   - Yeah. - I agree.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.520]   - Let's do another one. - Speaking of comfort,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.600]   we have our old friend, iBond, in the next question.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.400]   So up next, I spoke with my financial advisor today
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.960]   about iBonds.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.640]   He was telling me that the composite rate for an iBond
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   is 9%, but this is only for the first six months.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.920]   Thus, I would likely get 4.5% for 12 months.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.840]   Is this correct?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.280]   Is this assuming inflation would decrease
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.360]   after October of 2022?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.640]   Maybe a review of what exactly composite rate means
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.480]   would be helpful.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.920]   I agree, I have no idea what composite rate means.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.760]   - Good idea.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.600]   These iBonds are hot.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.080]   So there was a Washington Post story last week
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.880]   saying that there's been such high demand for these things
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.080]   that it crashed the Treasury Direct website.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.600]   I personally tried to call in,
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.240]   and the wait holding time was like two hours.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.080]   So I wish they would just, I don't know,
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.040]   turn this into an ETF to make it easier for people
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   to invest in these things.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.720]   I know it's difficult.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.560]   But yeah, Blair, let's explain how these work.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.040]   We've talked about this a little bit here,
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.600]   but not really how the meat and the bones in terms of this,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.920]   'cause basically every six months, the rate gets re-rated.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.920]   So that 9% is an annualized return, right?
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.280]   How does this work?
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.200]   - Right, exactly.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.160]   So iBonds, not a very popular quarter
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.800]   of the investing market, but they got a lot of attention.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   Cover of the Wall Street Journal yielding 9.62% as of May,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.400]   and essentially risk-free
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.760]   if you think the United States government
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.440]   is a risk-free asset.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.760]   So I dived in a little bit to what are the,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.160]   dove into the details of how does this really work?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.320]   And you're right.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.880]   The rate is set every six months.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.360]   Every May and November, the Treasury comes out and says,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.120]   "Here's the rate for iBonds."
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.720]   And that rate is based on a fixed rate
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.360]   plus the current rate of inflation in the market.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.280]   That's why we're seeing a high rate right now.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.160]   We have historically high inflation.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.720]   The current bonds, the ones that you would buy right now,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.320]   have a fixed rate of zero plus the inflation rate.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.120]   So it is conceivable that as inflation comes down,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.040]   if inflation actually hit zero again,
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.880]   these bonds for a certain period of time
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.280]   could actually yield zero.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.080]   Probably unlikely.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.320]   So you're right.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.520]   The 9.62% annualized is guaranteed
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.040]   just for the first six months.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.000]   If inflation comes down, that yield will come down,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   but there's still gonna be some yield there.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.960]   The other thing to note about iBonds
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.840]   is they're really meant to be long-term investments.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.120]   So you have to hold them for at least 12 months.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.560]   And if you sell them anytime before five years,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.400]   you actually lose the last three months of interest.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.520]   So iBonds really meant to be long-term investments.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520]   They are safe.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.040]   They are earning a great rate right now.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.080]   You should expect the rate to go down over time
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.920]   if inflation gets under control.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.560]   And a couple of other things to note.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.080]   You have to buy them directly on the Treasury's website,
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.240]   which we heard was overloaded with interest.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.440]   I also was unsuccessful in opening an account online.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.680]   The max that any one person can invest in iBonds per year,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.080]   $10,000.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.320]   That's per social security number and per EIN.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.120]   So you and your spouse can both put 10,000.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.960]   If you have children, you can actually open custodial accounts
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.560]   for each of your children, 10,000 for each of those.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.600]   If you have LLCs and business entities
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.040]   or trusts that have a separate identification number,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.320]   you can also invest 10,000 in those.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.520]   And one thing that people don't also understand is
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.560]   there is a way to get around the 10,000.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.920]   If you have a tax refund when you file your taxes,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.320]   you can choose to have that tax refund
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.600]   invested in iBonds above the 10,000.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.840]   So this can be a great, safe, long-term investment
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.400]   for sort of that liquidity cash bucket
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.720]   that you can build over time.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.040]   But it is a variable rate.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   It will change every six months.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.920]   - Yeah, so they asked if they get 4.5% for 12 months.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.040]   It's actually they get 4.5% more or less for six months.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.160]   And then if inflation goes down to 5%
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.320]   and that's what the new rate is,
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.560]   then they get that 2.5% for six months.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.520]   So that's kind of how it works.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.760]   So your annual return would be probably closer
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.080]   to like 6% or 7% if that's the case.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   If inflation stays high, these rates will stay high too.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.040]   So yeah, maybe our one in the last question
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.400]   should be looking more at iBonds rather than CDs.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.560]   But yeah, getting back to the TSP thing, Duncan,
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.040]   the Thrift Savings Plan, they have like a government bond.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.160]   It's called like the G Fund.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.280]   My brother always says this to me.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.440]   They basically have their own sort of treasury fund in it.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.760]   It's no interest rate risk.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.400]   So it will not lose money.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   And so I think they need to make an iFund for the iBonds
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.600]   so people can just invest in a fund of this
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.480]   and make it easier for people.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.320]   I don't know.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.800]   Again, I've been telling people
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.920]   to take the cap off of these things.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.960]   No one's listening to me.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.000]   - Yeah, we need to start the chant again.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.560]   - You can't make all into the Fed?
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.560]   - I've been trying.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.480]   Yeah, I'm saying I'd like to see
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.840]   a triple levered ETF of iBonds.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.320]   Someone can figure that out, right?
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.160]   - Duncan.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.240]   - Getting a lot of money.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.320]   All right, remember, keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.160]   If you have a question for us,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.120]   email us at thecomponentshow@gmail.com.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.720]   I wanna thank Blair for helping out with her financial ace.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.680]   We appreciate it.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.200]   As always, Duncan was the finest hat for us again today.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   Remember, ask@thecomponentshow@gmail.com
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.520]   and we will see you next time.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.360]   - Bye.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.680]   (upbeat music)
