[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   actual value of this company with 4 million in yearly revenue. If you really want it to be
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.280]   absolutely insane and give it 100 x valuation, it's worth 400 million, whatever goodwill Donald
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.560]   Trump's likenesses, maybe that's another 500 million, but you'll lose a large amount of money,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.160]   I predict if you buy this, the stock market basis things ultimately on earnings and profits. And so
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.960]   what is included in this is key. If he does another TV show, and it becomes a hit again,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.520]   is that included in this? No. If he has another building or his buildings included in this? No,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.240]   the golf course is included. Now what's included in this deal when you buy DJT is apparently
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.000]   just a really... No, you're right, Jake. ...crazy social network that nobody uses. So just be clear
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.960]   what you're buying. You're right. The more sophisticated version of this trading card
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.360]   analogy would be if Donald Trump contributed his brand licensing revenue in perpetuity to
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.960]   the asset. And then it really is a longitudinal forward bet on the Trump name. Yeah.
