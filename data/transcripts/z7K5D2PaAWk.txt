[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   We apologise for the crackling that can be heard in certain parts of the following recording.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.240]   This was due to a fault on the machine that was used to record the original tape
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   and unfortunately is beyond repair.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.240]   However, we do hope that this will not spoil your enjoyment of this message by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640]   are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Galatians
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.960]   in the first chapter.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.640]   And I shall read verses three, four and five.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.880]   "Grace be to you and peace
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.280]   from God the Father
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   who gave himself
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.840]   for our sins
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.520]   that he might deliver us from this present evil world
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.200]   according to the will of God and our Father
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.880]   to whom be glory
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.480]   for ever and ever.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.760]   Amen."
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.600]   Now, I read those three verses not that I propose to attempt to deal
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.160]   with the three verses this evening
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.640]   because indeed
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600]   I propose only to consider one phrase
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.760]   that is to be found
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.480]   in those verses.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.560]   And it is the phrase in the fourth verse
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.360]   where we read
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.840]   that he might deliver us
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.040]   from
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.960]   this
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.360]   present
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.680]   evil world.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.160]   Now, those who were here last Sunday evening will remember that we began
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.640]   a series of considerations
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.840]   on this first chapter
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.360]   of this epistle of Paul
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.280]   to the Galatians.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.640]   And I explained, as I want to explain again,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000]   that we are doing this
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.920]   in order that we may consider together
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.880]   what it is exactly we are doing tonight
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.680]   or at any other time
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   when
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.640]   we come together in this way
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.080]   to listen
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.240]   to the gospel.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.400]   What is this?
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.000]   What are we doing?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Are we clear about that?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360]   Or, I put the question in this way,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.240]   why should we listen to it?
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.400]   Why do I and others who have the privilege of preaching it
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000]   call upon men and women to listen to it?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.040]   Why does the Christian church
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.000]   stand before the world
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.880]   and call upon people
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.200]   to listen
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.280]   to this
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.680]   particular message?
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.800]   Now, I think you'll agree that the moment I put those questions
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.760]   that there is a great deal of confusion
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.840]   with respect to that,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   both with respect to the church and her function,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.600]   both with respect to the gospel and what it is exactly
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.280]   and what it
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.400]   holds out before us.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.280]   Now, it is because
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   of that confusion
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.080]   that it seems to me it is very vital at the time such as this
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.400]   that we should face these matters together.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   And fortunately for us,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.160]   in this first chapter of this epistle to the Galatians,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.040]   the apostle takes up that very matter.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520]   And perhaps more clearly
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.840]   than anywhere else,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.040]   he states
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.640]   the first principles
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.840]   of the gospel.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.080]   You remember that he was driven to do so because of the confused state of the
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.320]   Galatians.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.520]   They were a very simple people, a primitive people,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.040]   a very excitable people from all accounts.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.520]   But the apostle had been there and had preached the gospel and they'd believed it.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.400]   But then somebody else had come
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.840]   and had said something rather different and they'd accepted that also.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.880]   And they were in a state of utter muddle and complete confusion,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.440]   as there are so many today,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.400]   because there are so many vices abroad still
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.200]   as there were in the days of the great apostle.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.160]   And there are people proclaiming what they call is the Christian gospel,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.080]   as these other people were doing,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.560]   to the Galatians.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.680]   And they do nothing but cause confusion.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.040]   What is more important, therefore,
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.120]   than that we should be clear in our minds
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.080]   with regard to the very
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.520]   first principles
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.040]   of this gospel
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.840]   and of the Christian faith.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.600]   Now, last Sunday we therefore started with this great question.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.640]   Why should we listen to it? Well, my reply was that we should listen to it because
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   it is something that claims to come to us with a unique authority.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.880]   It is a good news, a gospel.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.840]   Yes, but we saw that it's a gospel that can be clearly defined.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.440]   It's not uncertain.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.640]   Paul says this is the gospel. There's something else that calls itself gospel,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.840]   but is another gospel which is not a gospel.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.120]   So we can know exactly what it is.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.200]   We didn't believe in this vague, indefinite, nebulous idea of the gospel.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.480]   No, no, the gospel is something very concrete,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.800]   so much so that Paul actually uses these words, you remember.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.200]   "Though we,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.320]   let him be accursed.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.600]   Let the curse of God
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.000]   descend upon him," says the apostle.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   Very well.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   But, after all, the thing to emphasize is this.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.160]   Here is the reason for listening to this.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.880]   This is a message, this is a gospel,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.720]   that was first preached by one called Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.800]   who claimed that he was the Son of God,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.880]   and who gave proof that he was the Son of God,
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.840]   as the apostle reminds us in the first verse of this epistle,
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.360]   in these words, Paul, he says, an apostle,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.480]   not of men, neither by men,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.960]   but by Jesus Christ and God the Father,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   who raised him from the dead.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.480]   Now this is the unique thing,
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.280]   absolutely unique in history.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.960]   Here is one who was crucified and died and was buried
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.200]   and put in a grave and a stone rolled over it,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.480]   but he rose out of it.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.280]   He came out of it in the body,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.000]   and he manifested himself to certain people,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.280]   and then ascended to heaven.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.560]   Here is something absolutely unique.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.040]   Now, we are not detracting from the greatness of men.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.080]   Let us give all due credit and honor and glory to great men.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.920]   It is no part of the preaching of the gospel
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.080]   to depreciate human greatness,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.920]   and there have been very great men
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.080]   and very great thinkers in the world.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.880]   Let's pay due honor and respect to them.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.040]   But this is what I'm saying.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.280]   Here and here alone have we something
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.000]   that claims to be God's own message.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.040]   Not men's ideas with regard to God and men and life,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   God's own revelation.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.440]   You see, it comes back to this.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   This person, this person, this historic person,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.800]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.320]   Now then, if he is the Son of God
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.680]   and has been in this world
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.200]   and has preached and has left this message
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.440]   and has given this message to people like the Apostle Paul
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.880]   and the other apostles,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.560]   well then I say it's a sheer matter of common sense.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.200]   We ought to be looking at this and listening to it
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.080]   for all our life as something absolutely unique.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.920]   That's what the apostle claims for it in this chapter.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.160]   That is what I am privileged to claim for it
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.680]   once more this evening.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.880]   If we had nothing else, that would be enough.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.360]   That's the authority.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now, we always listen to the greatest authority, don't we?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.360]   If we are taken ill, we go to our doctor,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.560]   but we're not quite satisfied.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.160]   We don't seem to be getting well.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.040]   We said, "Do you mind if we call in a higher authority?"
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.520]   Of course.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.600]   And if he doesn't satisfy, he goes still higher.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.320]   You want the highest authority.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.920]   Your legal practitioners, they do the same.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.720]   They're always quoting authorities.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.120]   They want to go to the final court of appeal
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.080]   in the house of lords.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.960]   Perfectly right.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.560]   Let's have the highest authority always.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.440]   The man who doesn't want the best in every realm is a fool.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   Let's always go in for the best.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.400]   Let's get the ultimate authority.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.040]   Well, now, the claim here is that this is God speaking
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.080]   in the person of his son.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.160]   No longer prophets, great men though they were.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.560]   No longer men like Moses.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.880]   No longer Aaron.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.920]   Not even angels.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.240]   God the Son.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.840]   Proof has been given that he is such by his resurrection
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.400]   from the dead.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.560]   Now, then, we must move on.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.280]   We must move on now to consider what this message is in detail.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.720]   I gave you a summary of it last Sunday evening.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.640]   Now we must come back and look at it in detail.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.920]   And as we come to do so, I think we shall find
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   some very interesting things.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.400]   The first thing that will strike us will be this,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.560]   that so many of the ideas that are common and current
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.920]   with regard to what this gospel is are altogether wrong.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.680]   And furthermore, we'll find that they tend
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.400]   to contradict one another.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.000]   That is a very interesting thing to do, you know.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.080]   I commend it to you as an exercise.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.720]   Put down on paper what different people say about this gospel,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.760]   and you'll find that most of them cancel one another out.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.880]   And leave this alone.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.520]   What do I mean?
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.640]   Well, I mean something like this.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.720]   There are so many people who say today, oh, I'm not
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.040]   interested in that gospel.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   I don't go to church.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.680]   I don't listen to it.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.440]   And I don't listen to it for this reason,
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.800]   that it's just something personal.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.160]   People, of course, who are introspective and somewhat
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.680]   morbid, they get themselves into a tangle
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.920]   and are very worried about themselves.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.880]   They forget that they're living in a great world
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.200]   where there have been two world wars.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.960]   And these tremendous armaments are piling up.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.320]   There they are, fancy this, in 1958,
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.160]   with the whole world as it is today.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.320]   They're thinking about their own little souls
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.280]   and their own personal salvation.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.560]   I'm not interested, says the men of the world.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.000]   Too selfish.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.920]   Too self-centered.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.960]   Too small.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.280]   Too narrow.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.880]   I want something that takes in the whole world, the world
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.720]   after.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.120]   Haven't you heard people saying that?
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.800]   Well, but then there's another criticism
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.880]   which is the exact opposite.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.320]   There are some who say, well, as I read my newspapers
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.520]   and see the reports of sermons on this gospel,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.880]   it seems to me that they're all just interested in politics
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.600]   and social matters and the question of war and armaments
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.840]   and bombs and things like that.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   And I'm in terrible trouble myself,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.840]   and there doesn't seem to be anything for me personally.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.360]   You see an exact contradiction of the first one.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.960]   But that's being said quite as much as the first.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:23.120]   And then there are others who say that this gospel is just
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.600]   something fancy and airy and that the real trouble with it
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.880]   is that it doesn't face the facts.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.520]   This is the statement of the hard-headed men of the world,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.560]   the men who always want facts.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.680]   And you say, of course, there are still
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.120]   people in the world, I suppose.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.560]   There's an anachronism in the modern world.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.880]   They rather like singing hymns and things like that
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.680]   and playing with these fairy tales and fancies and fantasies
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.960]   and all this wonderful idea about miracles
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.760]   and incarnations and so on.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.960]   Well, there it is, they say.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   It's also perfectly airy, remote from life,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.760]   doesn't face the hard realities and the facts of life.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.280]   I want something, says a man that
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.920]   will help me to live, that will look the facts straight
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   in the face.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.840]   But then you see immediately they've spoken.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.160]   The next party comes along and says the exact opposite
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.840]   and says, you know, that gospel of yours,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.640]   it makes me feel so uncomfortable and so miserable,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.680]   holds a mirror before me, that it's so depressing.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   I want to get away from all this.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.920]   I want to forget all life's bad enough as it is.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.200]   Surely, let's not be just looking
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.360]   at the evil and the black side.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.320]   Let's look at something that's encouraging.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.840]   You see the exact opposite of the previous one.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.920]   Well, I mustn't keep you with these rather fatuous
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.520]   criticisms, but I mention them because it is just
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.320]   a simple fact that there are thousands, not to say millions,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.280]   of people in the world this evening who are not listening
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.400]   to this gospel at all because they hold some such view
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.680]   with respect to it.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   I can sum them all up by saying that they
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.600]   feel it isn't practical.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.000]   Now, as we come to consider and to analyze
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.080]   what the apostle says about this message in detail,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.800]   we shall see how fatally they all are,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.680]   fatally wrong they all are, when you take them one by one.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.960]   I want to try to show you that this gospel is intensely
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.120]   personal, but at the same time takes in the whole world.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.400]   I want to show you that it not only opens a door into heaven,
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.600]   but looks at man in sin and as he is in this world.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.720]   Yes, it has a spiritual unseen element,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.880]   but it's the most practical, ordinary, direct thing
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.000]   that is addressing the human race this evening.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.200]   These all go astray by looking at one aspect only.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.960]   They don't see the thing as it is,
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.720]   the thing as a whole in all its glorious and amazing
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.560]   completeness.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.080]   Very well, then, let me ask this question.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.240]   On what subjects does this gospel address us?
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.360]   What are the subjects of which it treats?
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.480]   You've invited me to come and listen, says someone.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.320]   Well, now, I want to know, what is it all about?
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.880]   What is this message which you claim to be unique?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.160]   What does it deal with?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.640]   What does it talk about?
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.240]   And my first answer is this.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:31.040]   The first thing it talks about is the world and your position
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.920]   and mine in that world.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.360]   In other words, my text tonight is this--
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:44.880]   to deliver us from this present evil world.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.160]   Very well, let me put it to you like this,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.680]   to show you how practical the gospel is.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.320]   Here we are in this world this evening.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.720]   We find ourselves in it.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.600]   We have no say about our coming into it.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.560]   We just find ourselves in it, in this extraordinary world.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.680]   Age, if you like, it's the same thing.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.480]   From this present evil age is an equally good translation here.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.800]   But let's call it world.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.320]   It is.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.880]   It's the same thing.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.560]   Now, I say we find ourselves in this vast world,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.640]   this complex, complicated world, and especially the world
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.600]   as it is tonight.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.800]   We hear about it on the wireless.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   We read about it in the newspapers.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.520]   The statesmen are concerned about it.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.920]   They have their annual political conferences.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.000]   And they put up their theories and their ideas
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   and their proposals.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.040]   The world, and you and I are in it.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.440]   And we realize its present plight and position.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.000]   Well, now then, surely here is the first question
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.440]   that ought to engage the attention
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.560]   of any thoughtful, thinking person.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.160]   What is this world?
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.880]   What is it?
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.800]   What is life itself?
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.400]   What's it all about?
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.040]   Now, I suggest that if you don't start with that question,
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.800]   you don't know how to think.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.280]   There's the starting point.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.960]   Now, before I come down to any particular problems,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.360]   such as the hydrogen bomb or the race question,
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   or any one of these things that some people seem
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.680]   to regard as the whole business of the gospel and nothing else,
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.360]   now, before I say we come to any particular problems,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.400]   surely we ought to start with the whole.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.360]   Before you start with what's wrong with life,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.880]   you ought to start with this question, what is life?
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.760]   Before you ask what's wrong with the world,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.360]   you ought to ask what is the world?
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.800]   Now then, there I suggest is the first question.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.200]   Can you suggest a question to me behind that?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.880]   There isn't.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.200]   Here's the first thing.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.840]   I find I am standing in this pulpit.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.480]   You are sitting in those pews.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.560]   You are a person.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   I'm a person.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.320]   We are in this world.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.360]   We are living.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.400]   But what am I?
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.720]   What is life?
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   What is this age?
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.120]   What is this world?
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.560]   What's it all about?
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.160]   Very well, here's the first thing
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.400]   you see with which the gospel deals.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.480]   And I want to expound to you this evening
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.920]   what the apostle tells us here is the message of the gospel
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.640]   with respect to the world.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.480]   Yes, I'm taking the whole world, the whole cosmos.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.040]   This gospel, which some people think
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.280]   is nothing but purely personal and introspective and morbid,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.520]   starts with the whole world, the entire universe,
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.440]   this present evil world.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.880]   Now, if we are to get the full force of what the apostle says,
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.240]   I think the best way is for us to consider it
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:04.640]   by way of contrast with the prevailing view, which
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.480]   is non-Christian, with respect to the world and life and men
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.800]   and what it's all about.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.440]   That's the best way of showing what the gospel says.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.800]   Let's start with other ideas about it all,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.040]   these non-Christian ideas, the ideas of people
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.160]   who scoff at Christianity and laugh at it
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.480]   and dismiss it with scorn.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.800]   What are these non-Christian views of the world?
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.400]   Well, we can put them all in this form.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.520]   First and foremost, they say the world
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:42.840]   is something that has evolved and come
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.320]   into being in and of itself.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.520]   And that includes men.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.920]   Look at the world, they say, the whole cosmos.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.240]   Well, it's just something that's happened.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.320]   It's just there.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.680]   Well, you say, but has it always been here?
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.520]   Has it always been like this?
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.800]   Oh, no, they say.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:13.880]   There was once a time when it was just gases floating about.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.720]   And then they seemed to settle down
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:23.200]   into two big kind of spheres, globes, as it were.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.920]   And then at a given point, those two
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.800]   passed a little bit too near to one another,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.760]   and one knocked off a piece of the other.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.320]   And that fell into space, and it became our universe.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.520]   Well, I needn't keep you.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.640]   You're familiar with the teaching.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.560]   It's so popular, it's constantly being put before us
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.560]   in the newspapers, and it's given to the schoolchildren
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.040]   on the wireless and everywhere else.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.760]   It's the thing that is assumed by everybody today,
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.600]   that the world just happened.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.640]   Nobody knows how nor why, but there it is.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.000]   And men, in turn, has just evolved
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.680]   by the result of the interaction and operation
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.640]   of some quite impersonal forces, which they give capital letters
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.920]   to and call them energy with a capital E.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.960]   And somehow or another, this has produced
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.800]   man after a painful process of coming up
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.000]   through the various animal stages.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.240]   Now, that's it.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.760]   In general, the world and men have just evolved,
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.880]   and nobody knows how.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.760]   The second thing that is believed in general
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:35.880]   is that the world is something very good and bright and friendly
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.840]   and full of joy.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.680]   The world is often contrasted, isn't it,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.440]   in that sense, with religion.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.520]   Religion is that which makes people happy.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.720]   Life of the world, life of joy, wonderful.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.640]   Listen to the dancing, the shouting, and the laughter,
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.920]   and the music.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.040]   What a happy place the world is.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.680]   And fancy people sitting in a chapel on Sunday night,
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.480]   when they might be so happy, taking all
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.720]   that the world has got to give them.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.520]   The world is a good place.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.080]   It's full of good things and good ideas of brightness and joy.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.520]   It's very friendly.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.520]   It wants to help us.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.600]   Oh, the world is all right.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.560]   The heart of the universe is sound.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.640]   There's great joy to be found in following it
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.960]   and its way of life.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.840]   That's the assumption.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.800]   They still say things like that.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.640]   That is still the view that is held.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.400]   And then another thing they say is this,
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.320]   that the world is something which
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.000]   is improving and developing towards perfection.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.520]   The more honest will grant that it isn't quite perfect yet.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.800]   But they say it's moving towards it.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.200]   It's evolved a tremendous distance.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.000]   It's altogether better than it used to be.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.880]   Think, for instance, of people 100 years ago.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.680]   Thank God, I nearly said, but--
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.280]   well, they do say thank God, though they
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.160]   don't believe in him.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.840]   Thank God, they say we are alive now and not 100 years ago.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.320]   What an existence that was.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.680]   None of the things that have made life so wonderful for us.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.120]   Life is evolving.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.960]   The whole world is moving forward.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.160]   It's going up.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.480]   And man with it is evolving in the direction
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.760]   of a final, absolute perfection.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.880]   But it's so much better than it was.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.640]   And it'll go on and on and on, improving
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.920]   until it reaches that final state of perfection.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.880]   And then, therefore, the last thing which they say is this,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.520]   that the great thing to do is, of course, to enjoy the world.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.960]   Go into it and enjoy it to the full.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   And at the same time, do as much as you
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.480]   can to help in this process of betterment and improvement.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.120]   Give a push, as it were, to the wheel of progress.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.560]   Let's make it advance a little bit more rapidly
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.960]   than it's done in the past.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.280]   We've been doing very well, really, in the last 50 years
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.560]   with our acts of parliament and all our schemes.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.080]   We have really accelerated the pace tremendously.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.440]   It's simply astonishing how much superior
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.800]   the world is, therefore, to what it was 100 years ago and so on.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.040]   Now, you're familiar with it.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.000]   That is this view.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.040]   This is something that, well, it just is.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.760]   And there's nothing but this.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.920]   This world is everything.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.480]   It's the only world.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.840]   And the thing to do is to live for it
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.000]   and live in it to the maximum and help
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.560]   to make it still better.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.640]   So we must all give our time and our energy
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.160]   to doing that, enjoying it and helping it on
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.800]   in this process of improvement.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:36.760]   I think you'll agree that that is the common view of the world
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.120]   and of men, apart from the view which
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   we have in this book, which we call the Bible.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.680]   Now, then, it is because of that that the Bible calls
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.960]   us to listen to its message.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:55.400]   It is because that view is so fatally and dangerously wrong
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.480]   that I plead with you to listen to this gospel.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.080]   Is that a true account of this world?
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.480]   Is that an accurate description in any respect?
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.120]   Well, listen to what this apostle has got to say.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.840]   I suggest to you it's the exact opposite.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.240]   "Who gave himself for our sins, why?
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:26.880]   That he might deliver us from this present evil world."
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.040]   There's his answer.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.400]   That's the biblical view.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.120]   Let me expound it to you.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.000]   The first thing, in other words, that the Bible tells us
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.360]   about the world is that this is only the present world.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.760]   This is the present age.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.440]   What do you mean by that, sir, someone?
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.120]   Well, no, we must go all the way back.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.840]   We must look at it from the very beginning.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.400]   We must take a big, comprehensive view
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.720]   of the biblical teaching with regard to the world.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.520]   What is the world?
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.480]   How has it come into being?
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.600]   And the answer which we find here is this,
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.360]   that God created the world.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   It isn't something that's just happened.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.720]   How could it have happened?
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.360]   I ask you in the name of reason and common sense
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.640]   how any impersonal force could turn gases
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.280]   into the modern, complex, complicated world.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.480]   God created the world.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.640]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.880]   and all that in them is.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.360]   Now, let's be clear about this.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.920]   God made a perfect world.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.880]   And he made men as a part of it and put them into it.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.520]   Very well, but you see, something's happened.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.800]   This present evil world, says the apostle--
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.480]   I want to emphasize this present.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.440]   The whole suggestion at once is that this
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.880]   is only a temporary world.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.520]   It isn't permanent.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.680]   Now, that's the fatal thing about that other view
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.400]   that I've just outlined to you.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.320]   It regards this world as permanent, solid, fixed,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.200]   eternal.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.560]   There's nothing but this.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.000]   No, no, says the Bible.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.280]   Even the world itself is only temporary, present, evil world.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.440]   Right, let's go back again.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.880]   God made this world perfect.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.560]   But then something went wrong.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.960]   Men sinned and a curse came down upon the world.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.840]   And you see, the Bible tells us that the world
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.920]   that God made at the beginning was destroyed.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.960]   It was destroyed in the flood.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.680]   God destroyed that first world, as it were, that first age.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.720]   He destroyed it completely, apart
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.920]   from a family of eight people, Noah and his family.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.440]   That old age was blotted out, entirely out of existence.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.520]   A new age came in.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.120]   You see how the Bible looks at these things.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.120]   This isn't permanent.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.720]   No, no.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.920]   Well, now then, here we are in this present age.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:18.320]   But, says the apostle, as does the Bible everywhere,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.920]   even this is temporary.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.760]   Even this, everything you see in it, men included,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.600]   it's only for a while.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.800]   The Bible talks about this present world, this present age.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.440]   And then it talks about the age to come, the world to come.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.360]   It's here everywhere.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.760]   It was in the preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.960]   This apostle and the other apostles speak of it.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.560]   Did you notice it in that second epistle of Peter, chapter 3?
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.840]   We look for a new heavens and a new earth.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.520]   That's the age to come.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.760]   This is a passing age.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.840]   The world, we are told, and its kingdoms are passing away.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.080]   There is another world to come.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.600]   Another age is yet to be.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.360]   So we must get rid of this notion entirely
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.640]   that this is permanent.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.200]   No, no.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.520]   It's only present.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.960]   And we must realize that it's only temporary
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.040]   and for a given purpose.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.280]   Indeed, the Bible goes so far as to say this,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.720]   that the time of the end of this present world
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.760]   is already fixed and determined by God.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.720]   He started it.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.160]   He will end it.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.200]   Doesn't that make a tremendous difference
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.840]   to your view of the world and of yourself in it
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.200]   and of the whole of life?
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.880]   You mustn't confine your thinking
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.200]   to the visible, to the seen.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.840]   All that we see is something that
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.280]   is in the hands of this almighty God.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.040]   And he's made it only for a while,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.840]   for a time, present, temporary.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:04.760]   So the man who begins to live for this world
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.640]   and to think only in terms of this
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.760]   is in the most precarious position possible.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.960]   The world is spinning round and round only
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.720]   until God has decided to stop it.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.240]   And this age will have come to an end.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.280]   And the age to come will be ushered in.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.040]   Now there at once, you see, we are looking down
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.440]   upon the world as it were.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.800]   We are looking at it from the standpoint of eternity.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   And we see that all that seems so solid and secure and certain
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.160]   to us is most insecure.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.600]   Very well, there is his first word, present.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.040]   But let me hurry to the second, which is evil.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:52.040]   And this is the most amazing thing of all,
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   how anybody can dispute this proposition,
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.520]   that this present world, far from being
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:05.000]   a good and a wonderful and a marvelous place, is evil.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.200]   Now I was saying just now that some people object
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.640]   to this gospel because it isn't realistic,
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.520]   because it's a sort of pie in the sky that
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.000]   doesn't face the facts.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.720]   Well, now then, please don't object
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.760]   if I ask you to face the facts.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.800]   And don't say that I'm going to be morbid.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.000]   And don't say that I'm making you feel miserable.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.520]   You either want facts or you don't.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.960]   If you do, well, here they are.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.120]   The world that you and I are living in is evil.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.480]   This present evil world.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.200]   What does he mean?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.760]   He means this.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.600]   It doesn't conform to God's pattern.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.520]   It isn't straight.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.080]   It isn't true.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.600]   It isn't right.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.160]   It's lost the upright.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.280]   It's gone astray.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.520]   It's fallen off.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.880]   It's an evil world.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.400]   Yes, it is an evil world, you see,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:02.440]   because not only does it not obey God,
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.400]   not only is it opposed to God, it
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:14.600]   is controlled by the power that exists and lives in order
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.800]   to hate and to oppose God.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.160]   It is an evil world according to this teaching.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.560]   And you find it everywhere, I say again in the scriptures,
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:31.280]   because it is a world that is under the dominion of Satan,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:38.440]   governed by the devil, governed by the God of this world,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.240]   in the grip of a malign, infernal, hateful power,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:49.160]   whose one object and ambition is to wreck God's perfect work
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.640]   to spite God.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.320]   Evil world.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.240]   But is this true?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.560]   Well, let's go on with our analysis.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.840]   The word, the term evil, means this,
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.640]   that there is a vicious principle at work in this world
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.840]   and controlling it, and leading it to that which is wrong,
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.240]   leading it to the breaking of laws,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.280]   leading to confusion, and all the horrible consequences
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.920]   of law-breaking.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.600]   Now, that's what the Bible says about the world,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.680]   that there is a vicious power at work.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.720]   Listen again to this apostle as he
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.880]   writes to the Ephesians.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.640]   "We wrestle not against flesh and blood."
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.920]   Well, what then?
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.120]   "Oh, against principalities and powers,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.440]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.680]   against spiritual wickedness in high places,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.720]   in heavenly places."
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.440]   In other words, he means this, you see,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.280]   that there is a principle of evil at work in the world.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.080]   Think of men whom everybody would agree are evil men
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   and evil livers.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.240]   Why are they like that?
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.000]   The answer is that this evil principle,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   this vicious principle, is controlling them, and using
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.520]   them, and governing them, and making
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.200]   them do the things they do.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.320]   And we're all, according to this teaching,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.760]   face to face with these powers and these influences that
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.080]   are so vile and so vicious.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.280]   And what do they lead to?
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.480]   Well, they lead to ugliness.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.400]   They lead to disorder.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.920]   They lead to lawlessness.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.720]   They lead to unhappiness.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.880]   Evil always leads to those consequences.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.520]   Evil invariably makes things ugly.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.040]   It's a smear on the face of beauty.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.680]   Evil, because it is the breaking of a law,
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.520]   always leads to lawlessness.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.160]   And in exactly the same way, evil,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.800]   because it breaks into harmony, leads to unhappiness,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.040]   and confusion, and heartbreak.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.160]   And what is so astonishing to me is that anybody could
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.560]   possibly dispute that who has eyes to see at the present
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.520]   time.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.560]   How can anybody dispute this proposition that the world in
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.800]   which we're living is an evil world?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.560]   Look at it.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.880]   Look at the increasing ugliness of life.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.720]   As the religious influence wanes more and more and goes
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.960]   into the background, doesn't life become more and more ugly
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.200]   even to look at?
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.640]   And look at the lawlessness.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.760]   Why is there this lawlessness?
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.000]   Why is there all this talk about juvenile delinquency and
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.240]   the problem of the adolescents, the teddy boys,
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.600]   and all these things?
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.960]   What's the matter?
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.200]   Well, where does this lawlessness come from?
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.800]   The Bible says there's only one answer.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.720]   It is this evil principle.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.480]   It's there.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.440]   It's operating.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.640]   It's mastering.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.880]   It is controlling.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:06.000]   Think of the unhappiness in the world this evening.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.880]   Think of the broken hearts.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.000]   Think of the wounded hearts, and minds, and spirits.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.880]   Think of the soreness.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.040]   Think of the suffering.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.560]   What's it all due to?
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.760]   In every single instance, we can trace it back to evil,
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.920]   some selfishness, some self-concern at the expense of
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.080]   others, some argument which says, what's it matter as long
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.640]   as I get what I want?
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.760]   That's why the world is as it is.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.680]   And it's unhappy.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.760]   It's miserable.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.880]   It's confused.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.680]   It's in a state of lawlessness.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.480]   And we're baffled by the immensity of our problems.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.920]   What's it due to, my friends?
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.600]   Is it due to the fact that this world is a good place and a
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   friendly place?
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.680]   Isn't it obvious?
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.280]   It's due to this vile, evil, vicious principle that is
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.160]   there in life, insinuating itself into the minds, and
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.680]   hearts, and imaginations of men and women.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:08.360]   Examine your own self.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:15.240]   Where do our evil thoughts come from?
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.880]   Where do our evil imaginations originate?
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.480]   When you wake up in the morning and the first thought is a
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.160]   vile one, where did you get it?
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.000]   Who put it there?
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.600]   Did you?
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.360]   Of course you didn't.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.520]   You haven't started thinking.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.760]   It came to you.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:33.920]   The apostle talks in writing to the Ephesians about the
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.160]   fiery darts of the evil one.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.880]   And he's hurling them at us.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.920]   He's hurling at us, every one of us, into your mind, into
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.880]   your imagination, into your thoughts, in devious ways.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.280]   This evil, vile, vicious principle is being thrown at
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.800]   us, injected into us.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.960]   It's everywhere.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.840]   The whole principle of the world in which we live is
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.800]   against us, and against our highest and
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.040]   our best interests.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:09.840]   And according to this teaching, these influences
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.680]   control us, all of us who are born into this world.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.000]   That is why it's such an easy thing to go wrong.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.400]   It doesn't take a genius to go wrong and to sin.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.920]   My dear friend, if you want to sin, you've just got to
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.920]   follow the crowd tonight.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.160]   That's what they're doing.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.720]   It's not, you know, a difficult thing to follow the
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.400]   crowd as it drinks or gambles or does any of the things that
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.960]   it does and gives way into its passions and lusts.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.120]   It doesn't take greatness to do that.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.400]   Everybody's doing it.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.680]   Any fool can do it.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.920]   Every fool is doing it.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:49.600]   It's because they're governed and controlled by this
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.160]   vicious principle.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.040]   It's easy to follow the crowd to float down the stream, and
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.480]   the world encourages us to do so.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.440]   It does it in--
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.520]   I needn't keep you--
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.720]   you know how it does it?
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.320]   How difficult it is to keep a clean mind in this modern
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.400]   world, isn't it?
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.000]   You get up in the morning and as an intelligent person, you
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.400]   want to know what the news is.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.320]   You want to take an intelligent interest in these
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.720]   affairs as a Christian man or woman.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.080]   I'm not a preacher about these things, but as Christian
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.840]   citizens, we're all to be concerned about them.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.040]   Very well, I want to know what's happening in the world.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.240]   I look at my newspaper, yes, but with one eye, I see that
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.360]   important news with another.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.480]   I see something that immediately does me harm the
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.040]   moment I look at it.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:41.760]   Panders to the flesh, arouses lusts and evil desires.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.240]   It's everywhere in our newspapers.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.120]   It's in our films.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.400]   It's in our books, in our novels, in all the teaching.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.440]   It's on the hoardings.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.400]   It's everywhere.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.280]   It's a difficult thing, I say, for a young man or a young
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.400]   woman to be clean and straight and chaste and moral in this
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.240]   present world.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:00.560]   Why?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.800]   Well, all this is surrounding us.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.960]   And where's it come from?
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.600]   Ah, but you say it's men.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.600]   But what makes a man do a thing like that?
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.920]   Why do people delight in doing it and delight to make money
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.040]   out of that kind of thing?
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.160]   Oh, there's only one answer.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.120]   It's this evil principle.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:24.360]   It is this present evil world which has got control of these
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   means and methods of propagation and all this money
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.520]   and wealth, and it's all working to one end.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.040]   Fashions, everything, it's all working in the direction of
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:41.120]   evil and making the moral fight more and more difficult,
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.360]   but still more serious.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:53.160]   It leads us to oppose God and to oppose that which is right.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.080]   I've often put it like this before.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.920]   Why do we all at a given age think that we're being very
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.720]   wonderful and very clever when we criticize religion?
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:09.240]   Why should we, when we're adolescents, look forward to
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.560]   the age when we'll no longer be forced to go to Sunday
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.600]   school or the chapel and can go out into the world and
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.800]   rarely begin to live?
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.280]   Why should we think that's wonderful?
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.240]   Why should it be wonderful to oppose God and oppose truth
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.720]   and right and honor and chastity and purity?
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.800]   That's what he teaches.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.240]   Why should it be something to be laughed at, to desire to
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.120]   know God and to pray to him?
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.640]   Why should the jokes against religion be always so
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.280]   excruciatingly funny?
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:46.680]   Why?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.200]   Have you ever faced that?
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:48.960]   Why not?
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   Now, what's wrong with God, if I may ask with reverence?
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.120]   What's wrong with the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.200]   What's wrong with the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.800]   My dear friend, haven't you realized if only we were all
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.880]   living the Sermon on the Mount, there'd be no need to
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.720]   worry about bonds or anything else.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.880]   The world would be paradise.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.520]   It would be perfect.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.720]   And yet, you see, it's regarded as one of the best jokes to
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.760]   make fun of that sort of thing, to ridicule it, and to
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.440]   think that you're clever for doing so.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.560]   What is that?
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.960]   Well, to me, there's only one answer.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.400]   That's evil.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.480]   That's just evil.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.120]   That's this vicious principle.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.520]   It's this hatred of God.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.080]   It is this hatred of truth.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.760]   It is this hatred of all that is worthy of our praise and
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.000]   of our adoration.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:44.960]   It is this vicious principle that ever suggests to us that
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.200]   the more animal we are, the more wonderful we are.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.760]   The more we listen to and obey the lowest that is in us, the
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.840]   more we've emancipated ourselves, and the more we're
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.360]   really living as men and women.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.160]   Oh, my dear friend, if you want facts, there they are.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.000]   This present world is an evil world.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:15.800]   Anybody who's ever been concerned about truth and
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   these eternal principles knows it's evil.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.080]   What a difficult thing, I say, it is to keep straight, to
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.880]   keep clean, to keep pure.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.680]   Everything's against you.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.320]   You've got to fight for your life.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.320]   Many a man's left it and has gone into a monastery.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.120]   But even when he got there and couldn't see the hoardings
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.400]   and the films and all the glamour and the light and the
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.680]   ugliness and the suggestion on the streets, alone in the
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.520]   cell, it followed him there.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.760]   It was inside him.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.960]   This vicious principle.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.640]   The world is evil.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.720]   And all of us who are in it and who belong to it have evil
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.600]   within us.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.440]   Indeed, this apostle in writing to the Romans put it
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.120]   like this.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.520]   He said, in me, that is to say in my flesh,
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.600]   dwelleth no good thing.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.720]   Every one of us is a mass of corruption.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.120]   Am I insulting you?
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.480]   Well, I'm saying it about myself.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.720]   And you are a mass of corruption.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.400]   In me, that is to say in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.480]   It's rotten.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.600]   It's vile.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   It's foul.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.840]   It's unclean.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.560]   That's the world.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.320]   Oh, but I must say one other thing about it before I
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.200]   close, it's not only a passing present world, it's not only
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:44:00.120]   evil, it's a doomed world who gave himself for us that he
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:07.160]   might deliver us from this present evil world.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.920]   It cannot be delivered.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.400]   It is doomed.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.240]   It is under the curse.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.080]   It is damned.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.720]   It is condemned.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.360]   It is under the wrath of God.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.720]   Let me put this very plainly.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.680]   This world is not improving.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.440]   Now, I say that that is something that
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.400]   facts alone can prove.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   Can you prove to me that this world is improving?
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.240]   Well, if it is, why is the world as it is?
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.400]   Is this the improvement?
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.520]   Is the present state of society and the
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.000]   international situation, is that the improvement you're
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.240]   talking about?
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.560]   Not only is the world not improving, I'll go further,
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   the world cannot be improved.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.920]   Oh, but you say you're just being sure, pessimistic at
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.640]   this moment.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.680]   My dear friend, I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.400]   I am trying to be realistic, and I'm giving you facts.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.200]   And I can prove to you that the world cannot be improved in
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.680]   this way.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:10.920]   From the dawn of known history and civilization, men and
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   women have been trying to improve this world.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.720]   They've been at it now many thousands of
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.520]   years, haven't they?
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.000]   I ask again, where is the evidence of the improvement?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.720]   Oh, but you say we've got a National Health Service now,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.240]   and they didn't have that so long.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.080]   Well, now, wait a minute.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.120]   It depends upon your standards, doesn't it?
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:37.000]   I'm asking you to test this question in terms of this evil
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.120]   principle, this vileness, this viciousness.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.920]   Oh, but you say, look at Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:51.160]   And alas, the only reply I make to that is this.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.640]   Yes, look at Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.400]   And then look at London tonight.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:07.480]   And make a list of all the sins committed in ages past.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.800]   Every one of them is committed tonight.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.680]   Where's your improvement?
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.960]   No, no, the world cannot be improved.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.160]   History's been trying to improve it.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.960]   The whole man's effort in civilization, all the thinking
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.760]   of the philosophers, all the work of the
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.000]   politicians and statesmen.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.560]   They've all been trying to improve it.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.880]   It cannot be improved.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.400]   It's as bad as it ever was.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.560]   And the Bible goes so far as to say that it will remain like
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.280]   that--
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.320]   our Lord used these words--
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:42.560]   as they were in the days of Noah, even so shall they be in
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.320]   the days of the Son of Man.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.640]   As they were in the days of Sodom, even so shall they be
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.480]   in the days of the Son of Man.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.760]   Look that up in Luke chapter 17 for yourself.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.320]   There is this Son of God, this highest authority saying
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.160]   that the world at the end is going to be as it was at the
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:01.640]   beginning.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.280]   Why?
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:06.600]   Evil remains, and all our playing and tinkering on the
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.080]   surface doesn't change the character and the
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.280]   nature of the world.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.720]   Minor improvements, retrogression in other
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.800]   respects, but evil remains in the human heart
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.280]   as it has always been.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.760]   The fact is the world is under judgment.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.440]   The Bible holds out no hope whatsoever for this world.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.880]   It tells us, in the words of John Bunyan, that this world
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.080]   is the city of destruction, and that there's only one
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.600]   thing to do, and that is to get out of it as quickly as you
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.640]   can to make your escape, as the pilgrim did.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.840]   The world is under the wrath of God.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.640]   This world is going to be destroyed.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.760]   You see, I told you it's only a temporary world.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.280]   It's only this present world.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.560]   It is going to be destroyed, not again by a flood, as you
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   remember Peter put it, but by fire this time.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.960]   The elements will melt with fervent heat.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.360]   The whole cosmos shall be ablaze.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.920]   The heavens shall be burning.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.440]   Everything shall be purged of evil.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.480]   We look, he says, for a new heavens and a new earth,
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.840]   wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.560]   There is an age to come.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.840]   This world is doomed.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.240]   It cannot be saved.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.000]   It cannot be improved.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.960]   It itself is going to be destroyed, because it's under
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.040]   the curse and the wrath of God.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.800]   Very well.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.240]   That is the teaching of this message with regard to the
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.160]   world, my friend.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.880]   Don't you see how revolutionary it is?
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.040]   Don't you see what it makes of all the things to which men
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.480]   pin their faith, and to which they cling still with vain
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.040]   hopes, and go on clinging, though the facts prove them to
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.360]   be wrong, if they but rarely face them?
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.120]   There it is.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:56.880]   That's the world.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.440]   And you and I are in it.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.280]   And what is true of the world is true of every one of us
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.800]   that is born into the world.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.360]   This world is in us.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.640]   And we are in it at one and the same time.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.560]   We are evil.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.800]   We are vile.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:15.880]   What do we need?
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.680]   Do we need, therefore, to be exalted, or to
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.760]   improve this world?
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.640]   Isn't it ridiculous?
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.760]   When you know the world can't be improved, how can it be a
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.680]   gospel to urge people to improve it?
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.320]   No, no.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.520]   The message of the gospel is this, that we need to be
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.640]   delivered from this present evil world.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.120]   It's our only hope.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.040]   We must get out of the city of destruction.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.280]   That's its message.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.680]   How can we do so?
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.880]   We cannot do so.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.320]   Try as you will to get out of it.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.400]   As I say, escape into a monastery.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.760]   Become a monk or a hermit on top of a mountain.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.280]   Take up this hermetic view.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.520]   Do anything you like.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.880]   You'll find the world is always with you because the
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.120]   world is in you.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   No, the only thing to do is to listen to the voices of the
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.760]   prophets of the Old Testament, to listen to the last of them,
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.280]   John the Baptist, who went and preached and said, "Flee
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.560]   from the wrath to come." The Son of God said it.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.040]   "Flee from the wrath to come." Get out of it.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.560]   Get away from its influence.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.280]   Get away from its doom.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.680]   Disentangle yourself.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.880]   You belong to it.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.600]   And if you remain in it, its doom will come upon you.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.800]   You must be delivered from it.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.200]   How can we be delivered?
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   Where is deliverance possible?
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:50.000]   Oh, I tell you again, as I told you last Sunday evening,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.640]   there is only one who can do it.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.520]   We are so tied to the world and so involved in it that we
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:01.280]   can't disentangle and extricate ourselves.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.080]   We haven't got that mighty Excalibur that can sever the
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.400]   ties and set us free.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.560]   Have you ever tried to liberate yourself?
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.960]   Have you tried to liberate your mind or your heart or
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.120]   your imagination?
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.560]   Have you ever tried to live the pure and the holy and the
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.760]   clean and the godly life?
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   Well, go and try it.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.720]   And you'll find you can't.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.560]   You'll fail.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.640]   Greater men than you and I have tried and failed.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.160]   Look at them.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.400]   Read their stories.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.480]   And Augustine, and Luther, and all these men, fasting,
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.960]   sweating, praying.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.680]   And yet as a mighty chorus, they sing together, not the
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.400]   labors of my hands.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.120]   Can fulfill thy laws demands.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.480]   Could my zeal, no respite, no.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.000]   Could my tears forever flow.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.600]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.720]   Thou must save.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:00.320]   And thou alone, and thank God he has.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.880]   Who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.720]   this present evil world according to the will of God
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:13.880]   and our Father, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.800]   Amen.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.720]   Oh, in spite of all that is so true of the world and of us,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:28.000]   in sin, God, in his everlasting love, sent his only
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.880]   begotten son into it in order that he might deliver us out
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.280]   of it from its influence, its enticements,
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.240]   its vicious principle.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.320]   Yes, and from its doom.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.240]   So that there is only one thing that you and I can do.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.840]   There, involved inextricably in the world and unable to set
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.200]   ourselves free, oh, my dear friend, I'm glad to tell you
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.920]   there's only one thing for you to do.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.280]   Where you are, in your hopeless serfdom, in the midst of
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.840]   vice and evil, cry out unto him.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.120]   And he'll hear you.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.160]   And he'll manifest the glory of his power in your life.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.240]   He'll take hold of you.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.720]   And he'll pull you out.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.640]   And he'll sever the ties.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.560]   And he'll put you in his own kingdom.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.960]   He will have delivered you from this present evil world
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.880]   while you're still alive in it.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.520]   You won't belong to it.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.120]   You won't be under its curse.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.200]   You won't be involved in its doom.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.960]   And already, he will have separated you, even from its
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.480]   vicious, evil grip.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.520]   Cry out unto him.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:52.640]   And he will, because he can, deliver you and set you free.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.880]   Amen.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.680]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.080]   Martin Lloyd-Jones.
