[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.160]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.840]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I want to tell a little bit of a story before I get into
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.560]   today's conversation.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.600]   In the 1960s, six boys from Tonga were shipwrecked on a remote Pacific
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.840]   island for 15 months.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.880]   And you might be thinking it turned into something like Lord of the Flies, a
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.360]   descent into violence, but that is not what happened.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.480]   In fact, it was the polar opposite of that novel, which most of us had to read
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.160]   in school.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.800]   And while in the fictitional book, boys descended into anarchy, murder, mayhem,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.360]   in the real world, they actually got along well, they developed structure,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.080]   they took care of those who were injured.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.640]   And when they were found after 15 months, they were doing great.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.880]   They were fit, they were healthy.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.440]   So why is this book Lord of the Flies so much bleaker than reality?
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.320]   Why did kindness end up actually ruling in real life?
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.600]   Well, author Rucker Berman introduced this story and others in a recent book
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.560]   called Humankind, A Hopeful History.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.640]   And he makes the case pretty convincingly that humans are basically kind, and they
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.840]   do better and thrive when they are kind.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.720]   And that kindness is more human of a trait than cruelty.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   So if we can do better when we're kind, how do you hone and improve that ability?
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.000]   Well, that thought had me so intrigued by the title of Adrian Bankert's book,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.760]   Your Hidden Superpower, the kindness that makes you unbeatable at work and
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.920]   connects you with anyone.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.400]   And I'm so excited to be talking about it today.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   Adrian's an Emmy Award winning journalist who's reported on stories from all over
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.560]   the world, interviewed hundreds of people and celebrities.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.440]   She was a correspondent and weekend anchor on ABC's Good Morning America.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.880]   And she's the first woman of color to solo host a morning show as host of
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.800]   Morning in America.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.840]   But her hallmark is kindness, and it's been a huge factor in her success and
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.520]   ultimately led her to write her book.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.880]   Adrian, welcome to the show and thank you so much for being here.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.400]   Great story.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   It's funny because it's not always true.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.200]   I recently interviewed a guy named Brandon Presser, who's a travel journalist, and
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.760]   he wrote about the Pitcairn Islands, which is quite more of the Lord of the Rings
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   truth, but also was much older people escaping tyranny and a little bit
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.480]   crazier. So I just want to start and read part of the first chapter of your book,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.160]   because I think it sets the stone for a conversation, which is there is an
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.080]   unbeatable superpower inside every one of us that is far greater than talent or
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.840]   tenacity. It supersedes strength and intelligence.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.320]   It crushes selfishness, negativity and doubt.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.560]   That's kindness you're speaking of.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   And that superpower is something I really want to understand.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.000]   Could you just jump in and explain how it's a superpower that could do all of
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   those things?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   Well, I gave a keynote speech just recently here, and my title of the speech
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.960]   was "The Purpose of Your Power."
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.240]   I think that people forget that kindness isn't just a pleasant thing to do.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.320]   It's not just good etiquette.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.600]   It's not just the way we should behave as if we're completely oblivious to the
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.320]   world going sideways around us.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.960]   But it's a choice.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.840]   It's a very intentional choice.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560]   And the purpose behind it is to provide stability to other people.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.320]   Right now, we're in the midst of a very uncertain time in multiple areas.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.520]   Just turn on the news.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.640]   And a lot of people are going through personal battles that we don't even know
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.800]   about. And inside of them, they're just hoping that somebody will be kind to
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   them, that somebody will remember them, that somebody will call them and tell
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.200]   them it's OK. And I think that a lot of times with kindness, we think, oh, I've
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.120]   got to try really hard to be a good person or, oh, you know, I've got to give
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   these people a break and be nice to them.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.320]   And it's funny because now that I've worked on kindness for a while, I don't
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.800]   know that I would say it's inherently who we want to be as people.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.760]   I think that a lot of times we want to just get the quick fix or we can be
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   selfish. But I think it's the thing that we all crave to receive from other
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.720]   people. And so when we give people the one thing that we universally want,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.320]   somebody to be kind to us, somebody to treat us in a humane fashion, someone to
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.760]   think of us, to remember us, to be friendly to us, then the power behind
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.520]   that is that not only does that person get helped, but we become inspired, we
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.280]   become encouraged, we become more the person that we really do desire to be,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.080]   but don't always act in alignment with.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.680]   And so I think there's something very powerful about giving someone the
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   consideration that has a mutual reciprocity, that has that power to put
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.040]   us in a better mood and them in a better mood. And do more than that, really
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.560]   give oxygen to our lungs and keep us going and not quitting.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.720]   And is it somewhat self-fulfilling? If it feels hard to start practicing this
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.520]   more and more regularly, is it something that as you do it, and you see the
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.880]   reaction becomes easier?
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.360]   I don't think it's hard. That's the thing. It's really not hard. List the
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.720]   15 times in the recent history that you were in a environment with somebody,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.920]   maybe you were interviewing them on your podcast, and they said something in
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.960]   error. And you could have corrected them, whether it's their grammar or fact,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.800]   you know, they were just factually in error because they were talking very
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.480]   fast. And instead of correcting them, you just let them talk. And eventually
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.080]   over the process of listening, they actually were able to spit out the
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.760]   sentence in a way that you could edit around it without having to super
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.560]   critique them in that moment. That's an act of kindness. I don't think it's
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.080]   hard. I just think it's a choice. I work in a live studio environment. And so
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.320]   there are times when you want it to be a little quieter on the set. But as the
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.680]   host of the show, that's not my job to make it quieter on the set. It's the
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.600]   stage director's job to make it quieter on the set. So my kindness is keeping
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.400]   myself in my lane, and trusting that other person to do their job instead of
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.960]   thinking cut, I wish somebody would do their job. That's a kindness, deciding
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.880]   to trust somebody. So I think it's really more of you know what, I'm going
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.400]   to stay calm in this moment. And right now, that's at a premium. There are a
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   lot of people who blow up there are a lot of people, I just looked up the
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.800]   word stability. One of my favorite definitions from Merriam Webster's
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.600]   dictionary is not radioactive, not spontaneously radioactive, like, a lot
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.640]   of people can blow up easily, whether it's rush hour traffic, or it's at
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.960]   their kids or their spouse or partner. And it's like, everybody's kind of
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.240]   asking for a chill pill right now, like, can you please just keep it chill. And
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.480]   we want that for ourselves. So if we can put ourselves in somebody else's
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.240]   shoes and use that empathy that we use that word so often now, but it really is
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.000]   about putting ourselves in the position of somebody else, we can think, you
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.200]   know what, I can keep my mouth shut for five minutes, I can wait until this
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.520]   next commercial break to express myself. And then just in terms of everyday
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.800]   life, going to the grocery store, going to pick up your kids from school, like,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.160]   there's always going to be some interruption. Can you just hold on for
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.480]   five minutes? Can you just hold on for one hour? Can you just hold on until you
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.920]   get off at 5pm? Yes, most of us can. And that's the kindness, it's the choice to
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   hold on. Just take it day by day, take it hour by hour, take it every 15 minutes,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.600]   if you have to. That choice is something once we put it in bite sized pieces
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   becomes very easy.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.440]   I think we all want to do this. I have a few times in my history where I'm sure
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.480]   I've been on the giving side of an annoying kind of blow up in an argument.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   And after the fact, I'm like, gosh, I wish I just paused and took a break. But
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.560]   in the moment, it's much harder. Is there a practice or something to think about
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.200]   that makes it top of mind for you?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.520]   I don't have my other cell phone near me. But it says hot mic on it. And this is
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.800]   my easy way to do this. Imagine that the person or persons next to you all have
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.360]   their cell phone out and they're going to roll on you in the next few minutes.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.120]   And so your reaction is potentially going to go viral. Now, I'm not trying to
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.360]   use a scare tactic, but it's that thought of, there's going to be video
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:40.400]   proof of how I behave. Now, I have to live with that reality every single day.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.000]   But if we all acted like we were on national television, that to me is just
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.760]   enough of a trigger for me to think, wait, just wait a second. Would I want
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.280]   this on video? And would I want this on TikTok all around the world? No, not so
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.120]   much. So let me just chill. That helps me. I hope that helps somebody else out
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.520]   there.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.840]   No, I think the kind of subtle reminders, whether they're post-its you put on
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.280]   your computer screen, or whether they're changing your background on your phone,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.560]   those little tricks, I think sometimes help people. And what I meant earlier
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.000]   was once you start doing it more regularly, maybe it actually becomes
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.840]   easier. I think Nir Eyal, who wrote a book called Indistractable, says, "Hey,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.680]   whenever you're feeling that urge to go pick up your phone and check Instagram
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   or Twitter or TikTok, pause for a second and just feel what it feels like to want
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.440]   to go do that. And maybe at the beginning, you just still go do it. But
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.240]   the more you understand, "Oh, that's the internal feeling of I'm having this
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.840]   desire to do something that I know is bad for me, that I know I don't want to
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.040]   do." Step one is feel what it feels like so you can work on recognizing it.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.680]   Yeah, I think we do need to get more in touch with the feeling, whether it's
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.160]   positive or negative. It's just like, "Okay, what am I processing right now?
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.720]   What's going on in my head that's making me want to either blow up or run away?"
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.400]   Because a lot of us have a fight or flight tendency in our DNA. And it's
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.840]   like, rather than have conflict, even if we don't mind a conflict, we would
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.360]   rather just walk out. And we can't always do that. So having a word that
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.680]   calms you down, having a song that you sing. And I think if you can come up
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.480]   with some little mini mantras, so that when things do get tense, innocuous
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.760]   mantras. There was a gentleman that I worked with, and I got a little bit
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.080]   heated with at one point. And I said, "Listen," I said, "I apologize, because
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.720]   I could have come off a lot kinder there." I said, "If you ever notice me
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.240]   getting that way, and maybe you think I haven't noticed, I want you to signal
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.960]   me. And this is how you're going to signal me. I want you to say
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.160]   jalapeno." And I said, "Jalapeno is the code word between you and me that
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.040]   things are getting a little too hot in here, and we need to turn it down a
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.360]   notch." And he laughed out loud. I mean, it was just like a fun, innocuous way
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.720]   to remind ourselves not to get too irritated, or not to get too spicy with
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.240]   one another. So it worked.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.880]   I just did a run, Robin Arzon from Peloton, and they have these outdoor
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.360]   runs. And she has a similar thing where she's like, "Pick a word when you're
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.040]   running, and anytime it's hard, just repeat the word." And for her, it was
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.760]   "Outlast." I'm not training for a marathon or anything, but I am trying
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.440]   to beat records every time I run. And that idea of having a word, whether you
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.400]   repeat it to someone or to yourself, I found personally to be really helpful. I
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.160]   probably stole her word. I probably should come up with my own. But "Outlast"
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.080]   seemed like a good word to remind yourself when trying to complete a
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.120]   physical challenge.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   Yeah, well, and really, like deciding to be kind in a world that can be very
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   unkind is as physical as it gets. You will have a visceral response sometimes
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.440]   to pressure and stress. And being kind is the last thing you want to do. You
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.840]   either want to tell somebody what you really think, or you want to get the
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.040]   heck out. I didn't write the book to have some utopian idea of, "Oh, let's
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.480]   just all just be really sweet to each other." I wrote it because I wanted
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.160]   people to start seeing themselves as kind as an identity, not as an act.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.600]   Because whatever you believe you are is what you'll attract. But also,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.040]   whatever you believe you are, you will stay true to. Even if you mess up, even
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.800]   if you stumble, you're going to return back to that baseline of who you see
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.320]   yourself as. So if you see yourself as kind, not just somebody who can be kind,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.520]   but your full identity as a person is kind, then you can come back to
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.760]   center. That will be your North Star. If you think, "I'm kind when I'm in a
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.960]   good mood," or "I'm kind after I have coffee," then you are limiting
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:37.000]   yourself and stressful situations may put you over the edge and you may not
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.280]   even realize how little control you have over your emotions in those times.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.480]   Sometimes the things that you might say don't necessarily come off as kind. And
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.000]   I'll give a fun example, which was I interviewed a guy named Mike Hayes, who
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.960]   was a former Navy SEAL commander. And he was giving a lecture and a student
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   asked a question that was one of those questions that was kind of annoying.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.200]   Trying to tell the whole room how great they are before they asked the
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.640]   question. And his response was, "Hey, I'm going to pause you and tell you
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.120]   you're a bad question asker. And in the moment, you're probably feeling really
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.400]   small. But otherwise, I'm going to let you go on through life asking
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.480]   questions terribly and have all these people..." So he meant it in the nicest
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.000]   way. But it certainly is sometimes hard for those things to come across kind.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.480]   How do you balance that?
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.960]   I think that a lot of times kindness does get this wrap of, "Oh, it has to be
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.000]   said in the most sugary, sweet way. Otherwise, it's not kind." When the
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.520]   truth of the matter is, sometimes tough love really is truly love. Sometimes
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.800]   being kind looks like criticism, but it's the best thing you could do. It
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.680]   will save your life, your career over the course of your relationships.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.760]   Because that'll be the reality check. I can't tell you how many times when
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.960]   somebody gets got, not got in my face, like in a confrontational way, because
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.240]   there's a difference between confronting and offering constructive feedback, but
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.760]   just told me like, "Listen, A, I got to tell you the truth because I don't know
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.160]   that anybody else will." And it was just a lifesaver of information. But there
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.880]   aren't a lot of people who are that honest. And if they don't love you or
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.240]   care about you, if they don't have that desire to make you better, then
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.680]   they'll just let you keep doing what you're doing. But if they are kind
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.840]   enough to be super upfront with you and to tell you something that will
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.480]   actually help you be better and be who you really want to be, then that's
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.120]   absolutely kind, even if the delivery stings a little bit.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.640]   There's a book that I read when I was running a company called Radical
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.800]   Candor. And it highlights that if you don't build the relationship for
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.960]   someone to know that that feedback comes from a good place, then even if
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.320]   your intentions are good, it's probably not going to land on the delivery. So
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.240]   you have to spend time cultivating the relationship for someone to say, "Oh,
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.200]   they're probably trying to help me improve when they tell me that the work
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.560]   I just delivered was terrible."
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.560]   And I think that too, there's two kinds of people in this world. For the
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.880]   majority of people that you are going to have to nurture that relationship
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.120]   before you can be that honest with them. But there is a small, I would say a
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.520]   radically small group of people who can handle that kind of honesty and
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.200]   frankness, like you're talking about, no matter how it's delivered, because
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.600]   they're so hungry. Like the hungriest hunters, the people who are so
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.080]   teachable, the ones who are willing to pay the highest price, and there's more
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.160]   than one person on the planet who thinks like that, they will take it
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.960]   however they can get it because their ultimate goals are higher than their
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.240]   feelings. And they're not going to let sensitivity stop them from growing.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   Does it sometimes hurt still? Absolutely. But the top 1% of people had
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.200]   to put their feelings aside, in order to grow through those painful
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.360]   experiences that looked like an insult, but really was the billion dollar idea
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.280]   to their success.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.000]   I don't know if I'm necessarily want to put myself into that when you called it
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.320]   the top percent. But I do love feedback. And I find that people in general don't
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.280]   like giving it because they are kind and they want people to feel good. But
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.880]   for me, it most comes around when I'm cooking, and I'll make something for
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.520]   dinner, and I serve it to everyone. They're like, "This was so good." I'm
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   like, "Great, thank you. I appreciate that you enjoy it. But what could I do
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.960]   so that when I make this dish next time, it's even better?" And I find it so
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.720]   difficult to pull out the criticism from people. So if we reverse this, any
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.400]   tips for someone trying to seek criticism in a world where sometimes
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.520]   people don't like giving it?
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.160]   Well, I think number one is I would use a more real life situation than your
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.400]   cooking. Because I think cooking, as much as you probably love the idea of
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.160]   just cooking, I want to ask you, have you ever been in a situation where you
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.000]   knew that this person was wiser than you, more experienced than you, wealthier
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.760]   than you, and you knew that you could learn and glean from them, but you
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.720]   didn't know what to ask to get them to be really upfront? Have you ever been in
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   that situation?
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.240]   I'm sure I have. An example doesn't come to mind. But sometimes I've
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:05.160]   interviewed people who have their own successful podcasts or TV shows with the
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.920]   goal at the end. And I was... I planned to do this with you. But we're a little
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.680]   bit of the ways in. And ask for feedback on my ability to interview, on my
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.520]   running an interview. I haven't gotten a lot of feedback. People are kind of
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.680]   like, "Oh, you did a great job. Good job." And I'm like, "No, thank you. But I
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.840]   know that you've done this more than me. I know there's something I can learn
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.040]   from you." And I find it difficult to pull that out sometimes.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.200]   I think that number one thing I would do is I'd take myself out of it. And I'd
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.160]   say, "What would you tell..." And then I would give a category. Young
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.280]   entrepreneurs, or whatever definition of the category of people that you place
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.040]   yourself in. And say, "What would you tell your 20-something or 30-something
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:53.720]   self?" Start there. And then the next question is, "I'm giving you permission
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.000]   to be really direct with me. What would you say that I should take away from
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.200]   this conversation?" And see what they say. Now, again, a lot of the smartest
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.840]   people in the room can be very blunt, but they might want to know that they
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.680]   nurtured a relationship. They don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. They've
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   learned, like you said, a long time ago, that it doesn't pay to make somebody
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:22.200]   feel lousy right after they just met you. First impression, right? But when
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.120]   they are able to make a broader stroke, and it's not so personal, like, "What
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.840]   can you do?" Then it actually lands better because you can apply it not
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.920]   only for your life, but you can talk to anybody in your peer group and give
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.040]   them the same piece of wisdom. I just learned that a lot of people don't
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.680]   really want the truth. You can't handle the truth. And I want to be kind to
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.600]   you. I want to help you. But it requires that you almost kind of have it coming
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.760]   out of your eyeballs and your pores, that I am so hungry to learn and be a
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.280]   student of this moment and be a student of life and be a student of those who
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.520]   are more advanced than me, that I can hear anything. And you can say that to
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.080]   your blue in the face, but unless you're really admitting it, unless you're
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.280]   really like sending it out into the universe, they can smell that. It's like
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.440]   they can smell fear.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.200]   Well, I can promise you that I am in that camp. So before we wrap this
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.040]   conversation, be thinking about anything I could be doing because you
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   have 10 times the experience or maybe 100 than I do. But before I ask you
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.720]   that, I want to know, can people ever be too kind? Can there be a
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.000]   circumstance where there's just too much kindness in a room in a
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.840]   conversation?
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.440]   No, because kindness and niceness are different. I think you can be too nice.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.920]   I think you can be again, afraid to hurt somebody's feelings, afraid to
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.240]   make a bad impression. Fearful of anything will cause you to compromise
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.800]   your standards and compromise who you really are. But I think that being
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.720]   kind means kind of being self aware. And at the same time being very, very
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.240]   aware of other people and knowing what maybe they could handle what the room
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.560]   could bear. Again, reading the room is so key. In speaking to a group
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.840]   recently, there were two big meetings. And I could have given the same
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.680]   speech twice, nobody would have complained. The first speech was great.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.800]   I could have just hit replay on my memory and busted out this
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.280]   extemporaneous speech, and probably had a better delivery because I've
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.520]   already done it once before in front of a live audience, right. But there
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.000]   was the gentleman who was kind of escorting me through my different
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.640]   stuff. And he said, Wow, he was like, you didn't give a cookie cutter
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.880]   message. I said, different room, different need. I was like, you have
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.760]   to know what the room will bear. There's one way to read the room by
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.480]   actually going around and kind of surveying people like before the event
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.520]   starts and shaking hands and kind of networking and breezing through and
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.280]   kind of getting a little focus group going of the experiences of the
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.920]   different people that you've met, you can make a judgment based on the age
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.720]   of the average attendee. But eventually you get practiced in
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.600]   discerning what it is that a room actually is looking for. Why am I
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.320]   really there? Some of that is research and development. But
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.760]   otherwise, that's actually time and experience and tenure of going and
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.000]   speaking to crowds and learning about people and human engagement, and
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.360]   just being fully present. And that comes through kindness, because when
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.440]   I'm kind, I'm so aware of the other people around me, that I almost have
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.200]   what I call in the book, a sixth sense, an intuition that helps me to
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.840]   understand people better.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.760]   Is there an example of a time where you read the room and it altered what
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.080]   you were going to say or how you're going to say it that you could share?
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.280]   Yeah, I gave a speech and I thought I was going to talk about just kindness
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.600]   as your superpower, you know, let me just give the delivery of my book,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.640]   and I'll give a couple examples, and I'll have fun. But I just got really
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.160]   quiet. And when you're quiet to me, and you hear this from all the top
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.320]   minds and thought leaders in the world is that that quiet time can be so
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.960]   creative and able to tap you in to the space that you need to be in. But I
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.800]   ended up getting a word, just one single word of what this group needed.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.320]   And I went into the room, and I'm listening to the beginning parts of the
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.720]   awards program. And at one point, they're honoring somebody who died.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.440]   And at one point, they're honoring somebody who was in the ICU. And
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.200]   there's tears and they're crying on the stage right before I'm about to
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.920]   give my big speech. And I was like, I'm so glad I got quiet. Because the
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   word that I gotten and the situation that I was in, caused me to connect
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.200]   the dots in a different way when I delivered that speech, because you can
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.080]   go into a room and you can be really fun and engaging and exciting. But
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.960]   they were all very emotional, and a bit raw. And so they needed
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.720]   encouragement, but they didn't need it in a rah rah sis boom bah kind of
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.920]   way. And so reading the room for me meant being quiet enough to kind of
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.160]   tap in where I was paying attention. But because I was calm and myself,
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.840]   again, everybody's asking us to just take a big chill pill. But if I'm
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.000]   super high on like my wavelength of I got to deliver a really good speech,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.400]   I'm not going to be cool and chill and calm enough in myself to be actually
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.320]   paying attention to the room when they're crying on stage. I'm going to
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.880]   go practice my speech, go over my notes, order another drink, if I do
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.240]   that before I speak, just being present enough to listen to the program
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.560]   versus thinking, I'm too busy to listen to the program. I'm good. I
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.360]   know how to jump on a stage and give a talk. That would have been a big
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.080]   mistake on my part. But because I listened to them, because I've been
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.480]   quiet in my own private time, I could now tailor my delivery in a way that
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.120]   landed and people came up to me afterwards thanking me for what I
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.360]   shared, because it hit home for them. But I was in tune with the room and I
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.280]   was listening to the room.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.120]   Obviously, reading the room is the the big hack in that conversation. But two
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.640]   other things I took away, which I'm curious to hear your reaction. So one,
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.760]   be prepared. So I want to talk in a second about the kinds of preparation
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.880]   you do before delivering a keynote presentation. But for many people, it
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.640]   might just be a presentation at work or an important conversation with
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.920]   friends or family. And the other, which I'm interpreting as a hack might be,
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.840]   if you're giving a presentation in a work meeting, volunteer to not go
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.880]   first, so that you have a chance to read the room, how they might react to
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.760]   another presentation, so you can kind of tailor that delivery.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.520]   Well, I mean, I was the only speaker, I was the keynote. So it was me.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.840]   You didn't have a choice.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.440]   I didn't have a choice. And when I spoke, but I think that one key would
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.600]   be when I arrive at a destination, one way to prepare is to go early. And
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.560]   reading the room can be reading the tense moments that happen while
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.600]   they're putting the dishes on the table or while they're setting up the
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.680]   PowerPoint slide. You can capture a little bit of reading the room by
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.880]   seeing how stressed out or calm or fun the staff is prior to the audience
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.160]   even arriving. Because I think all of that plays into it. One of my
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.600]   favorite interviews of all time was Lady Gaga, Sam Elliott. Why can't I
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.640]   think of the name other names? The Star is Born cast, Anthony...
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.400]   Bradley Cooper.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.760]   Bradley Cooper. I was like, of course, Bradley Cooper. How do I forget
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.680]   Bradley Cooper? But I was setting up for that Star is Born interview.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.080]   And I remember getting in the room very early. And the first person to
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.120]   enter the room and the second person and how they entered the room was
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.960]   very significant, because they didn't all come together. But just being
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.040]   present and knowing what my crew is going through and knowing what the
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.360]   publicity team was feeling like, because there was a little bit of
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.000]   tension, because it's always tense, because they're like dealing with
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.840]   these people who have to go through all these different interviews in
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.920]   succession. But I remember sitting in the room and thinking our chairs
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.000]   were too far apart. I asked the crew, I said, can you move the chairs a
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.400]   little closer? Well, we did. Then after the whole thing was done,
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.400]   everybody loved the interview, big success. One person who wasn't even on
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.360]   that team, contacted me and said, I want to give you some feedback. I
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.240]   think the chairs should have been closer. So I was reading the room
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.000]   correctly, in terms of preparing, that's something that anybody, whether
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.760]   you're giving a keynote, or you're doing something at work, you want to
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   think about the furniture, you want to think about how close you're going to
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.000]   be to the table, if it's in a conference room area, are you going to
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.520]   move around the room? Are you gonna have somebody else operate your
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.840]   presentation in the clicker? Or are you going to do that yourself? All of
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   those things lead to you feeling more prepared with the choreography of the
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.560]   conversation. And it takes a lot of stress off of you. It's not controlling
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.360]   the whole situation. You want to read the room, but you also want to have
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.160]   some sense of preparing it yourself and creating atmosphere in the room.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.480]   Because that'll help you actually channel the right vibes when people do
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.920]   sit down to hear you speak.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.840]   One counterintuitive thing that I've done is that I like to really prepare
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.680]   if I'm giving a talk, right? To the point that I know exactly what I want
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.880]   to say on every slide and all that. And some people say, "Well, but then
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.840]   isn't scripted?" And I say, "No." Actually, going through knowing exactly
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.320]   what I would say in a perfect scenario makes it really easy for me to diverge
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.640]   in the moment to do anything. So it's less memorizing a script and repeating
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.520]   the script as much as like memorizing every point I want to get across. So
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.400]   I'm free to move around. How do you think about preparing for a big
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.480]   meeting or a conversation or a talk for you?
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.040]   I really flow a lot. Think about it. I was in high school and I started doing
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.600]   speech contests. And my coach would literally untie my tennis shoes while I
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.400]   was talking, while he was timing me to be as close to 10 minutes as possible,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.120]   throw toilet paper across, maybe even throw toilet paper rolls at me. It was
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.960]   all very gentle, nothing abusive, but it was all to distract me while I was
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.680]   giving this talk and sounding pitch perfect while getting as close to 10
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:04.120]   minutes as possible. So over the years, I've gone from memorizing my entire
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.200]   script verbatim, which I can still do to this day. I've done it with breaking
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.240]   news. When I worked for ABC, you know, somebody gives me a story and I have to
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.960]   go live in four minutes and I can literally memorize the entire 40 second
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:24.720]   script or minute 30 script that I'm going to do. But now extemporaneously, I
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.560]   can memorize if I type it out and literally write out the speech, I can
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.200]   pretty much gather in my head what the main points are. It won't come off
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.840]   exactly verbatim, but it's so close to what I put on paper. You have to know
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.080]   your strengths. Not everybody can memorize like that. Not everybody will
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.800]   work well if they're just flowing between bullet points written on cue
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.520]   cards. So if what you're doing works for you, keep doing it. But if you want to
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.360]   step it up to another level, maybe try a different delivery style, record
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.920]   yourself on video at home where you don't have to worry about the pressure
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.480]   of actually doing it in real life and see how it comes off. And then have a
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.040]   mentor or somebody who's a more experienced speaker than you take a look
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.800]   at it and say, Hey, I wanted you to give me your honest feedback about my
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.400]   delivery. I don't think there's a wrong or right way to do it. I just think that
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.360]   when you've been speaking for 20 years, you're going to come off differently
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.320]   than if you've been speaking for five, even if you're an excellent speaker. If
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.520]   you try a different method, the different methods actually will show you
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.320]   your strengths.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.280]   That makes sense. What about you? I mean, you gave, Oh, I just kicked a trash
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:37.520]   can.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.200]   Just trying to throw you off your game.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.920]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day. But the
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.560]   reality is that I am definitely not. So I love having an easy way to get my
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.680]   daily nutritional insurance, which is why I kickstart my day with athletic
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.960]   greens. And I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.800]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. And
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.280]   I've kept it in my daily routine for months. Every morning, I mix it up with
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.680]   some cold water, add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold. And I
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.240]   head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which is a
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.400]   feeling I absolutely love. I also love that it's made from 75 high quality
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.440]   vitamins, minerals and superfoods and contains less than one gram of sugar. It
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.280]   also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals or artificial anything to make giving it a
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.880]   try. Easy athletic greens is going to give you a free one year supply of
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.040]   immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:45.000]   purchase. All you have to do is visit all the hacks.com/athletic greens.

[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.920]   health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance. Being a parent
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.120]   can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler jump on your new couch naked
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.400]   during potty training, or the indescribable pain of stepping on tiny
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.160]   plastic dinosaurs in your bare feet, both of which happened to me recently.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.520]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.200]   especially when you do it with Fabric, who I'm excited to partner with for

[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.200]   For the last few years, I know a lot of us have been working remotely. I know
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.160]   that's changing, but for some people, that's probably the new normal. And I'm
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.120]   curious what kinds of lessons you've either applied or people could take away
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.720]   for how to work on their delivery of important conversations, work on their
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.520]   interaction with teammates, colleagues, when they're looking at a computer
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.280]   screen and not able to walk around the room or maybe not read the room as
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   easily as you would be able to in person.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.480]   Treat your Zoom calls like FaceTime. You know, we have way more fun on
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.200]   Instagram Live and FaceTime sometimes. As soon as we get in Zoom mode or
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.640]   whatever platform your office uses, it's like, "Let me stay in this very
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.600]   tight little box and not move and have very little body language." And it's
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:06.400]   like, "No, lean into the screen. Get in there. Don't be afraid of you looking
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.960]   distorted or looking silly. Move your body around. Don't just be a head and
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:15.360]   shoulders." People don't even like seeing that on television anymore. They
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.120]   want to see you kind of jump it through the screen and just be personable. And
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.360]   like, selfie mode your Zoom meeting. Not the whole time, but like, use the
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   different tools that we have at our disposal. If it's your laptop, be like,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.760]   "Hey, guys, I'm just getting back to my desk." And you know, make it a funny
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:39.040]   moment. Like, loosen up. And I think that people will stay more engaged
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.800]   because I frankly think it gets really stale when we're all just looking like
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.040]   we're in our perfect little box. That's my first big tip and one that I hope
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.200]   lasts and sticks with you.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.760]   I remember early in the pandemic, for no particular reason, I bought a bunch of
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.560]   like party glasses on Amazon, just so that whenever we started a meeting, it
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.640]   was like, "Could we break the ice in a different way?" And so that was one
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.600]   thing I tried to do. I bought like those mullet wigs at one point. I feel like
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.280]   some of that phased away and I'm like, "Maybe I need to go dust off that box in
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.200]   the storage room and bring it back out."
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.160]   The fact is, is that the digital world is not going away. Like the virtual
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.240]   meeting world is not going away. So how can we surprise people? Whether it's
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:27.000]   party glasses or you inbox the first five people to log on on time, because
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.200]   there's always inevitably the people who are late to these things and say, "Hey,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.920]   guess what?" You know, and then five minutes in, "We just wanted to let you
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.760]   know the first five people who got here got Starbucks gift cards and everybody
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.960]   else, we hope you'll be on time next time." I mean, don't make them feel bad,
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.360]   but just like, guess what? There's a reward. Have themes. We just had the
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.840]   Kentucky Derby. Have a Derby hat Zoom call for your meeting. You don't have to
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.720]   keep the hat on the whole time. And then the fact is so many people stay on the
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.280]   photo, like they don't even go to the video anymore. I don't know if that's
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   like a rule that you have to, but like we hide behind the photos a lot. And so
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.400]   it's like, how can I get people to not have the static image, but to actually
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.880]   let us into their home? If they're hiding behind the photo, chances are
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.480]   they're either really busy, their house is a mess, or they're stressed out and
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.680]   they just don't want to see anybody and they don't want anybody to see them. And
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.480]   so for me, it's like giving people fair warning, "Listen, no static images,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:29.280]   we're going to do video. And we're going to give a reward to the person with the
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.160]   best background." And then they can do their virtual fake background thing so
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.240]   that they don't feel the pressure that they have to have the most perfect house
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.080]   behind them. Like, "Oh my God, this is a contest of who has the best living room."
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.240]   No. Or the best kitchen. No. I think that there is a lot of social anxiety right
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   now overlooking like everything's okay when it's not. And I think that if you're
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.680]   hiding, it's because you need somebody to call you and be kind to you and say,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.560]   "Hey, how you doing? Are you okay?"
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.760]   Which probably isn't the best thing to do in a group setting. But if you notice
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.680]   someone's kind of stepping away, maybe there's a really good opportunity after
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.800]   the meeting to reach out to that person. "Hey, noticed your background was off.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.920]   How are you doing? Is everything cool?" Those kind of subtle moments I found can
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.840]   add a lot of value in relationship building and in many other places.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.680]   I think mental health should be in the spotlight all the time, especially after
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.160]   the past couple of years. You know, there's a lot of people who are doing
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.760]   great and their businesses are doing wonderful and there's so much
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.280]   opportunity. But I think there's a lot of people who have struggled with the past
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.560]   couple of years and so struggled to find connection in a tribe. I think people are
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.160]   just longing for interpersonal communication and in a way that's real
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.920]   and like meeting kind people. And it's like, how can we help them? Well, first
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.720]   of all, if you're at work and you notice somebody's never showing their video, to
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.400]   me, that's a big fat red flag that they might long for some connection that they
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.120]   just don't have. And they're isolating because they feel alone. And they've
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.760]   disconnected from their family over the time, maybe because somebody's in a health
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.880]   battle and they can't go visit them because they are high risk. It's like, we
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.520]   need to pay more attention. And there's ways to do that, of course, privately and
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.080]   then publicly just kind of encourage people to check in on each other. So just
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.040]   make those appeals.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.440]   And if you're the manager, I would say, if you're finding it hard to make every
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.240]   meeting exciting on video, maybe decide if there's some meetings that don't need
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.080]   to be. I find that we've gone overboard. Like things that would have been phone
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.840]   calls three years ago are now all video meetings. I schedule some phone calls a
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.760]   lot and then save video for a time where the face to face is more important
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.880]   because I don't know about you, you're on camera all day. But sometimes I'm
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.560]   exhausted just looking at a screen for hours on end.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:48.360]   Yes, I'm with you. I'm on video calls almost as long as I'm on TV every day.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.760]   And you're just like, well, sometimes, frankly, I just want to wear this
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.440]   wrinkled t shirt and have my hair in a bun and not care. But it wouldn't be the
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.200]   most professional expression of my highest and best self. All the lines are
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.640]   so blurred. It's like, give each other a break. Just understand, like you said,
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.520]   not every call deserves a video conference. Yes.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.240]   I do think face to face is really helpful in building deeper
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.400]   relationships, building trust. There was a whole chapter in the book about
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.160]   building trust in seconds, which it kind of reminded me of like the Dale
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.640]   Carnegie, how to win friends and influence people without the undertone
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.320]   of trying to influence other people to do something. But I'm curious how you
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.360]   would explain to someone hearing that and say, "Okay, wait, I can build trust.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.560]   I can be kind. What's the trick? How do I start doing that?"
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.800]   The key is to become practiced, right? How often do you go out, whether it's
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.720]   Target, or the dry cleaner, or to pick up some food, and you don't speak to a
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.000]   single soul? It's foreign to me that people go out and they never
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   acknowledge, smile, make eye contact, strike up conversation with anybody.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.040]   They just walk, get their stuff, walk back. In a world where we're craving
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   connection, we can be apprehensive about interpersonal communications with
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.760]   strangers, which is interesting. But that's how you meet new people. So the
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.400]   first thing is just start to become more open. Really easy example, I was at the
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.720]   airline lounge, or one of my recent trips, and this woman walks in and says,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.560]   "I love your shoes. Those are so cute." And I said, "Oh, thank you so much." And
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.200]   I told her where I got them. I told her a little story about them. "Oh, what's
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.240]   your name? Where are you traveling to?" "Oh, I'm going to Florida." I mean, you
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.720]   get all this information. We didn't exchange business cards. But in that
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:43.320]   moment, she felt comfortable just having a conversation with me. Another
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.400]   situation I had, I was out at a restaurant, I happened to go by myself,
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.960]   I was getting some food, and the couple next to me strikes up a conversation.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.160]   But I do that all over the place. So I'm not surprised when people want to
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.440]   strike up conversations with me out of nowhere, because I literally do it all
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.560]   the time. And so it's like, once you're practiced in doing that, then
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.480]   somebody is going to strike up a conversation with you where they're
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.360]   going to build more on what they're going through. Or they're going to ask
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.600]   you for something in their realm of business. And they're going to feel like
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.720]   they can trust you because you are actually showing genuine interest. The
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.560]   thing is, you do not have genuine interest when you're born. You have to
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.160]   actually experiment with genuine interest as you become a grown up and
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.800]   then as you are a grown up. And so as I'm curious about other people, I
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:38.040]   actually build trust with them. People can smell when you're not authentic.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.520]   People can smell when you're just trying to network and get a business
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.920]   card. "Oh, do you have a card? Oh, yeah. Oh, you're in television. Oh,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.400]   yeah. I know somebody you should interview." That's fine. But the fact
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.200]   of the matter is, is that when you actually show that you care about
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.120]   somebody, then they feel safer with you. "Thank you for that genuine concern
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.720]   that you have about my loved one." Because you end up talking about that
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.640]   kind of stuff on planes and in restaurants and in airline lounges with
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.880]   perfect strangers, because now you're practiced in showing that genuine
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.000]   interest with people.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.880]   Now, I'm sure you've been in a situation where maybe you didn't have that
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.760]   genuine interest. So how does that play out? Because I've definitely been in
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.040]   conversations and sometimes I'm too blunt, which I think can maybe be off
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.920]   putting, but I'm like, "You know what, I feel like breaking off a
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.800]   conversation when there's no genuine interest to me is better than just
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.920]   sitting there and faking it." But neither path forward seems like it's
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.680]   the kindest path forward. So what do you do in that circumstance?
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.280]   A lot of my building trust with strangers happens on planes, or it can
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.240]   happen on social media. And there was 2 times on planes once years ago and
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.640]   once most recently that I was so exhausted. I had 2 hours of sleep where
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.400]   I was looking at getting 2 hours of sleep before I had to be at work the
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.680]   next morning. And in the first instance, I was exhausted. I did not want to be
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.400]   there. I had to put a blanket over my head and I wanted to just knock out and
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:09.280]   the person next to me had their food on the island in between the 2 of us and
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:16.200]   on the floor and was eating kind of loud. And I'm like, "No." And then I
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.560]   thought, "Gosh, I feel like I'm supposed to strike up a conversation with this
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.960]   person and I don't want to, I'm tired." And it ended up that I thought, "Well,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.920]   why am I on this plane sitting next to this person? This is a captive audience
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:36.000]   for 45 minutes." You know, it's a short flight I was on. I can allow myself to
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.160]   give into my sleepiness, my fatigue, or I can be selfless in this moment and be
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.240]   kind and see if there's any reason why. There's a once in a lifetime
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.120]   opportunity for me to know this person. I can hang on for 45 minutes. I can stay
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.600]   awake for that long. Ended up exchanging phone numbers. They ended up helping me
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:59.640]   later on in life. It was just amazing. If I would have missed that opportunity, I
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:05.040]   never would know. And it kind of marked my life because it's those times when
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.760]   you want to quit. It's those times when you want to just, "Please, I don't want
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.520]   to hear anybody. I'm going to put my headphones on and I'm going to block out
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.120]   the world." That's the time when you want to pay more attention, take your
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.560]   headphones off. Because inevitably, practice kindness leads to more kindness
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.960]   and more open doors. Practice selfishness, practice blocking out the world, practice
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.880]   isolation. I know that doesn't sound like... It's like, "Give me a break,
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.360]   Adrienne. You're telling me you never..." Yes, I do. But I don't know what I missed
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.880]   out on in that selfish moment. I don't know what I missed out on when I said,
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.560]   "You know what? I don't care. It's just me and I'm going to go to sleep. Leave
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.480]   me alone." I've stopped saying the words, "Leave me alone," especially in light of
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.040]   the past couple of years. Because I think that there are a lot of people who wish
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.360]   that those words were never uttered out of their mouth. I never want to be alone
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.880]   again in terms of not being connected to other people. So yes, I think there's a
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:03.160]   fine line. Yes, I think that we all have our moments. But I really try to spur
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.960]   myself on just like somebody who's running in a race and they're tired and
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   they don't want to finish that race. Every time I sit on that plane and I'm
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.880]   sleepy, I think, "No, force yourself. Think about 'Am I supposed to know this
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.920]   person?'" And if you have peace that says, "No, absolutely not." Like if your
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.480]   peace is like, "No, I'm good. Take a nap." Then take a nap by all means. But I
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.400]   really don't like to miss opportunities. And I just think you're there for a
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.640]   reason, for a person.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.720]   I'm with you on the not wanting to miss opportunities. But I'll push you on what
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.040]   happens if you've got this 45-minute flight, you're 5-10 minutes into this
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.960]   conversation, and you're like, "There's not an opportunity."
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.880]   I've done that. And here's what I'll say happens. I'll entertain the
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:51.720]   conversation, and kindly. And I'll show genuine interest. It's true. And then if
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.400]   I feel like this is not one of those opportunities, this is the time to just
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.200]   be friendly. I'll touch their arm gently to reassure them this is not
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.320]   personal. And I'll say, "You know what? I have not had any sleep." And I mean it
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.080]   because most times I haven't. I'll say, "I've got to take a little bit of a nap.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.760]   I apologize." And if they want to share their information with me, that's
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.120]   totally fine. But I literally like sleep is such a premium, and conversation is
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.560]   such a premium. You don't have to feel bad. You can receive their information.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.120]   Maybe you'll need it down the road. But it's okay to say, "Can I get your card?"
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.520]   And then say, "It was really nice to talk to you." I've had times when I wasn't
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:32.000]   sleepy, and I'm reading a book. And they want to have a long conversation while
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.040]   I'm sitting there reading my book. And I'll say, "You know what? It was really
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.600]   nice talking with you." It's more than small talk to me though. It's exploration.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.360]   It's like, "Let me learn a little bit more about you." In my head, this isn't an
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.320]   opportunity that's gonna come to fruition in the way that I thought maybe
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.920]   it could. But I enjoy talking with you. I'm gonna finish reading my book now, but
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.240]   it was really nice talking to you. There's nothing wrong with that. Don't
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:56.080]   fake the funk. Not every single person that you sit next to is gonna be a gold
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.560]   mine. I'm sorry to keep probing, but this is like a place where I feel like
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:07.200]   kindness is either hard or in your mind, you don't love it, but you're able to do
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.800]   it. It's a room where there's maybe 50 people and you're at a conference. Maybe
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.080]   you're the one keynoting and you're stuck in a conversation. A lot of the
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.120]   typical excuses of "I need to go take a nap" or "I need to go eat" don't totally
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.280]   apply because the answer is really like, "We had a brief conversation and I want
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.680]   to go have a bunch of brief conversations." Oftentimes, I try to be
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   honest and say, "Hey, I've really enjoyed talking to you. There's a lot of people
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.760]   here. I want to make sure I get a chance to meet them. I'm gonna go around."
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.040]   Sometimes I feel like people might take that as rude because we've only been
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.720]   talking five minutes and maybe they were still interested. Anything you would do
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.920]   in that circumstance differently?
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.800]   For me, it's funny. There's an art to living and there's an art to
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.680]   conversations that are brief like that at those events. Again, this is something
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.920]   where you have to practice. Practice makes perfect. I think that the biggest
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.120]   issue is that a lot of people in this generation are afraid to offend people.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:04.840]   I think that that fear leads to us being more obliged to be what we think is
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:11.640]   nice, kind, respectful. It's too much fear. I think that getting rid of the fear is
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:16.480]   the key. It's not so much how do you do it, it's what do you eliminate in
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.080]   yourself so that you're more confident flowing from one conversation to the
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.920]   next. When you're with a group of your friends, don't you guys talk over
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:30.200]   each other all the time? Yes. Does anybody get offended? No. You step on each other
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.240]   all the time. You're like, "No, no, no. Let me tell you. Oh, but da, da, da, da, da," and then
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.960]   somebody else don't. But nobody's feelings are getting hurt because you feel safe in
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.920]   that environment that you cut each other off all the time, but nobody's thinking,
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.760]   "I can't believe I didn't finish my thought." Nobody's thinking that because
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:53.160]   that's a normal organic conversation. So when you go into an event, I would want
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:58.320]   anybody to walk in and say, almost give themselves a pep talk, "I'm going in to
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:03.480]   speak with this networking group or this gala or this cocktail, and I am among
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:08.240]   friends, and I'm gonna have fun with this one, and I'm gonna have fun with this one, and we're
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.480]   just gonna keep it moving." And it's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get another drink," and "Oh,
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.160]   you know, I gotta go say hi to this person." Oh, and it's like that jumping
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.600]   when you're with your boys. It's like jumping, and then they might be in the
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.440]   middle, "Oh, you know what? Forgive me. I need to go see somebody over here. Oh, I
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:29.360]   think I recognize him. Oh, you know what? I just remembered." It's just like organic.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:33.440]   But you have to get rid of the fear. And I think one thing I took away from this
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.480]   was if you're going in with the right intentions, and you're kind in the first
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.200]   half of the conversation, then the kind of breakup of the conversation is pretty
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.080]   hard. Sure, someone might take offense to it because they really wanted to be
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:53.360]   there for longer. But if you accept that you can't control other people's
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.840]   feelings, but you did it with the right approach and the right intent, and you
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.680]   came in with genuine curiosity, I feel like you can live with the fact that
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.760]   someone could be offended and kind of get over that fear.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.000]   I really don't think anybody's thinking that hard. I think that they're doing the
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.400]   same thing you are. They're wanting to talk to enough people. I think if you
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.360]   think of yourself as having more in common than different with the people in
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.240]   the room, then it's a lot easier. Like everybody else is trying to talk to as
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.240]   many people too.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.240]   Yep.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.800]   They're not thinking about, "Oh my god, they broke up with me in that
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:29.480]   conversation." They're not. No. Be kind to yourself and realize they're not
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.320]   thinking about you all that much. They like you, but they're not going to trip.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.960]   I can't remember who wrote this or said this recently, but people always assume
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.140]   that everyone's thinking about them. What they wore that day, how they misspoke.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.160]   But the reality is that most people don't spend any of their time thinking
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:49.080]   about you or the other people. They're mostly thinking about themselves. And
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.480]   just coming to terms with that makes it easier in so many situations in life to
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.000]   say, "Maybe someone didn't even hear me," or "Think about it," or "It didn't
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.360]   even last for longer than a moment in their mind."
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.160]   We all have our own stuff that we're dealing with. We have to remember that as
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.400]   much as we think or maybe even agonize over the things that we have to do or the
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.240]   dreams that we have to achieve, other people are taking the same amount of
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:15.200]   time working on their own stuff. And even if they had a moment with you where
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.960]   it's like, "Oh, I thought that they were like this and they're like that," or
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.520]   "Oh, I thought I knew them," it's like they get over it with the next thing that
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:30.620]   comes along. So yeah, don't sweat it. Just have fun.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.760]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it. Life comes at
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:39.880]   you fast. But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang. So
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:45.000]   kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.040]   easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.240]   of the supplies. All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.720]   doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.740]   sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.240]   another week. With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.920]   off your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.960]   houses without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   across multiple stores. So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.040]   were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.920]   in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store. So
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.840]   whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com. That's
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:45.120]   D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today. Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations. I just

[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.520]   supporting those who support us. I want to get to a few tactical things before
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.720]   we wrap. You had a bunch of ideas in the book about scheduling kindness
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.560]   into your day, building it into a habit. I'm curious if you just walk through a
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.040]   few examples of how people could practice this and just hone those skills
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:22.480]   today or tomorrow or over the next week. Yeah, well until kindness just as a
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.160]   muscle becomes developed where it's this natural organic process of always
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:31.600]   thinking about how can I express to other people that I'm with them, that I'm
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.760]   for them. Think about who you can call on a regular basis. My mentor, Bill Krauss, he
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.840]   would give his business advice to those who he coached like spend an hour on
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:47.080]   past, an hour on present, and an hour on future. So that means like call your past
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.200]   clients, check in on them every single day, even if you're in sales and you
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:53.880]   don't have any leads right now. You reaching out to people who are your past
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.960]   clients is going to reconnect you and for nothing else other than to just say
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.600]   hey thank you for your business in the past. Thank you for the relationship that
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.120]   we've been able to build over the years. Present would be those that you're
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.240]   working on currently and then future those who you're endeavoring to land.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.000]   Just reaching out and giving those friendly phone calls even if it's 5-10
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.080]   minutes. I recently went to an event and I met all these people and I gathered
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.360]   these business cards actually sitting right here to my right of me and I took
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.560]   some time a couple weeks ago and I just like reached out on text message to all
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.960]   those people and then this was the week that I was gonna reach out my phone to
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:33.080]   some of them. But it was just a matter of scheduling out time in my day and for
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.640]   nothing else other than to either check in, say hello, or ask for the answer to
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.720]   some questions for like 5-15 minutes for each person. I think that's a really good
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.960]   way to not forget the people who have been kind to you and believed in you and
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.800]   have supported you and invested. So that's a really easy way to do it and
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.600]   then with your friendships. Friendships are such a big part of our lives and a
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.760]   lot of times as we get busy or even those who get married and start having
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.080]   kids the friendships fade into the background but those are the kind of the
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.160]   spine of how you can stand steady in crazy times and in hard times. So
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:15.440]   checking in whether that's once a month or once a week and just saying hey I
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:20.000]   didn't need anything I'm just calling to say I appreciate you I'm looking forward
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.560]   to the next time we can hang out. These are like relational things but they're
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:29.720]   really kind acts that people get too busy for in the midst of hustling in the
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:34.880]   midst of trying to make it to the next step on the economic food chain. Once you
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.840]   do that I think it's sometimes easier to do kindness to strangers whether it's
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.200]   opening a door, paying for somebody's coffee or lunch in line ahead of you and
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.600]   just like scheduling once a month I'm gonna do a surprise kindness to a
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.360]   stranger. That makes you feel connected to the larger neighborhood or community
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.400]   that you're in and you actually feel like a world changer every single time
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.120]   rather than just somebody who's going through the motions not smiling and not
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.200]   speaking to anybody just going and getting your Uber Eats delivery
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.480]   downstairs or your Instacart order. Let's all remind each other that we are
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.760]   connected that we need each other. It's as simple as a phone call or a text or
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.520]   sending a video to somebody and saying hey I was thinking about you you're
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:17.600]   amazing you're a rock star. Talk to you soon you know. There was an app a long
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.680]   time ago that I wish still existed that would sync across all of your texts and
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.640]   your emails and be like hey here's a person you haven't reached out to in any
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.960]   year. So if anyone's listening and knows of something new that does that let me
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:33.640]   know it would be great. I don't want to know who I haven't emailed in six months
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.600]   because maybe I texted them maybe I called them maybe I saw them on my
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.640]   calendar but if you could somehow bring all that together it would be incredible.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.800]   I assume there's a big privacy element there and hopefully it's a company that
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:51.200]   you could trust but one thing you said which was you have a mentor and you
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.000]   talk about mentors in the book being invaluable tour guides. How has that
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.480]   worked in your career and in your life and what advice would you give to
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.440]   someone who maybe doesn't have a mentor right now? I'd be really clear on what
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.800]   you expect out of a mentor relationship. I think that a lot of people think they
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.280]   know what mentoring is and it's like oh I want somebody that has my back. I want
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.760]   somebody who will check in on me. I want somebody who will give me advice but
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.920]   mentoring relationships are extremely intimate if you let them be and a mentor
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   has a lot to give you but they also have a lot at stake. Their time could be
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.280]   better served by something that's not as emotionally invested as mentoring. They
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.640]   could be doing business deal and even if they're relational as people and they
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:35.960]   love quality time the fact is is that when you mentor somebody you're giving
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:40.400]   them some of that feedback or some of that constructive content that could be
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.920]   taken wrong and people's feelings get hurt in mentoring relationships and
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.560]   people feel betrayed or people feel like they don't get me when you're
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.560]   establishing a relationship with somebody who you almost are giving the
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.040]   power to say no. You're giving them the power to look into your life and be more
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.560]   vulnerable with them which can be very scary to some people and so I would just
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:06.240]   take stock of where you are in your life, how honest you want to live and how
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.100]   teachable you are right now. Are you willing to be told that what you're
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.840]   doing is absolutely wrong? Are you willing to be told that you need to make
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.640]   course corrections in order to become the person that you say you want to
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.120]   become? If you are really honest with yourself and you can see that you want
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:24.240]   that then you're eligible for a mentor and then in terms of like connecting
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.800]   with the right mentor it really is a matter of starting off almost like you
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:32.200]   would in a relationship obviously no romantic interest. You don't just jump
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.280]   to third base with somebody that you're interested in. You start off with maybe a
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.680]   DM or you ask them for their phone number at the grocery store or you ask
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.680]   them to coffee. Typically you don't just jump straight to dinner with people. I
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:49.360]   mean sometimes you do I guess but it's a nurturing process so rather than ask
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.560]   somebody will you mentor me I think the best thing to do is can I get 5 to 15
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:58.320]   minutes with you and once you give yourself and them that space to get to
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:03.240]   know you and you get to know them then check in again hey I'd love another 5
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:07.080]   15 minute check-in like we haven't talked in four weeks like how are you
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.760]   and show genuine interest in that mentor. Don't just look for them to be genuinely
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:16.520]   interested in you and answer all your questions. How can you be interested in
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.560]   them and what they bring to the table? That word reciprocity always comes to my
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:26.120]   mind like how are you seeing their value while you're hoping that they see yours?
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.160]   Are you valuing their time? Are you valuing that experience that they bring
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.920]   to the table? Are you valuing the fact that they might be going through
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.200]   something in life and are you willing to check in with them and say not like how
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:40.800]   are you as if you're their counselor but hey is you know what I'm willing to do
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:45.560]   what I need to do to spend time with you and you notice them study them don't say
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.880]   is there anything I can do for you because they're gonna say no. Study them
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   and find out. Notice if it's at the office that they don't have an
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.880]   assistant on Fridays. They only have an assistant four days a week. Hey I noticed
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.160]   that on Fridays your staff isn't filled up or don't even mention that just say
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.360]   I'd like to give you an hour of my time on Fridays is there anything I can do in
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.760]   regards to and then be super specific bookkeeping or can I help run get some
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.200]   coffee. You might be at a level of your experience that you would never be
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.780]   getting coffee like that's for an intern to do but I remember there was one
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.220]   executive at one of my previous jobs and I knew how she took her coffee and I
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.920]   would just show up and bring it to her. There was never an expectation and
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.400]   every time I did I got a thank-you email. It bonded us. It created a relationship
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.200]   with us where I could go in and speak to her pretty much anytime I wanted to but
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.160]   many people are looking at mentoring relationships and making demands of what
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.580]   they think a mentor should do for them. They're not knowingly doing this. It's
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.960]   not like people have come in there with an attitude or an air about them. It's
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.200]   just like you have to understand there's a service element to somebody mentoring
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.560]   you and volunteering that time and for you being a serving kind person back to
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   them. So if you're willing to do anything I think you can have the right mentor
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.520]   and have a wonderful relationship. I think an important takeaway that I
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.480]   learned as an investor and as an entrepreneur with investors while your
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.300]   investors aren't necessarily mentors in some ways they are but a big thing is to
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.480]   not make your offer to help more work. So oftentimes people would say "Hey is there
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.040]   anybody you can introduce me to that would help?" and my answer would be like "I
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.360]   don't know" but some people I took this from them and then applied it myself
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.560]   would say "Hey I looked on your LinkedIn. You know these six people who I think
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.640]   could be valuable to what I'm doing. Would you be willing to make an
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.160]   introduction? Here is a copy and paste thing you could use if it's helpful." Like
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.760]   the more you can do the work to ask for help, the more people are willing to help
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.620]   and then what you said that I really liked which is a perfect segue to my
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:49.880]   next question is show that you're willing to take their advice. Because I
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.440]   think people get a lot of personal satisfaction knowing that their advice
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.680]   is actually being put to use versus knowing that it's just being heard and
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.020]   sitting there. So I said I'd come back to asking you with all of your experience
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.160]   interviewing. I know it'll benefit the show if I can improve my skills. I know
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.120]   it'll make me more fulfilled if I do better. You can choose to give advice to
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.160]   a podcaster who's one year into interviewing or you can go direct and
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.400]   give it straight to me. Whatever makes you more comfortable. I could take
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   anything feedback wise. What do you have for me? Based on how you ask questions, I
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.720]   think you want to do such a good job. And when we're hungry to do a good job,
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:34.000]   sometimes we can not listen as attentively because we're so wanting to
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.280]   do the best. And I think if you like take the pressure off of yourself a little
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.320]   bit. I think you're humble but I think at the same time you're not comparing
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.720]   yourself in a competitive way. But you're saying well this person has done
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.720]   A, B and C and D and I've done this. And it's like but you have something else to
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.040]   bring to the table. When people are doing something new they try so hard to be so
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:00.120]   good that some of their sensory gifts whether it's listening or whether it's
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:07.160]   eye contact or whether it's just feeling can get tuned out. So just flow like a
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.680]   little bit more. This is not a critique. It's more just like taking you to the
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.360]   next level. Because you have a great voice and you do ask good questions like
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.440]   what you just gave. This is advice you got from investors. I love that. Like that
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.080]   made me want to ask you another question about what you've learned from
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.480]   investors. No matter what your experiences in podcasting. You've had
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.120]   amazing experiences in entrepreneurial or the business community. I might start
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:39.920]   with that at the top of your podcast rather than a story that the Lord of the
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.600]   Flies I think is what you referenced in the beginning. Not bad. What would you
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.320]   think is your expertise? Like what's your strength in terms of what you bring?
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.040]   I've had the entrepreneur and the investor path and then I'm also this
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.960]   kind of crazy researcher where like when I want to learn about a thing. Whether
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:01.400]   it's a stroller that we're buying for a baby or a vacation. Like I will go so
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.680]   deep on the research to try to understand every nuance to it. I think
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.600]   those two elements of my life are like the optimizer and then the like
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.360]   entrepreneur investor. I think that you should start with those strengths that
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.560]   at the top of your interviews. I thought it was cool that you used a story to
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.160]   introduce me. I thought that was kind of neat. But just what you said at the very
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.760]   end piqued my interest. And I think piquing the interest of the interviewee
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.200]   makes for a more mutual conversation rather than you asking questions like
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.680]   they're the expert and I'm just here to ask them questions to get this great
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.220]   thing. It'll become much more of an interesting interview when you allow
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:44.720]   that part of you to shine more and not to minimize it. I would think most people
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.040]   when you ask them do you have any questions they usually don't right? No.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.920]   They never have one. Yeah not really. Like where do I look? It's kind of like what
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.360]   you said. Don't make them helping you more work. And I was saying how don't ask
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.920]   them is there anything I can do for you. That question of do you have any
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.840]   questions is kind of like is there anything I can do for you. Because
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.640]   they're not thinking about any questions. They're like I'm sitting here you told
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.020]   me where to go. But I would say you have a lot more experience than I do in some
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:16.280]   areas of business. A lot more. And I could learn from you. And so rather than
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.340]   coming off like I'm such a great business mind I would want you to at
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.560]   least show up with enough of this is what I bring to the table but I know
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.640]   that I'm interviewing fill-in-the-blank because they bring something else to the
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.320]   table that I know you who are listening needs. Does that make sense? Yeah it
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.720]   totally does. And it's funny because I usually record the intros after and so
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.920]   as I was giving I was like yeah if this doesn't work I'll redo it. And so if I
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.640]   end up redoing that half of what you just said will be very confusing to
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.040]   people. But maybe I'll post the original intro somewhere else for anyone
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.240]   listening if I end up making that decision. So this has been really
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.040]   fantastic. I'm gonna take a lot of that to heart just to be clear. If you want to
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.760]   keep listening in the coming weeks hopefully you'll see better introductions
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:06.560]   and more infusion of things that I know to a conversation that can make it more
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.920]   reciprocal as you mentioned in the book. Yeah, you have a lot to offer. Thank you
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.600]   for giving feedback. I ask for it a lot. I don't always get it. So it's very
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.840]   welcomed. Yeah. One question I like to ask everyone at the end of every episode is
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.400]   for someone coming to a city you're familiar with. Could be where you live
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.520]   now, where you've lived in the past, place to have a meal with someone, place to
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:32.600]   grab a drink and something unusual, some kind of activity to do. Okay. So I live
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.440]   in Chicago now. And I absolutely fell in love with Chicago. I had no intention of
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.320]   living here. I always thought I would live on the coasts, LA or New York,
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.440]   especially in my business. And when this opportunity came about, I came here first
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.600]   as a visiting correspondent when I worked for my previous job. But I just
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.920]   noticed the architecture was so beautiful and the downtown area. I mean
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.920]   there's a beach with a magnificent skyline and a river all in the same area.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.080]   Like you can do everything. So when it's sunny outside like it is now, like you'll
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.160]   see boats all in the river and on the lake and it's just gorgeous. The light
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.800]   hitting off all these buildings. So the one thing that I would say is if you
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.680]   come to Chicago, you have to do the Chicago architectural tour. The city is
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.320]   seen in a way unlike any other way you can actually witness it. They tell you
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.120]   about the history of the city of Chicago, who founded the city, why the buildings
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.480]   are built the way they are, who built them. Some of the most world-renowned
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.560]   architects have their work on display here in the city of Chicago. For dinner
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.240]   there's way too many options. I just had high tea at the Peninsula. So for anybody
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.000]   who loves that like London experience, it was phenomenal with a live string duet.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.400]   I mean again like there's just a little something for everybody and you will get
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.320]   some of the best pizza in the world whether it's deep dish or it's thin
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.280]   crust. But just walking through the city and seeing all the different
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.640]   neighborhoods because every single neighborhood in Chicago has its own
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:06.160]   personality and you have it all within a few miles. I definitely appeal to people
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.640]   to come to Chicago if they've never been and check it out. It is one of the most
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.040]   magnificent cities I think not just in the US but in the world. I have been to
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.200]   Chicago a few times. I agree in the summer I didn't really realize there was
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.680]   a beach. So I would say if you're going to Chicago in the summer, prepare for a
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.480]   beach day. This is the kind of beach day I didn't expect where people are throwing
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.800]   frisbees, drinking beer, sitting on the sand. It kind of blew my mind because as
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.680]   a non-local it wasn't something I expected. But I have a question for you
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.760]   if you're done with my questions. Yeah. Tell me one other thing that you've
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.720]   learned from investors that you think every person should know that sometimes
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.480]   they overlook or they're really in too much of a rush to pay attention to. I
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:56.160]   think something that I learned as an investor and an entrepreneur at the same
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:01.600]   time was that as much as people schedule a lot of time to have a conversation,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:09.000]   they're making a decision in the first moments that is often unchanged. So if
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.240]   you're trying to tell a story about your company, don't have the story come 10
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.600]   minutes in. It's like a rule of social media and videos on YouTube. It's like
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.200]   you got to captivate someone in the first 10 seconds. Well, when you're
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.560]   meeting an investor, when you're trying to explain your company, it's like the
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:29.280]   first minute or two that matters. So if you aren't good at doing that with
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.440]   writing, then I wouldn't try to send the description of your company with enough
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.960]   detail that someone could make that decision in an email. If you feel like
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.800]   whatever the medium that's best for you, if your data shows well, have that be the
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.560]   first few slides and email it. If it's the story about how connected you are to
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.640]   the mission of the company and the reason it was created, make sure that
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.680]   comes across first. And don't feel like you have to follow any guidelines around
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.400]   what the arc of an investor's conversation is. And this probably applies
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.760]   in many other sales tactics or professional environments. But so many
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.760]   times people said what they think you wanted to hear. By the end, I would often
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.840]   give feedback and say, "Hey, you should lead with this story." I would give it
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.640]   away. "We're not investing. I'm really sorry. This is not a good fit for us
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.960]   right now. But if you're giving this pitch again, this is the piece of the
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.200]   story that I would start with." And if anyone listening wants a little deeper
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.560]   dive, Sunil Gupta, who wrote a book called Backable, we had a conversation --I
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.800]   don't remember the episode number, but I'll link it in the show notes-- where he
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   talked about how he completely changed the narrative of his stories as an
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.240]   entrepreneur, because the story of why he was there was actually the thing that
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.000]   got people excited. Even though he thought that company had good metrics or
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   a good, well-designed product, that story turns out the most powerful thing. And he
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.440]   had to rechange everything to focus on it and focus on it really early.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.720]   That's very good advice. And that's like the elevator close. But again, stories
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.280]   sell. And being able to tell that in the first 60 seconds, it's true. Because
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.680]   people are making an impression or they have an impression of you right
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.760]   away. And one of the gentlemen in my life who works with me says, "Adrienne, the
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.400]   first answer is always the right answer and everything else is BS."
