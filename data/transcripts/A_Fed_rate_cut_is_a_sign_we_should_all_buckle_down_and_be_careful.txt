[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai, and I want to talk about the Fed rate cut.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.400]   This is the first time in 10 years we've had a Fed rate cut, and this is interesting because
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.060]   it's the 10-year anniversary of the global financial crisis in 2009.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.200]   We can learn several things from July 31st rate cut.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   One, the Fed screwed up in December 2018 by hiking rates for the ninth time in three years.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.520]   Cutting rates just seven and a half months after hiking rates is like getting a divorce
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.800]   within a year.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.720]   The signs were everywhere that it wasn't going to last, but the couple simply chose not to
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.480]   look because they were just too horny.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.720]   Two, the Treasury bond market is a better indicator of the economy's health and dictates
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.160]   the proper interest rate policy, not the Fed.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.100]   All year and parts of last year, the yield curve has been flat or inverted, telling the
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.080]   Fed it needed to cut rates as growth slowed.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.040]   But they waited too long until they finally relented.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.600]   Three, the Federal Open Market Committee members may have PhDs and plenty of financial experience,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.920]   but they are often just guessing at the best course of action, just like the rest of us.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.240]   Do not treat their word as God.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.360]   Do not underestimate your own abilities to make money either.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.520]   You don't want to rely on someone else to make you rich.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.640]   That's a suboptimal decision, because that someone could make you poor as well.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.240]   And then finally, we should all be on high alert for an impending recession within the
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.620]   next 12 to 18 months.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.880]   The more the Fed cuts, especially when rates are already this low, the more we should worry.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.040]   The Fed funds the range right now is 2% to 2.25%.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.320]   There's not that much more room to cut.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.080]   If we look at history, we know that recessions always follow euphoria.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.520]   Due to my experience working through the 2000 dot-com bubble and the 2008 housing bubble,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.480]   I've learned that the greatest downturns tend to happen right after the most euphoric of
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   times.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.640]   I remember in 1999, working on Wall Street, investing in internet stocks every single
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   day.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.080]   You could make 50%, 100% in a few short months, sometimes in days.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.120]   You know, remember those B2B companies, the Ariba networks, Broadcom?
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.600]   Yahoo was just going crazy, everything.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.000]   And we just felt like we couldn't lose.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.280]   And of course, in 2000, March 2000, things just stopped going up.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.960]   And the Nasdaq proceeded to implode for the next several years, and everybody, well, a
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   lot of people got fired.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   Same thing in 2007.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   Man, 2007 was a fantastic time.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.520]   Career-wise, stock market-wise, real estate, everything was going gangbusters.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.280]   And then of course, a couple of companies folded, like Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   and then it was just an unraveling of confidence.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.620]   So if you look at my post, you'll see this cool chart on the market cycle.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.400]   I think we're currently in the euphoria complacency cycle.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   And after complacency comes anxiety, denial, fear, panic.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.240]   We're going down, down, down.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.620]   Then anger.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.860]   And then depression.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.120]   And then we kind of hit the bottom as we're depressed.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.180]   And then we go up with hope, relief, and then optimism, excitement, thrill, and then back
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.500]   to euphoria, complacency, and then so forth.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.720]   That's the way it is, folks.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.640]   This is boom and bust.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.160]   We've been in a bull market since 2009, and the majority of us are the richest we've ever
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.320]   been.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.400]   Let's not brag here.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Let's just be honest.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.040]   Let's look at our net worth.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.160]   Over the past 5, 10 years, if you have been diligently saving and investing, you should
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.320]   be at your highest net worth point in your entire life.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.920]   And when you're at that point, it's understandable to be punched drunk with financial happiness.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.760]   It's understandable to spend more money than you normally would or take on debt at higher
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.480]   interest rates and so forth.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.920]   The median age in America is 38 years old, which means that about half of the US population
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.460]   has never significantly lost money in the stock market or real estate market or any
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.460]   risk assets.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.800]   And so when so many of us feel like we can't lose, we can often lose the most.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.480]   So here are some late cycle indicators.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.960]   One, the rise of the financial independence retire early movement.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.760]   I've been writing about FIRE since 2009 with zero fanfare until circa 2017.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.720]   Now you can't go a day without reading or watching an early retirement story.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.520]   And I know I'm definitely contributing to that because I've continued to write about
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.320]   the early retirement lifestyle.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.520]   But that's no different from what I was doing 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.280]   It's just that it's just this big, big frenzy now.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.840]   Two, the rise in remote and freelance work.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.440]   Going to work in an old stuffy office is very passe.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.100]   According to the Freelancers Union and various studies, by 2027, more than 50% of American
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.840]   workers will be freelancers versus about 40% today.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.120]   And I bet you didn't know that we're already at 40%.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.800]   That's a lot.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.360]   The return of zero money down purchases for homes to compete for more business.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.240]   Lenders are rapidly lowering their standards just like they did before the housing bust.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.720]   You're seeing online real estate marketplace companies like Zillow get into the flipping
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.100]   business.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.800]   That's also a late cycle indicator.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   Four, the explosion, explosion of credit growth despite credit card interest rate reaching
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.560]   five-year highs.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.680]   Credit card interest rate, the average is about 18% now.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.640]   Nobody should be borrowing on a credit card.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.340]   18% versus 2% on the 10-year bond yield, that is a 9x differential.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.280]   And that's high-rate robbery, folks.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.800]   And if you look at the consumer confidence index, we're also at all-time highs at about
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.460]   138.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.400]   So that is about matching the time right before the dot-com bubble bust.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.760]   So because we're so overconfident, we're willing to pay sky-high interest rates because we
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   think we're going to continue making lots and lots of money.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   And then finally, insiders from companies like Beyond Meat cashing out to retail investors
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   through a secondary offering after the price of the stock went up like 5x.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.440]   I mean, come on.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   How can you guys be so cruel?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.800]   I know you guys want to cash out, but man, do you really have to take advantage of the
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.240]   poor retail investor who's like, "Whoa, the stock is up 5x.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.520]   I got to buy right now."
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.460]   And then my personal favorite, when 23-year-olds making $30,000 a year tell me they have no
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.000]   problem retiring early because within 20 years, they'll have amassed $2 million in net worth
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.080]   by eating at Applebee's every day, never spending any income on fun and earning a 12% plus compounded
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.580]   return.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.520]   That to me, folks, is a sign that we are at max euphoria.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.080]   That's a little bit delirious type thinking, illogical thinking.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.080]   You can't really see through it, and that is a sign.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.400]   So a Fed rate cut always precedes a recession.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.760]   You may not accept any of my late cycle indicators or believe my stories about euphoric people
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.160]   who think they just can't lose, but what you can believe is the Fed itself and that the
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.200]   data it provides.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.480]   If you go to my post, "The Fed Rate Cut is a Sign We Should All Buckle Down and Be Careful,"
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.880]   you'll see this chart that highlights the Fed cutting rates, and then within 12 to 18
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.960]   months, a recession follows.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.280]   So I'm counting back to 1950.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.680]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.280]   It's happened eight times out of, it looks like about 10 times.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.640]   It's important to understand that a recession does not occur because the Fed has cut rates.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.680]   A recession follows because of the normal boom-bust cycle of the economy.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:06.560]   The Fed is only making reactionary moves no matter how hard it tries to predict the future.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.280]   The Fed cannot do so very well.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.120]   If you look at the chart, there's these huge spikes up in the Fed funds rate and down,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.660]   and then recessions every five to 10 years because the Fed can't get it right.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.600]   We already saw this when they hiked rates in December 2018 and then cut seven and a
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.840]   half months later.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:31.360]   The Fed is only making reactionary moves because it is unable to predict accurately an economic
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   cycle.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.560]   The classic boom-bust cycle can be illustrated by the housing market.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:43.080]   The time lapse between when developers first realize there's so much demand and then meets
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.160]   this demand for housing may be years because it takes time to build new apartment buildings
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.240]   and single family homes.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.760]   If you come to San Francisco, I'm trying to build an auxiliary dwelling unit.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.740]   It's going to take six months to get approval, and then I've got to build the thing and go
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.920]   through the various permit phases and so forth.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.600]   It's kind of a nightmare, but you can just kind of wait and get someone to do it for
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   you.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.500]   But by the time all that supply hits the market, it's just going to suppress and crush prices.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.760]   You're seeing that right now in 2019 in places like Seattle and in New York City.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.440]   There's a lot of supply going on because a lot of these developers built several years
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.720]   ago when times were really, really good.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.520]   So the key is to have a large enough balance sheet to build and invest counter-cyclically
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.400]   and not at record high prices.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.040]   It feels terrible investing when prices are down, things are sluggish, but you've got
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.480]   to practice doing that because that's when the future returns are going to be the best.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.480]   So you can check out the post.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.920]   There's a market quadrant cycle.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.720]   It's from a classic book from Mueller, Real Estate Finance, 1995.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.360]   And when we talk about the Fed, it's important to realize about moral suasion and gibberish,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   frankly.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.600]   Alan Greenspan was famous for gibberish where he talked for hours and hours, and you just
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.760]   couldn't figure out what the hell he meant and what he was saying is just gibberish.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.800]   And the reason why is because the Fed is kind of scared, it knows its power, and it knows
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:24.400]   if it says to the world, "Hey, we see a slowdown on the horizon," it knows that the markets
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:30.560]   and investors and just the public in general will probably freak out a little bit and accelerate
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.640]   that downturn and probably overshoot it.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   And same thing on the upside.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.760]   We tend to overshoot and undershoot all year history long.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.040]   It's just the way we are because of the boom and bust cycle.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.000]   So if the Fed can continue to speak in more gibberish and only cut rates this one time,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.200]   maybe two times at 25 basis point increments, the euphoria/complacency stage will likely
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.800]   continue.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.520]   After all, borrowing costs are lower and the Fed is signaling the economy is strong enough
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.340]   not to warrant further cuts.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.520]   This is really key here.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.560]   But if the Fed starts to cut interest rates more than two times and in larger increments,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.800]   then a recession will most likely hit and the S&P 500 will most likely decline months
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   from now.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.080]   And we just look at that through the history of what's happened before.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.600]   After a 75 basis point cut, three months later, the S&P 500 is down about 4%, six months later,
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.520]   down about 4%.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.920]   It generally doesn't look good six months later.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   In the beginning, a little euphoric again, "Oh yeah, cheaper money.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.960]   The Fed is on our side."
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.400]   But six months, 12 months, it's looking pretty dicey.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.920]   The key to reaching and maintaining financial independence is to avoid blowups.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.220]   The blowups are what ruin lives because they not only rob you of your money, but of your
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.760]   precious time.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:58.840]   You'd rather lose 1%, 2%, 3% here and there in terms of performance if you can sidestep
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.440]   a 30% to 50% decline.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.760]   So if you lose 50%, you got to get 100% return to get back to even and who knows how long
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.500]   that's going to take.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.540]   You cannot afford a financial blowup if you're retired, you plan to retire within three to
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.700]   five years, have dependents, have a disability which may reduce your ability to work for
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.760]   longer than a potential recovery, don't have enough passive income to cover your basic
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.280]   living expenses, or you're simply delusional about your abilities in the future.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.600]   If you're still within the first 10 years of your financial journey, okay, you can afford
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.560]   to take more risk.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.200]   Eat an Applebee's every day, never plan to have kids or take care of friends or family
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.180]   members or give to charity or whatever.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.180]   That's fine.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.180]   It's all you.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.180]   All you, you, you.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.200]   You have nobody to care about but you.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.720]   But for regular folks, I suggest being more cautious at this stage in the cycle.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.160]   Please don't have any revolving credit card debt ever.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.440]   18% interest rate is a freaking ripoff and this is why there are companies sprouting
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   all over the place in Silicon Valley doing personal loans because they're thinking, "Oh,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.600]   we're going to help you consolidate your debt at 18% for only 14%."
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.680]   It's still a ripoff, folks, and these companies are doing very well, these personal loan companies.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   Pay attention.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.840]   Avoid these personal loan debts.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.280]   Please don't be tempted into buying a car either because your car interest rate is now
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.960]   0.25% lower.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   That's just silly.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.760]   The average car price is like $38,000 now versus the median household income of $62,000
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.240]   pre-tax and you got to spend $38,000 after tax.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.360]   Try to stick to my 1/10th rule for car buying, folks.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.320]   I know it's a little bit arduous but look, trust me when I say that a car is going to
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.880]   be one of your first worst financial mistakes.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.600]   Do refinance your mortgage and take advantage of lower rates.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.120]   The bond market has already given us a chance to refinance our mortgage for the past three
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   months and now the Fed is saying, "Okay, fine.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   You're right.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.600]   I don't want to have this yield curve inversion."
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.320]   Borrowing long-term money when the yield curve is flat or inverted is like free money, folks.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.120]   If you can refinance and break even within 24 months and plan to own the house for years
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.240]   afterward, longer the better, forever the better, then you should refinance.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.960]   And then do save aggressively with banks that pay a higher interest rate than the current
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   10-year bond yield.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.080]   The current 10-year bond yield as of August 2019 is under 2% now.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:42.960]   That's like 1.9%, but you can get a risk-free online bank interest rate for 2.3%.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.280]   That's a 40 basis point arbitrage, folks.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:51.600]   If you had trillions of dollars, you would be taking advantage of that arb all day long
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   for free money and just kicking back and laughing.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.160]   And that's what we should do, and that's what I've done, and that's what you should do.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:05.040]   Also, don't be so naive as to wish a financial crisis on the world so you can "buy out"
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   assets for cheap.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.520]   I hear this all the time.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.480]   I'm going to buy assets for cheap when the economy crashes and the stock market goes
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.480]   down 80%.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:19.000]   Yeah, look, asset valuations are a reflection of their projected cash flow.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.520]   A stock is not cheap if its price halves and its earnings decline by 90% over the next
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.920]   several years.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.160]   In fact, the stock has gotten a lot more expensive.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.440]   Besides, you might not even have a job that will give you the guts to buy on the cheap.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.880]   So don't be delusional in this type of thinking here.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.840]   Be consistent in your investing strategy.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   And most of all, learn to enjoy your life regardless of where you are in the cycle.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.280]   If you're on top of your finances and you're investing in a risk-appropriate manner, you
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.800]   should be pretty fine no matter what happens.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.280]   It's only those people who have risk exposure incongruent with their risk tolerance who
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   lose big.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.880]   So don't be like those people.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.440]   I hope this episode has given you some things to think about.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.280]   Definitely click over to the post to check out the amazing charts that I provided that
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.680]   help you visualize where we are in the cycle.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's up to you to decide how much risk you want to take because we're all on different
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.280]   parts of our financial journey.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.880]   For me, I'm more conservative than average because I'm older than average and I have
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.840]   a family to take care of now.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.480]   And I want to make sure that my wealth continues to steadily go upward over time.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.360]   I just don't want to go in reverse because I've gone into reverse many times before or
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.280]   enough times before and I just never want to go back.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.120]   So only you can decide.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.080]   And it's 6.08 a.m. right now.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   I've been up since 5 a.m. and I still got a couple more hours before my boy and my wife
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   wake up.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.760]   So I'm going to go back to bed now and wish for the best.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   Sweet dreams everyone.
