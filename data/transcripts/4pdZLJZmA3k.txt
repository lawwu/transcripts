[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]   I felt we could do nothing better as we start these series of meetings than to
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.000]   consider this well-known phrase which is to be found in the 11th verse of the
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.920]   second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. You remember that it
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.480]   comes in this great passage in which we're given an account of the outpouring
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.680]   of the Holy Spirit upon the early church on the day of Pentecost and how the
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.040]   people who'd come together for the feast of Pentecost from different parts of the
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.320]   Mediterranean world all began to hear these apostles upon whom the Spirit had
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.560]   descended speaking in strange tongues. And what we have here is their reaction
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.880]   of what they said, these different people, Cretes and Arabians, etc. They said we do
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.760]   hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. And it's this
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.160]   phrase that I felt would be appropriate for our consideration at this first
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.640]   meeting. And that because it seems to me to remind us of something that many of
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.600]   us, you know, need to be reminded of very sadly and very sorely at this
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.840]   present time. I'm concerned as far as my addresses are involved in this Congress
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   to be practical. So I think we can best start by facing the general situation in
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.600]   which we find ourselves. And I need waste none of your time in pointing out to the
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.440]   critical days through which we are passing. One of the greatest dangers I
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.200]   think at the present moment is complacency. And perhaps as Christian
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.800]   people we are unusually prone to this. A failure to realize the extraordinary
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.400]   crisis through which we are passing. There's no question at all we are living
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.000]   in one of the great climactic periods in the whole history of the human race. One
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.480]   of those great turning points in history. It isn't given to every generation of
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.040]   people to live at such a time. But we undoubtedly are living in one of the
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.960]   great crises in the whole history of the human race. We're all in general familiar
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.240]   with this situation. Take the state of the country in general. We're all aware
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.720]   of this problem of so-called permissiveness. But still more serious it
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.400]   seems to me is the spirit of lawlessness and of rebellion that are at the
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.720]   back of it and that have produced it. We are living in an age when the things to
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.000]   which many of us have always been accustomed and indeed generations before
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.160]   us have been accustomed are thrown into the melting pot of being questioned and
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   queried. It's an age of rebellion and we've got to realize this. And in this
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.560]   age we find the church, the Christian Church, speaking generally in a very sad
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.480]   condition. Dwindling attendances, dwindling memberships and so on. People
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.160]   regard the church as more or less outmoded and there is a tendency on the
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.480]   part of people to turn to new experiments. House meetings, gatherings in
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.800]   different places, different movements are coming into being and various cults
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.760]   rising round and about us. But to me perhaps still more serious than all that
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:00.360]   is a wave of anti-intellectualism, an antagonism to rational thinking which is
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.760]   becoming increasingly evident. From one standpoint of course there's something
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.040]   that one can but welcome in all this. The rationalism with which we once had to
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.000]   contend was something that was very opposed to the gospel. But it's
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.880]   interesting to notice that that seems to have worked itself out and the leaders
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.280]   of the Bloomsbury set and others, these intellectuals who were so prominent in
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.600]   the 30s and in the 20s also, are no longer as popular as they were. There's a
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.640]   reaction against it and against all thought in a sense. And people are now
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:49.600]   craving for an experience. They want to feel something they say. So there is this
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.160]   great longing and desire for something that will enable people to feel
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.280]   something and to experience something. And as you know there are many who are
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.760]   turning to drugs in order to get this. And others are turning to various
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.080]   religious movements or semi-religious movements at any rate. With this desire
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.120]   to get something experimental. They say we are tired of mere talk and mere
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   theory and mere instruction. They want something dynamic, something living or as
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:33.080]   they would put it, something real. Now there is in general the atmosphere in
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   which we find ourselves. And I have no doubt that many of you are meeting this
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.720]   problem in a very direct and personal way through your own children. This
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.120]   spirit of revolt has come in and it's affecting the children of Christian
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.760]   people. I'm being questioned increasingly about this in my present it itinerant
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.640]   kind of ministry. And the people are very perplexed by all this. But there it is in
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.300]   its essence. Now if you look at the history of the Christian Church over the
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.320]   centuries, you'll find that it's always been a history of up and down. The graph
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.800]   of the history of the Church is not one of continual rising. It's up and down and
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.960]   up and down. Well there's no doubt at all about it but that we are down in the
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.320]   very depth of a very deep trough at this present time. And what I'm anxious to do
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:34.160]   tonight is to consider the causes of this. As to why we are in this powerless
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.320]   condition. Why does the Church count for so little? And why are people turning
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.840]   away to these other things in order to get what they would regard as something
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:53.560]   real or living and vital? And I want to make a suggestion that this is very
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:03.000]   largely due to the fact, as I see things, that we have a tendency to forget God or
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.280]   at any rate to forget the living God, the acting God. And I believe that this is
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.440]   one of the most urgent problems confronting us. If I were asked to name
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:28.920]   what has been the main defect even of evangelical Christianity in the last 40
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.080]   years or so, I would say that it's this. A tendency to forget or to take for
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:44.320]   granted the living God. Now this is something that's done in many ways. There
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.440]   are many who are guilty of this because they equate religion, to use a general
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.720]   term, with morality only and decency. This doesn't apply so much to
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.760]   evangelical people of course but it does apply to many. There are many who go to
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.920]   churches regularly still, perhaps out of habit or custom, doesn't matter what, but
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.400]   they do go, but their real view is that religion means morality. You remember
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   Matthew Arnold's definition of religion. He said religion is morality tinged with
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.720]   emotion. And I believe that that is the view that many people have of
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.560]   Christianity and of religion in general. But more serious is this other idea of
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.840]   what one may call religion without God. This at first of course seems to be
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.160]   impossible but it's a very real thing. I'll never forget the shock I received, it
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   must be some 35 years ago if not more, when I read a book bearing that title
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:57.000]   "Religion without God" by the famous American preacher Fulton Sheen, Dr.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.520]   Fulton Sheen. And he was able to make out the case very simply that so much of
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.760]   practicing religion is religion without God. This is quite an amazing thing. Many
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.360]   do this quite unconsciously. If you charge them with it they defend
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.400]   themselves and yet in actual practice that is what they're doing. They're
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.280]   attending a place of worship out of habit or custom or tradition or they're
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.000]   mainly interested in their own activities in a church or in some
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.080]   religious organization. They're unconscious of the fact that what they're
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.180]   doing is really without God. But there is a conscious form of this at the present
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:49.860]   time. And you're aware of the talk about religionless Christianity, Bonhoeffer's
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.260]   phrase and so on, and others have taken it up and driven it still further. And
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.740]   the death of God idea in America. This was put in an article I was reading
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.860]   recently by an American writer very clearly like this. He said God as a
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:11.740]   supernatural agent intervening in history and nature is no longer
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.580]   credible. And that's what was really at the back of the so-called death of God
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:25.980]   movement. They've got into the habit of thinking of religion in practical terms,
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:33.100]   social, political action and things of that kind. And God as such and as he has
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.380]   been regarded and worshipped throughout the centuries is no longer believed in.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.380]   In other words we are confronted by a new kind of deism to put it generally.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.660]   You had it in a different form at the end of the 17th and beginning of the
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:54.380]   18th century. But today it takes this particular form. There's another cause of
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:00.300]   it. Then another is that I believe we've often been in danger of turning
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:07.020]   Christianity into a kind of cult. And I believe that this has even taken place
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.860]   at times in our evangelism. So much of the evangelism has been conceived mainly
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.980]   in terms of human activity. A number of people make a decision to have a
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.220]   campaign or something and they work up an organization, they have a committee
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.820]   and everything is signed, sealed and settled. And then somebody reminds us at
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:35.940]   the end that we must have, to use the phrase, prayer backing. We've decided
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.180]   everything and then we feel we just need a little backing. So you have a sub
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.220]   committee to look after the prayer side of the proceedings. But in addition to
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.700]   that, very often people have been given the impression that as long as they say
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.140]   that they're ready to subscribe to a number of statements that they're
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:04.460]   therefore Christians. And a decision is taken and this is regarded as being
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.740]   adequate and sufficient. Certain propositions are put to you, do you
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.100]   accept them? If you do, very well, you've become a Christian. You may sign a card
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.380]   or you may not. But the thing is to accept a number of beliefs or of
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:26.300]   propositions or of statements. And often nothing more is demanded or required.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:34.060]   But then another cause of this forgetfulness of God, which is such a
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:43.860]   terrifying and terrible thing, is that we have a tendency to turn our whole
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:52.900]   thinking about these matters into an interest in certain truths about God.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:13:01.980]   What I mean is this, we're ever in danger of substituting apologetics for a
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.780]   belief in and an experience of the living God. We can spend the whole of our
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:13.620]   time in pursuing our apologetics. Now, apologetics are always necessary. People
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.940]   have difficulties with their faith and it's our business to help them. But there
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.020]   is always the danger that we start and end with our apologetics. The same thing
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.420]   is true of an interest in theology. One of the greatest dangers confronting any
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:36.780]   theologian is to forget God. In our interest in truths about God, we forget
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.660]   all about God. And God becomes a subject that we read about in a textbook and we
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:47.420]   discuss together, very much as we do any other subject. This has always, of course,
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.460]   been a danger. There's nothing new about the danger. But I believe we've been
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.820]   particularly prone to it. And this has been the case very largely because we've
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.860]   generally had to be on the defensive. We've been a minority as evangelicals
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:07.180]   and we've been living in a theological atmosphere which is very
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.940]   critical and very liberal. And we've always been having to defend our
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:22.620]   position. And unconsciously, we can drop into this state in which we're expert at
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:29.580]   apologetics and our theology. We develop a kind of scholasticism and the living
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:35.660]   God is entirely forgotten. Now, I could illustrate all this very easily from the
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.780]   past history of the Christian Church. There have been periods in the history
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.180]   of the Church when she's been perfectly orthodox but utterly dead. Great
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.820]   interest in apologetics, great interest in theology, and all these things, but no
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:54.860]   life. And she hasn't counted in the community. I believe there's a very real
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:00.740]   danger of this at the present time. And then in these present days, there is
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:07.500]   another form which this is taking. And it is the danger or the tendency to turn
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:16.620]   the Christian faith into a philosophy, into what's called a life and worldview.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:22.140]   Now, this is very popular at the present time. I think it's one of the latest
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:28.220]   crazes and you're most of you probably familiar with it. Everybody's talking
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.500]   today about the Christian attitude, the Christian attitude towards war, the
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.420]   Christian attitude towards peace, Christian attitude towards politics,
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.060]   Christian attitude towards industry, Christian attitude towards modern art,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:49.180]   modern literature, modern drama, Christian attitude. This is the thing now. And
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.900]   everybody's concerned about the application of Christianity. Again, it's
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.260]   very interesting to observe the way in which these emphases and movements tend
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:06.060]   to arise. I'm old enough to remember a time when in evangelical circles that
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.580]   kind of thing was never mentioned at all. And indeed, not only was it not mentioned
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.940]   if you dared to mention them, I think a query was put up as to whether you were
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.500]   truly evangelical or not. The idea that an evangelical Christian should take any
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.740]   interest in politics or in art or in drama, the thing was unthinkable. He'd be
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:30.020]   suspect at once. But by today, if you don't talk a lot about these things, you
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.580]   are now queried as to whether you're an evangelical at all. We've gone full
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:40.820]   circle. And thus I feel that in this tendency to turn our faith into a
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:47.620]   philosophy and into a series of attitudes, we are forgetting God. And
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.380]   there are some who don't hesitate to say that the church as such should be
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.300]   abolished. You shouldn't meet together in church and go through a service and
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.220]   listen to a sermon. You ought to be sitting in the drawing room or whatever
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.660]   it is of your neighbors next door and discussing politics with them, whatever
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.700]   they happen to be interested in. And that this is the way in which this should be
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.340]   done. And there are those who say that the prime task of the Christian is to
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.140]   show the lordship of Christ in every realm and department of life. And that we
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.540]   ought to be spending most of our time in doing this and not in personal
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:27.140]   evangelism and so on. But what I'm concerned about is that in doing all
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:37.380]   this, God, the acting, living God, seems to be forgotten. And another strand in this
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:43.140]   tendency, I would say, has been the teaching which has told us that at
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.580]   regeneration we received everything we can ever receive. And all we have to do
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:55.140]   from there on is to surrender ourselves to what we've already got. Now all this,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:05.580]   you see, leads to this, that the emphasis is all along on man and man's activity.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.620]   We've believed, we've become Christians, we're trying to surrender ourselves to
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:17.980]   what we've got. And the idea is that we just go on doing this in these various
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:24.940]   ways. Apologetics, theology, this new interest in the philosophical aspect, and
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:31.860]   outworking, and so on. And I have a feeling, and it troubles me a great deal,
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:38.900]   that as all this has been going on, we have been forgetting the most important
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.140]   thing of all, the living God. Of course we believe in God, but God is there
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:51.660]   somewhere in the distance. He's static, he's impassive, and he responds to what
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:59.500]   we do. But the emphasis is upon us, and our activity, and our energy. And God is
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.260]   there somewhere in the distance, and we invoke him, as I say, when we are
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:11.860]   conscious of the need of a certain amount of help. Now my whole thesis, my
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:19.900]   whole suggestion is that it is this that accounts for the present condition. And
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.460]   that if it continues, the circumstances in which we find ourselves will
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.300]   degenerate still further. And that we shall find the young people in
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:37.900]   particular, is leading us. Because we are failing to present them with something
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:46.820]   dynamic, something gripping, something moving, something experimental, in a deep
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:54.940]   and in a radical sense. But of course, the real trouble with this kind of tendency
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.780]   which I'm describing, is that it is so contrary to the biblical teaching. And
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:06.420]   this to me is the tragedy of the whole situation. That the Christian Church can
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:14.460]   be apparently so dead and ineffective, while she's got an open Bible. Where the
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:22.300]   message surely above everything else, is an emphasis upon God. The wonderful works
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:30.140]   of God. The Bible is everywhere a record of what God has been doing, and what God
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:37.300]   is going to do. And God's plan, and God's purpose. We've been so concerned about
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.420]   ourselves, and arriving in a certain position, and our activities, and so on.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:49.500]   That I feel we've been forgetting what is after all, the ultimate truth, and the
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   ultimate element in all these matters. Haven't you noticed how often the
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   psalmist will contrast the God of Israel with the idols of the other nations? And
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.860]   that's the point that he always makes. That these gods, though they've given them
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.980]   eyes, they can't see. They've given them hands, they can't carry anything. They can't walk,
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.740]   though they've got legs, they can't speak. And this is contrasted with the living
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:26.980]   God. The God who acts. And you remember Paul preaching in Thessalonica, and he
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.580]   writes to them afterwards and says, "How you turn to God from idols to serve the
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:40.580]   living, and the true God." Now all this surely is of very great importance for
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:46.580]   us at this present time. We've been defending the faith, we've indulged in
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.060]   our apologetics, we've been trying to show this interest in people, and in
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.900]   their lives, and in what they do, and so on. But I suggest that we are not touching
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.180]   them, and that there is only one hope in this present crisis through which we are
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:07.340]   passing. And that is that the Christian Church becomes a phenomenon. You see, she
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:12.540]   started as a phenomenon. This was it, this is what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.420]   Something had happened to these people, and they became a great phenomenon. And
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.340]   people came rushing together from everywhere to see them. And the book of
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.620]   Acts is full of this, this extraordinary phenomenon that came into the world. And
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.540]   people were arrested and apprehended, whatever they had been by nature, and by
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:38.380]   upbringing, and tradition, and so on. And I see no hope until we've recaptured this,
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:44.180]   till we've rediscovered this. Now this of course is something that has happened
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:51.220]   many times before. As I say, the Church goes through these phases. But what seems
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.420]   to me to be so sad at the present time is that we're not learning the lessons
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.860]   of history, and not learning the great lesson of the Bible itself. Where the
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:06.740]   whole emphasis is upon God and his activity. Let me hurriedly give you a
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.620]   review of the teaching in order to show what I mean. You're all familiar with it.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.940]   We're all familiar with it. But this is what we tend to take for granted. We tend
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.100]   to forget. Now the Bible starts, you see, with this great declaration that in the
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.740]   beginning God created. That's our fundamental postulate. We don't start
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:32.340]   with men, we start with God. We mustn't start with men. Men's in this world, but
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.460]   where does he come from? Where does the world come from? We must start with God,
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:49.020]   as the Bible does. And all along this record tells us what God has done. How
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.940]   when men sinned, and brought down shame upon himself, and was bewildered, and
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:01.980]   didn't know what to do, God came down in the cool of the evening into the garden.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:09.060]   And spoke to the men, and said certain things to him, by way of condemnation, and
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:18.620]   by way of hope. This is it. Hurry on with the story. You come to the flood. God
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:26.340]   intervening, doing so in judgment, making it known to Noah before him. But God
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:32.100]   doing something. God intervening. God, this is where deism went so wrong. God
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.300]   didn't merely create the world, and having made it like a great watchmaker,
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.340]   put the watch down, and then forget all about it, and let it go on. The whole
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.860]   message of the Bible is that God intervenes. God is concerned. God acts. God
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.420]   is involved in all this, and erupts into it all. He's not away in the distance
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.060]   somewhere, and we are doing everything, and occasionally turning to God. It's the
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:58.380]   other way around. It's the activity of God. And then after the flood, you come on
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:04.780]   to the great story of the call of Abraham. This is the activity of God. That
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:11.020]   man was a pagan, in Ur of the Chaldeans, and God visited him. God spoke to him. God
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:19.460]   called him out, and God told him what to do. Jacob at Bethel, Jacob at Penuel. You
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:24.340]   know these stories. The great story of Joseph. It's all along the activity of
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.300]   God. Joseph himself puts it in that memorable statement, you remember, he
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.380]   made to his brothers, when feeling their guilt for having sold him, and so on. He
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.820]   said, "You didn't do it. God did this. God did it to send me down to prepare the way
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.900]   for you, and to prepare for this famine that he knew was coming." All along, it's
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.580]   God's action. And then you come to the whole story of Moses, and it strikes him
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:55.820]   everywhere. His birth is being saved in the way he was from destruction. His
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:01.620]   early life, how God led him backwards and forwards, the giving of the law, the
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.740]   amazing story of the Exodus and the Red Sea. Haven't you often felt it as you read
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.540]   those chapters in the book of Exodus? You can almost feel the presence of the
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.420]   living God, the tension and the crisis, these little people, and the hosts of
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   Pharaoh and their chariots coming behind them, and the Red Sea in front of them,
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.940]   Pihiroth and Beelzebub. What can they do? It's all hopeless. God intervenes.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.500]   Now this is the essence of the teaching and of the history
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:38.180]   everywhere. You get it in exactly the same way in the story of Joshua, the book
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:46.500]   of Judges, Samuel and the things God did through Samuel, the calling of David, God
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.660]   intervening constantly to save these people. They forgot him. They thought they
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.940]   could do things without him, and they always got into trouble. And then they
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.540]   turned to God in their desperation, and God heard them and came back and
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.860]   delivered them and scattered their enemies. The great prophetic message. These
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:09.540]   men were not just seers. They were not just unusually able men with some
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.820]   peculiar insight beyond most others. They all say that they received a burden from
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:20.460]   the Lord. They were given the message. It's all supernatural. It is all God
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.380]   acting and dealing with them, and always giving this great promise of what God
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.220]   was going to do. And then you come to the last of this great series of prophets, as
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:38.860]   it were, John the Baptist. And here's another man who was called, prepared from
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:44.820]   his mother's womb. The whole story of John the Baptist is the activity of God,
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:50.500]   the preparation of the forerunner and his extraordinary message. The
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:57.260]   annunciation to Mary. It's always God. God sending his messengers, these
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:03.540]   archangels, informing them what he was going to do. In other words, the whole
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:10.820]   basis of our position is the activity of the living God coming to its climax.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.700]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:22.620]   made under the law to redeem them that were under the law. And then you look at
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:29.460]   him and what you see. Well, it is his activity that strikes us. His miracles.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:35.860]   Not only his teaching, but his miracles, his actions, the finger of God, as he put
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:44.300]   it himself. All this, you see, is a part of this great message. And then the
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.700]   meaning of his death. As Peter put it on the day of Pentecost, this was no mere
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.500]   action of men. It was the hands of men who actually did it. But it happened, as
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.020]   says Peter, according to the predeterminate counsel and for knowledge
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:04.060]   of God. This is God's plan. This is God's scheme of redemption. This is God's world.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.580]   So he's doing something about it. He's promised and he's prepared. At last this
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:14.740]   great event takes place. But all along the activity is the activity of God.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:21.620]   Doing things that amaze people and astound them. Then, as I say, beyond the
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:28.660]   death to the resurrection. This action, this mighty action, without which there
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:34.420]   would never have been a Christian Church. His ascension. And on this day of
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:40.260]   Pentecost, the descent of the Spirit. Now these were the things that these
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:47.500]   apostles were talking about. These marvelous, amazing acts of God. The
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:57.300]   wonderful works of God. This is the essence of the Christian message. And as
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.500]   you go on reading the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you find that this
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:07.180]   continued. It didn't end on the day of Pentecost. These men continued with these
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.420]   amazing and mighty acts. And were very careful to say that it wasn't their
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.260]   action. You remember Peter and John having healed the men at the beautiful
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.540]   gate of the temple. And the people had come together and were almost ready to
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:23.860]   worship them. They say, "We haven't done this. It isn't us. It isn't any particular
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:29.420]   power that's in us. It's his name, through faith in his name. This Jesus." And their
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.780]   preaching was that though men had killed him, God had raised him from the dead. All
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:41.260]   along this is the same emphasis. And you get it even in episodes like that of
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.460]   Ananias and Sapphira. As I said just now, you can't read that book of Acts without
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:52.860]   being conscious of this tremendous activity of God manifesting his glorious
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:59.020]   and his supernatural power. But now here comes, it seems to me, the crucial
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:04.780]   question. So many seem to give me the impression that they think it all ended
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:10.460]   then. And that since then what has happened has been that these truths have
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.220]   been preached. We've had the Bible and we've read it and studied it and it's
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:19.660]   been preached. And well we say, "Yes, this is it. These things tell us all about God."
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.860]   And well now then we believe in God and we ask him to help us to live a life to
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:30.140]   his glory and to his praise. But as I say, we seem to have the impression that we
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:37.380]   now have to do everything else. To what extent do we expect to know the action
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:45.580]   and the activity of the living God? And here I feel that church history is so
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:53.540]   important. As I say, the graph of the church is this constant up and down. What
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:59.380]   is it that has raised the church up from the periods of lethargy and of deadness
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.460]   and of hopelessness? Well there's only one answer to that. It has been invariably
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:12.100]   the intervention of God again. The eruption of God into the process. God
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:18.940]   dealing directly with a man or a group of people in the church and turning them
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:24.180]   into instruments which he can use. In other words, this is what we mean by
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:30.900]   revivals. And the great revivals in the history of the church alone account for
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:36.020]   the persistence of the church. Men constantly would have killed the church.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:41.760]   There's always this process of degeneration going on. A slackness and a
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.500]   lethargy and a formality tend to come in. The institutional element ever comes in
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.100]   and the church would have perished, there's no doubt. Centuries and centuries
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:56.860]   ago were it not for these mighty visitations of the Spirit of God. The
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.900]   great revivals in the history of the church. And all such movements of the
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:11.820]   Spirit, all such revivals, are simply God acting in this phenomenal manner. As he
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.260]   did right through the Old Testament history. As he does in the Gospels, in
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:21.180]   Christ, as he does in the power of the Spirit, in the book of the Acts of the
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:27.140]   Apostles, and so on. The same kind of activity, every revival as it's been
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:33.100]   often put, is but a repetition as it were of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.700]   Now something like this happened at the time of the Protestant Reformation. Some
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.780]   of us tend to think that the Reformation was a mere change in doctrine. It was a
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.860]   tremendous change in doctrine but it wasn't only that. It was a true revival.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.460]   People like Hugh Latimer and others who used to preach at St. Paul's Cross were
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.740]   not only great preachers but they were preaching in demonstration of the Spirit
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:03.140]   and of power. It was truly a revival. And you've had similar experiences since. Now
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:09.020]   take for instance the state of this country 200 years ago, more than 200
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:15.460]   years ago. The end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century. You're
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.260]   familiar with the fact that the moral condition of this country was then as
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:26.580]   bad probably as it is today. There wasn't the aggressive, arrogant, militant
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.820]   atheism that there is today. It was more this deism and the sleepiness on the
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.260]   part of people. But there's no question but that from the moral and religious
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:41.780]   standpoint this country was in the most deplorable condition. And you remember
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.380]   what happened? Certain people became concerned about this and like so many of
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.100]   us they said we must do something about this. Some of them formed religious
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:57.860]   societies. This started in the 1660s and the religious societies were concerned
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.020]   about morals and about conduct and behavior. They'd meet together not only
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.380]   to improve one another but try to influence society. And they did a lot of
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.860]   good work. Then you remember Robert Boyle. He formed a lectureship, started a
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.500]   lectureship and the Boyle lectures are still being given. What were they for?
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.620]   Well to defend the Christian faith. The faith was under attack. Arianism tended
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:24.180]   to come in again. And the whole basis of the faith was being queried much as it
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.480]   is today. And all this went on, the theological decline and the moral
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.300]   declension that invariably accompanies all this. Well so they started the Boyle
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.980]   lectures to defend the Christian faith. Apologetics. And you remember the great
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:43.660]   Bishop Butler. He did the same thing with his analogy of religion. And it's a very
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.180]   profound work and a most excellent work, a wonderful bit of work. But my point is
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.020]   that good though these things were they really didn't touch the situation. They
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:59.280]   didn't affect it. But something happened that did affect it. What was that? Well it
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.440]   was the evangelical revival. The evangelical awakening. How did this
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.880]   happen? There's only one explanation. It was God who acted. God laid his hand upon
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.120]   Whitefield and the Westleys and others. You can't explain it in any other terms.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.200]   And this is the thing I'm concerned to emphasize. God acted in these men. God
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.720]   worked in these men. These men became phenomena. Whitefield as you know was a
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.240]   remarkable phenomenon. And people crowded together to get him out of curiosity.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.920]   Many of them. But as a result of going there they were converted. He was a
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.600]   phenomenon. And so the Westleys became phenomena. And the others who worked at
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.520]   the same time. Now it wasn't merely that they were preaching the truth you see.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.240]   And asking for a blessing. It was that. But so much more. Something was happening
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.200]   that stirred the imagination of people. Caused people to come together. And you
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:02.240]   had to pay attention to it. It wasn't a decision on the part of men. It was God
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.720]   acting once more. And laying hold on men. And doing these wonderful things in them
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:15.080]   and through them. And so it has been with every other revival. You had revivals
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.360]   after that. Great revival in America in 1857. One of the great revivals of all
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.720]   history. And more people were added to the churches in America as the result of
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:32.120]   that one revival than for any other cause. It was phenomenal. You had the
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   same in Ulster in 1858. In Wales in 1859. And so on. Now Jonathan Edwards says and I
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:46.360]   think it can be demonstrated quite plainly. That God's way not only of
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.760]   keeping his church alive. But of adding to the church. Making his great additions
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:59.280]   to the church. Has always been through revival. He experienced you see the great
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.960]   awakening. And he wrote an account of what was happening. But he went beyond
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.120]   that. And he looked at the whole thing from the biblical standpoint. And that is
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.760]   the statement that he makes. And I believe it's absolutely true. This has
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:20.420]   been God's method throughout the centuries. And as I see things. This is
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:25.800]   our only hope at the present time. I'm not saying that you shouldn't indulge in
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.600]   apologetics. Certainly not. I've spent most of my life in dealing with
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.960]   apologetics. I sometimes think too much. However I'm not saying a word against
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.840]   the various activities. But I am suggesting this. That all this is not
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:47.680]   enough. And that in this modern situation with people crying out for something
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:54.640]   dynamic. Something living. Something experimental. They'll even turn to drugs
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.640]   in order to get it. Now we as Christians ought to be able to say the way to
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:08.560]   obtain all you require is in God. And this is possible to you. You see the
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:14.760]   kind of thing that I'm referring to is this. Do you know the story of that great
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:20.880]   experience that Blaise Pascal had? Now Blaise Pascal as you know is probably the
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.440]   greatest at least one of the greatest mathematicians that has ever lived. A
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.840]   great scientist. On top of that a great philosopher. And a great literary man.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:37.800]   And he wrote his books. And they were mainly apologetic in their intent. But he
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:44.440]   had a great experience on November the 23rd 1654. And he wrote an account of it.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:52.680]   It went on he tells us from 1030 to 1230 midnight. This brilliant intellect
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:40:02.240]   intellectualist virtually. He was longing for a knowledge of God himself. He had
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.520]   great knowledge about God. But he wanted to know God. And it was given to him on
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.600]   that occasion. So he wrote on a sheet of paper which he then folded and had sewed
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:20.280]   onto the inside of his shirt. And it was found in that position when he died. This
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   is what he'd written. God of Abraham. God of Isaac. God of Jacob. Not of the
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:38.560]   philosophers and the wise. He'd had a meeting with the living God. There's a
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.520]   story told about Thomas Aquinas the author of the great Summa Theologica.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:51.080]   Great philosopher. He never finished his Summa. But he had a great experience. And
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:58.360]   he said that in that experience he had learned more about God than he had in
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:04.640]   all his study and in all his writing. And in all his meditations about these
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:12.040]   matters. Now this is the kind of thing therefore to which I am referring.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:20.000]   Nothing but a manifestation of the power of God in revival in this way is going
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.040]   to meet this present situation. You see the psalmist cries out for this. For the
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.320]   living God. As the pundit after the water brooks. His soul cries out for God.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.640]   The living God. Of course these people couldn't have lived. They couldn't have
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.400]   existed. They couldn't have triumphed but for this. Isaiah cries out to him that he
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:47.920]   would come down that it rend the heavens and come down amongst them. Read those
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.800]   chapters 63, 64 and 65 of the book of the Prophet Isaiah. How he exhorts the people
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.240]   to plead with God and not to give him peace nor rest until he has done this.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.600]   Until he descends melting the mountains in his coming. He says we are your people
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.640]   those other people are not your people. We are your people. Don't forsake us. Give
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.400]   us an authentication. This prayer for God to manifest himself and to reveal
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:21.040]   himself. And this as I say is something that has continued and has happened
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:27.160]   periodically throughout the long history of the Christian Church. But the question
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:34.520]   I'm asking is whether we have habitually thought in these terms. Whether there
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:40.520]   hasn't been a tendency amongst us to be content with these other activities. And
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.600]   I believe we are coming up to a crisis in which we shall see that all that
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   though excellent in itself is not enough. And sometimes there has even been an
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.920]   antagonism to this teaching about revival. I'm quoting from Smitenka his
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.880]   book on the Holy Spirit. He says no more mischievous and misleading theory could
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:11.360]   be propounded or one more dishonoring to the Holy Spirit than the principle that
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:18.200]   because the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost the church has no need and no
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:25.640]   warrant to pray any more for the effusion of the Spirit of God. But there
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.920]   are many people in that position. They think it's wrong to pray for an effusion
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:38.360]   of the Spirit of God. I remember in a minister's gathering to which I belong
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:44.480]   and to which I've belonged for 30 years originally started and suggested by Dr.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:53.280]   Douglas Johnson about 1958. We were discussing these matters and it was
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   clear to me from the discussion that there was a difference of opinion about
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.520]   this and that some people were not happy about this kind of teaching. So I
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.680]   remember ending the meeting on one occasion by saying this. I said I'm going
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.080]   to be a schoolmaster this time and I'm going to give you some homework to do.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.760]   And here's the question which I'll expect you to answer when we next meet.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:20.720]   In your preaching and teaching on the Holy Spirit, his person and his work, have
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:27.920]   you left any room for revival? And I'll never forget the next meeting. Before we
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.240]   even started properly on the discussion a very prominent member got up and said
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.000]   he wanted to make a statement and a confession that he had preached on the
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.360]   Holy Spirit many times in his church. He'd been lecturing at a Bible training
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.320]   college for a number of years on doctrine and the doctrine of the person
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.280]   and the work of the Holy Spirit. But he said I'm getting up to say that in my
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:56.760]   teaching there has been no room whatsoever for a visitation or an
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.960]   outpouring of the Spirit of God in what is called revival. You see the very thing
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.440]   that Smeaton deals with, he says no more mischievous or misleading theory could
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.940]   be propounded nor one more dishonoring to the Holy Spirit than the
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:15.440]   principle that because the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost the church has
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.000]   no need and no warrant to pray anymore for the effusion of the Spirit of God.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.600]   See it's not only contrary to the teaching of the scripture to say that it
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.320]   is contrary to the history of the church. The church would not be here at all
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.920]   were it not that God had repeated this from time to time and generally as the
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.120]   result of the yearnings and the longings and the prayers of his people. This is
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   then I suggest what we should pray for because as Smeaton again says men look
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:52.280]   on with awe and wonder when some supply of the Spirit of which they can neither
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:58.640]   tell the laws nor estimate the momentum breaks forth from the kingdom of God and
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:05.280]   sweeps over the community. It's a phenomenon and men are staggered as they
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.360]   were on the day of Pentecost. People look on and they said then what is this are
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.640]   these men full of new wine? Something had happened to them it wasn't merely the
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.720]   speaking with tongues it was the whole appearance of these people. It was
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.880]   everything about them suggesting some glory something amazing. Now that's been
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:29.280]   repeated in every great revival in the history of the church and I suggest that
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:35.040]   unless we believe that and see that this is the only hope at the present time
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.400]   unless beyond that we pray for this and pray without ceasing and pray urgently
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.560]   we shall find the decline of the church continuing. It's continuing at a rapid
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.160]   speed in spite of all we've done in the last 20 years. It'll increase it'll get
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.840]   worse the chaos in the moral condition will increase the position will become
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:04.080]   yet more desperate. There is only one hope and that is such an authentication
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.720]   of the truth by an outpouring of the Spirit of God by an activity of God an
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.200]   unmistakable activity of God which can't be explained in other terms as
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:20.960]   Smeaton says and as others have always said. Nothing but this can deal with the
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:28.940]   situation in which we find ourselves because when men experience something
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:36.200]   like this like Pascal described and others well then I say it is unanswerable.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:43.040]   Have you ever heard I wonder of what happened on the night of December the
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:54.840]   31st 1738 and the morning of January the 1st 1739. A number of men had gathered
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:00.600]   together for a watch night service in London amongst them Whitfield and the
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   two brothers Wesley and if ever there was a man who was not an emotionalist I
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.920]   should say it was John Wesley. I've often taken the risk of describing him as one
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.080]   of the most typical Englishman who's ever lived but there he was and Charles
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.720]   with him and many others and this is what John Wesley writes in his own
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.040]   journal you can read it for yourselves. Night of December the 31st morning of
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:35.240]   January the 1st in the change of the year from 1738 to 39 about 3 in the
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:43.520]   morning as we were continuing instant in prayer the power of God came mightily
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:52.480]   upon us in so much that many cried out for exceeding joy and many fell to the
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:49:01.800]   ground as soon as we were recovered a little from the awe and amazement at the
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:12.840]   presence of his majesty we broke out with one voice we praise thee O God we
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:20.760]   acknowledge thee to be the Lord. Do we know anything about that my friends? Do
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.960]   we believe in that possibility? Do we just dismiss that as some foolish
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:35.280]   ecstasy or do we long for it and are we determined to pray for it until God
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:41.440]   again manifests himself in an unmistakable manner in this country and
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:51.600]   a new chapter will be added to the book recording the wonderful works of God.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.040]   Let us pray.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:03.120]   Oh Lord our God we come unto thee and we come O Lord with a sense of shame.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:10.560]   Forgive us O Lord that we have not sought thee as we should. Forgive us O
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.400]   Lord that we have often even been doubtful and hesitant about these things.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:23.000]   Forgive us if we've been guilty of quenching thy spirit. O God let it be
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.400]   known this day that thou art still God in Israel. Help us O God to see the need
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:39.920]   of the hour. Bring us to an end of our self-reliance and our self-confidence.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:46.880]   Give us such a longing for a manifestation of thy power that we shall
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:53.040]   not be content until we've seen and known something of it. We pray thee
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.560]   therefore in the midst of the years to revive thy work in wrath to remember
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:05.360]   mercy. Have pity upon us O Lord. Have pity upon us as thy people. We languish, we
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:11.280]   seem so ineffective in a world that is dying of despair and desperate and
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:17.040]   hopeless and young people asking for experiences that can satisfy and we seem
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.600]   to be unable to point them to the one source where they can ever find them.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:28.960]   O God grant that we may be such people that we shall be living witnesses, living
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:36.600]   witnesses of these things and able to point them unto thee who alone can give
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:43.280]   men the touch of life and of power that will ever assure them that thou art the
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:51.000]   only true and living God. We pray thee therefore O Lord to look upon us and to
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.420]   search us and to try us and our ways in the light of thy most holy word. Pardon
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:02.700]   and forgive us for the inadequacy of our service, the unworthiness of our
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:09.280]   stewardship. Cleanse us in the blood of Christ and make of us such that thou
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:15.640]   canst use us to thy glory and to thy praise. Hear us in the name of thy dear
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:24.000]   Son and now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.880]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.680]   this night and evermore. Amen.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.600]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
