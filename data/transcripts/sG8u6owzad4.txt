[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   If I hate you, that's great,
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.300]   but if I have a story to support that hate,
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.560]   ah, that's even better.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.360]   - One of your favorite words, jihad.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.220]   (laughing)
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.860]   - That's my favorite hobbies.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.760]   It doesn't matter now who do you vote into power,
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.060]   they will not listen to you,
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.740]   they would listen to the people who paid them to be there.
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.260]   When the military came in,
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.340]   people were walking to me like,
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.300]   pointing their fingers like,
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.820]   don't speak about CCU, don't speak about the army.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.220]   We love you now, but don't you, they were like that.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.340]   So I called Jon Stewart, I was like,
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.340]   I don't know what to do.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.460]   And he said the most interesting thing ever.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.720]   And say, if you're afraid of something,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.060]   make fun about the fact that you're afraid of it.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.020]   The following is a conversation with Bassem Youssef,
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.820]   a legendary Egyptian American comedian,
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.900]   the so-called Jon Stewart of the Middle East,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.340]   who fearlessly satirized those in power,
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.660]   even when his job and life were on the line.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.040]   Bassem is a beautiful human being.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.220]   It was truly a pleasure for me to get to know him
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.340]   and to have this fun, fascinating
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.020]   and challenging conversation.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.060]   This is Alex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.220]   in the description.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.020]   And now, dear friends, here's Bassem Youssef.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.620]   Your wife is half Palestinian,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.540]   and I've heard you say that you've been trying to kill her,
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.420]   but she keeps using the kids as human shields.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.800]   So have you considered negotiating a ceasefire?
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.340]   - Well, the thing is, every day,
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.540]   every minute of the day in a married life is a negotiation.
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.460]   Everything can blow up into a full-scale war,
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.580]   starting from a simple sentence like, good morning.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.780]   What should we do with the kids today?
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.620]   What should we do with that piece of furniture?
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.180]   Any sentence can lead you to heaven
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.620]   or to hell in the same time.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.140]   - So you do negotiate with terrorists?
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.980]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, 100%.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.060]   - You must? - Yeah.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.460]   And for her, I am her terrorist, too, so it's equal.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.660]   - Terrorists on both sides.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.700]   On a more serious note,
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.220]   when you found out about the attacks of October 7th,
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.540]   what went through your mind?
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.420]   - If I'm allowed to use a curse word, I was like--
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.260]   - As many as possible.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.820]   - I was like, oh, shit.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.300]   Part of my stand-up comedy is I describe a situation
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.040]   where I was in a restaurant with producers,
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.060]   and there was a bombing two blocks away
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.360]   in Chelsea, New York, in 2016.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.540]   And, of course, this is the like,
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.980]   damn, what's gonna happen to us now?
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.460]   And there's like two different reactions.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.940]   There's the white reaction, which is like,
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.260]   oh, my God, I hope nobody is hurt.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.900]   This is terrible, I hope everybody's okay.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.620]   And there's the Arab reaction, what's his name?
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.460]   What is his name?
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.820]   What is the name, you know?
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.260]   Because you know what's gonna come?
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.260]   It's kind of, I was scared what's gonna really happen
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.120]   in that area, and it's like, oh, my God,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.080]   it's gonna be horrible.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.380]   And the way that it was reported,
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.360]   I didn't know how to handle this.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.560]   So I basically, I went into hiding for a few days,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   three, four days, and I talked about Piers Morgan team
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880]   talking to me two times, three times.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.680]   I was like, no, I can't, how can I defend that?
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   How can you defend the rape, the decapitated babies,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.520]   and whatever?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.720]   And then I started kind of looking in the news a little bit,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.000]   and then I started seeing people coming on the shows
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.940]   and saying things that I know as an Arab, as a Muslim,
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.560]   as someone from that region, that it's not true.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.060]   But I didn't know how to, what to say, how to say it.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.980]   So I said, by the third time when they asked me,
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.220]   I said like, fine, put me on.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.540]   And I went there, it was more of a, figuratively speaking,
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.540]   a suicide mission, because it's a lose-lose situation.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.340]   I can lose stuff in Hollywood.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.700]   I can, I even, I remember my managers like,
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.740]   Bassem, be careful, I mean, are you sure you wanna do it?
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.660]   My managers was like, please don't do it, please don't do it.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.660]   And on the other side, if I don't perform well,
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.660]   whatever well means, I'm gonna be rejected by my own people.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.900]   So it was a lose-lose situation,
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.740]   because whatever I say, it will never be enough,
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.220]   and whatever I say will not be good enough.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.220]   And I was going into there, and I felt that I was going
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.700]   into a trance for the 33 minutes that I was on the,
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.180]   on that interview for the first time.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.980]   - You blacked out. - I blacked out.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.940]   I blacked out, and a lot of people ask me,
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.900]   is the earpiece, was that a bit,
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.540]   when the earpiece kept falling, it's like,
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.340]   no, it was really falling off, and it disconnected,
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.980]   and I had to save it, because I cannot see them,
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.460]   all I can hear, I can just hear them,
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.060]   and I could expect it at any time,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.620]   okay, Bassem, thank you, and it's like,
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.900]   I was fighting for every second to say words,
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   to put stuff in there.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.860]   - Yeah, for people who don't know,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.040]   this is your conversation interview with Piers Morgan,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.780]   and you couldn't see.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.660]   - I couldn't see, I was just like,
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.500]   that lens with the camera, and I was just like--
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.140]   - It was like a surreal dream or nightmare.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.140]   - Yeah, hello, Bassem, I was like, hello, Bassem,
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.700]   I was like, hi. (laughs)
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.540]   - And it could end at any moment,
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.780]   your career and everything.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.340]   - Everything, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.380]   - So what was the drive that got you to actually do it,
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.640]   to overcome that fear?
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.020]   - Multiple things.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.940]   First of all, I don't wanna say it's just my wife's family,
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500]   because my wife's family has always been there,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.740]   but this time was different.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.700]   The bombing, the attack, they usually,
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.020]   one of those people that they're away for everything,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.420]   whatever happened in Gaza, they are always in safe places,
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.160]   but this time, it seems that there was no place safe,
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   and already we heard about two or three of the cousins
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.980]   and the uncles already lost their home,
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.100]   so this was too much.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.540]   So I wanted to say something for those people,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.540]   because I know that, one of the jokes that I made,
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.180]   I was like, oh, it's Hassan, her cousin, he's a loser.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.540]   He's a doctor, he's a doctor.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.780]   And he, every time a hospital was bombed,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.740]   we were worried about him.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.100]   So I wanted to say that because I felt that these are,
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.580]   this is a family that I have never seen in my life.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.660]   I have never, she actually hardly saw an uncle or two,
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.580]   because they cannot leave.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.820]   But I said, I need to speak, at least I do something
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.660]   for those extended family that I have never known,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.660]   but also because when Piers Morgan team
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.060]   called me a couple of times and said,
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.140]   okay, let's see what's going on in the show,
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.220]   and I just watched the stuff, and the lies,
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.580]   and the one-sided reporting, that made my blood boil.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.780]   And then I thought, what am I afraid of?
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.740]   I'm afraid of, if I say something,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.820]   I can lose my career, it's like, wait a minute.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.540]   But that was the reason why I left Egypt.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.980]   I said, wait, I left Egypt, I came to United States.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.300]   I came to a land of the free,
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.140]   where I can say anything I want.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.940]   And yet I have limitation of what to say.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.740]   I mean, I thought we left that shit behind.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.980]   I mean, what's happening?
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.140]   And I understand, I understand the connection
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.180]   of how sensitive it is when you speak about Israel,
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.380]   and all of the ready-made accusations.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.620]   But as an Arab, as a Muslim,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.420]   I don't react the same when you talk about Saudi Arabia,
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.980]   or Iran, or Egypt, or any of them.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.060]   It's like, hey, you wanna diss some of these countries?
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.780]   I'll do that with you,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.660]   because I have strong opinions about what happened,
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.900]   and I already been expressing them.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.540]   But when I talk, when that's why I speak,
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.340]   and there's a lot of Jewish people who come to my show,
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.340]   and they understand that.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.260]   They understand the separation.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.020]   But that kind of grouping of blackmailing people,
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.300]   and saying and not saying what they have in their mind,
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.580]   it is that kind of like one of the things
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.700]   that kind of like pushed me to go on the show.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.060]   - The thing that was bothering you,
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.940]   was it what was being said, or how it was being said?
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.340]   - Both.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.340]   Because there are lies, which is usually in the media,
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.980]   but there was the total disregard of humanity.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.260]   You talk a lot about, in your show, about human suffering.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.220]   And I felt that here, the human suffering was not equal.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.820]   I felt, that's why I came up with this,
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.940]   like what's the exchange rate today?
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.100]   What's the exchange rate today?
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.300]   There's, of course, it's terrible to see anybody die,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   but I feel that like, isn't our life not worth anything?
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.220]   - Yeah, you had a chart, akin to crypto,
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.620]   from an, you analyze it from an investing perspective,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.020]   of course, in a dark human kind of way.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.060]   - That's the ROI on that.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.860]   (both laughing)
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.060]   - And you were saying that a certain year was a good year.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.220]   - Yeah, 2014.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.540]   - 2014 was a good year for investment purposes.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.260]   And also, to refer to the family member
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.660]   that you called a loser, you were saying that,
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.140]   you called him, had a conversation with him,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.420]   and he keeps saying that he's not using anybody
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.300]   for human shields, and you called him a loser.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.780]   What are you, you can't even give a job.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.460]   - The liar, he lied to us, because I have to believe,
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.100]   but this is the one thing, it's like,
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.180]   it's also one of the things, like how it was said.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.900]   It was stuff that I've been hearing,
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.860]   I don't know what turned on in my head,
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.260]   but it's stuff that I've been hearing
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.900]   all my life from the media.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.740]   Israel warns civilians before bombing them,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.220]   and that's okay, but that's not okay.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.940]   Israel is trying to minimize the civilians,
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.140]   but killing them anyway, and that's okay,
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.580]   but that's not okay.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.540]   So it is kind of like the indoctrination
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.620]   that we've been hearing, as if it is okay,
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.260]   and then suddenly, it's not.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.580]   - Yeah, there's a kind of, several layers of bullshit,
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.580]   almost sometimes hiding the obvious horror of the situation
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.540]   with kind of politeness and all this kind of stuff,
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.580]   just the basic value of human life.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.540]   That said, it's a difficult situation.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.700]   - It is, it is.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.180]   - What would you do if you were Israel?
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.700]   BB called you, awesome, big fan, big fan of your comedy.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.500]   First of all, would you hang up right away?
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.460]   Would you hear him out?
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.940]   - No, I would definitely hear him out.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.780]   (laughing)
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.220]   That's like, that was like, wait a minute,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.900]   that's material, that's material, man.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.740]   (laughing)
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.340]   It's like, so Netanyahu called me.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.900]   (laughing)
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.740]   I was sitting with my family, just like,
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.740]   I have my phone ready, like, oh, Netanyahu.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.660]   (laughing)
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.740]   Yeah, it just shows up that way.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.780]   I mean, what would you do?
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.380]   What would you do in this situation?
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.820]   - To answer this question,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.740]   we need to understand how Israel thinks.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.500]   There is an incredible speech given by Gideon Levy
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.620]   at a famous Israeli report in Haaretz,
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.900]   and he describes a situation
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.180]   where he was in the West Bank, and there was a checkpoint.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.460]   And in that checkpoint, there was an ambulance
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.420]   with a Palestinian patient,
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   and it was there sitting for an hour and a half, not moving.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.540]   And then he went to talk to the soldiers, like,
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.980]   guys, why are you not letting them go?
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.780]   It's like, ah, let them go, it's like,
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.540]   and then he told them, imagine if he was your father.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.420]   And the soldiers stood up, it's like, what?
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.620]   These are pigs, these are not humans.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.980]   So when you tell me, what would you do if Israel would do,
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.620]   it really needs to, we need to ask,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.540]   how does Israel look at the Palestinians
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.660]   and view the Palestinians,
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.500]   because they do look at them less than human.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.420]   And there is an incredible talk by Mehor Meyer.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.020]   He was a Holocaust survivor, and he said,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.620]   I learned in Auschwitz when I was there
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.980]   in the concentration camp that in order for a group,
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.020]   a dominant group of people to dehumanize another group,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.380]   they need first to dehumanize themselves.
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.700]   And Israel looks at Palestinians as lesser people,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.700]   as lesser beings, as some people who are dispensable.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.860]   And the way that they treat them
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.340]   is that they don't really care about,
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.620]   that's why that the exchange rate thing.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.300]   So for me, if I am Israel, it will be like,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.740]   what would you do if you're the United States
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.580]   in the time of the Native Americans?
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.920]   They were killing people with the millions.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.620]   When you dehumanize a group of people, you really don't care.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.840]   So if I was Israel, I would do exactly
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.140]   what Israel is doing right now,
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.020]   because there's no one who's holding me accountable,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.740]   there's no one stopping me,
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.660]   and I can get whatever I want
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.020]   throughout my history through violence.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.500]   - I think a lot of the things you just said
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.660]   are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.380]   So let me try, let's try. - Please, please, please.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.420]   - So not everybody in Israel.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.140]   - Of course. - So let's look at
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.220]   several groups.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.460]   So people in government, IDF soldiers,
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.060]   and citizens that are neither of those.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.620]   And not everybody of any of those
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.820]   sees Palestinians as less than human, just some percentage.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.580]   So what percentage is that in your sense?
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.220]   - It's the people who have the power.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.220]   - So it's mostly the focus of your commentary
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.460]   when you say people in Israel,
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.340]   you really mean the people in power.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.180]   - The people have the power.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.380]   But as much as, of course, I mean the people in power,
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.540]   because when I speak about,
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.740]   even when I speak about America,
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.580]   I speak about people in power.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.740]   When I speak about Egypt, I speak the people in power,
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.020]   because I can't really talk about
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.500]   the 100 million people in Egypt,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.060]   or the 11 million people in Israel.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.620]   Of course not, there are people who go in
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.260]   and they demonstrate against Netanyahu
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.620]   and they want him out of the government.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.220]   But we have to admit that the Israeli society,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.700]   it at a whole, have moved quite a bit to the right,
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.100]   and has been many extreme.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.680]   And you know what happens when you go to the right,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.260]   or you go to the most extreme,
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.140]   the other person go to the most extreme.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.180]   And extremism breeds extremism.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.220]   So thank you for the clarification,
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.820]   but I really meant with the people of power.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.020]   When people criticize the United States
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.780]   for going in Iraq, of course I'm not criticizing citizens.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.060]   - But you made another point,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.300]   which is an interesting point,
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.700]   and it's very difficult to see in the heart of people.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.540]   But I wonder if you look at the average Palestinian
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.500]   and the average Israeli, and when they look at the other,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.140]   do they have some hate in their heart?
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.640]   Well, everybody probably has some.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.240]   What is that amount?
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.880]   You know, when you look at a person
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.840]   that looks different than you, how much hate is there?
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   - It depends on what is the specific situation
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.680]   of each person.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.600]   So in the Berlin Film Festival,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.840]   just like a few, couple of weeks ago,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.240]   there was an Israeli and a Palestinian
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.960]   receiving an award together.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.680]   And the Israeli director said,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.320]   "We're gonna go back to Israel.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.720]   "He's gonna go to the West Bank.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.640]   "He will have no rights,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.800]   "and I will have full living rights."
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.160]   These people managed to work together and be friends,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.960]   and they have empathy to each other.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.400]   Now, the average Palestinian,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.000]   it's a very difficult question
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.320]   because is it the Palestinian in the diaspora,
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.760]   or the Palestinian in Gaza,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.440]   or the diaspora in the West Bank,
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.160]   or the one in the citizen, as a citizen of Israel,
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.760]   who still have less right than a Roman citizen of Israel,
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.600]   a Jew.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.880]   And it really depends if I am,
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.840]   there are people in, Arabs in Israel,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.600]   who are having a great life.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.800]   And there are people, Arabs, who are having a miserable life.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.680]   But definitely people that living in Gaza
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.520]   or in the West Bank is kind of like on the lower tier
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.640]   of their living conditions.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.520]   Now, let's talk about the hate.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.960]   What does that Palestinian see with the Israeli?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.680]   The Palestinian see oppression,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.360]   limitation of movement, limitation of freedom.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.400]   They have, and then when there's something happens,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.360]   you see the full force coming in,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   destroying their home, taking away members of his family.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.720]   There will be absolutely no reason for him to love the other.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.320]   The Israeli, because he doesn't have the power,
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.880]   but he lives under his government,
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.760]   all he sees is the rockets or whatever,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.720]   but he sees the reaction,
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.960]   and he doesn't see what happened to those.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.600]   And as humans, we are selfish.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.280]   We see what really affects us as humans.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.840]   And I cannot even imagine what it would be like
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.520]   to live as a Palestinian.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.040]   And I'm not gonna talk about Gaza,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.240]   because everybody talks about Gaza.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.480]   But let me give you an example.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.920]   And I'm not gonna talk about the 12,000 kids killed in Gaza.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.120]   Let's talk about just like the four weeks in the West Bank.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.520]   March 4th, Amr Najjar, age 10,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.000]   sitting next to his father,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.200]   shot while he's sitting in a car next to his father
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.240]   by the IDF soldiers.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.360]   Mohamed Ziad, 13 years old,
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.600]   March 3rd, shot in front of a UN school
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.560]   while sitting with his friends.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.120]   Mohamed Ghanem, age 15,
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   March 2nd, he shot while standing in front of a storefront
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.400]   during a night raid.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.800]   February 23rd, Saeed Jardal,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.200]   he was killed by a drone fire.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.360]   February 22nd, Fadi Suleiman,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.520]   killed while standing in front of the top
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.720]   of a Red Cross building.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.400]   Nihil Ziad, February 14th, Valentine's Day,
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.600]   killed a shot in the head while leaving school.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.280]   February 11th, Mohamed Khattour, US citizens,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.400]   killed while being in a parked car.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.720]   And Moaz Shams, February 9th,
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.800]   killed right in front of his home
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.920]   because a military car came reversing back to him
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.880]   and then somebody opened the door, shot him, and leave.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.280]   This is a daily life of people in the West Bank.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.120]   - What is the justification the idea provides?
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   - Terrorism.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.320]   - Terrorism.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.680]   - Or, I don't know, I mean,
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.160]   you cannot really say, like, human shields.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.800]   But they would say, like, they were throwing rocks.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.600]   There was a guy who went on Chris Rock
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.320]   and he said, like, his son, a US citizen,
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.440]   were killed, and they were throwing rocks, so he killed him.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.680]   Even when they were throwing rocks, you kill him.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.800]   But the thing is, you see,
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.040]   this is how easy for them to get rid of Palestinians.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.480]   I mean, I love, like, I was,
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   I had to say I prepared a little bit for the podcast
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.280]   because you are in tech.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.520]   So, and I am ignorant in tech.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.240]   There is a movie called "The Lab."
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   It is directed by an Israeli director called Yotam Feldman.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   And he talks about how the military industry in Israel
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.440]   is very advanced.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.540]   And what is really mind-boggling is in that movie,
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.560]   he shows how the military tests its weapons
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.080]   in the field in urban areas on Palestinians.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.400]   It is heartbreaking.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.120]   You know, as a doctor, there is five stages of trials.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.920]   There is, like, there is discovery, preclinical, clinical,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.600]   and then market, and then post-market evaluation by the FDA,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.360]   the FDA approval, and then the FDA post-market.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.640]   Five, just to take a pill.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.860]   And you go in, and he interviews people as, like,
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.580]   where did you test this?
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.840]   They test it in the field.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.740]   So, when you just, like, when human life is so cheap,
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:46.560]   and it is so indispensable, it made me,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.140]   it gave me a visceral reaction.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.180]   Because, you know, we as humans,
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.300]   this has been actually the state of humanity.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.900]   Humanity has lived and survived and thrived
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.700]   by actually killing each other.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.180]   But there was kind of a, we were remotely,
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.860]   we were removed from it.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.820]   People in Greece didn't know what Alexander the Great
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.660]   was doing.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.500]   He was killing and pillaging.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.780]   Like, we called him the Great, but he was killing.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.340]   He was conquering, he was invading.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.740]   Julius Caesar, all of the greats, he would do it.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.860]   But killing was difficult.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.460]   Killing had to have some sort.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.780]   You have to be with your enemy.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.220]   Then you go back, catapults, then cannons,
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.780]   then a little bit back.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.460]   And then you're kind of like standing remotely.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.100]   Now you're killing people behind the screen
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.020]   with a button, with a push of a button.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.860]   You know?
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.180]   A lot of people say, "Terrorism!"
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.780]   They killed you with a knife.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.420]   Killed one person with a knife, shot you.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.420]   That's terrorism.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.460]   But if you fly a $64 million F-16
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.060]   and you drop off an A-84 bomb that costs $16,000,
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.900]   that's not terrorism because it's remote.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.020]   You're behind the screen.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.860]   So, what happened?
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.900]   What Israel is doing?
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.420]   It is removing itself, like America too.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.020]   Drones, and then when you push someone to be in,
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.720]   they always brag about bombing them to the stone ages.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:06.780]   What happens when the screens and all of the obstacles
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.120]   that you have been put between you and those people
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.260]   that you have treated them this way,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.300]   when this is a breach and you come face to face,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.680]   you will come face to face with what you have created.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.720]   - Yeah, there's a lot of interesting things you just said.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.300]   So, one is the methodology of killing.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.220]   If you wanna look at some horrific large-scale killing,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.140]   people often talk about the Holocaust, but that's visceral.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.940]   You can look at Hollymore by Stalin
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.460]   where the murders through starvation.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.220]   - By Churchill in India.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.220]   - In Churchill in India, and the great leap forward by Mao.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.180]   - Yep.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.740]   - So, starvation is a thing we don't often think of it
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.380]   as murder because it's quiet, it's slow,
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.620]   and the interesting thing about starvation
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.860]   is that the people don't complain as they're dying
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.300]   because they're exhausted.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.260]   That's one, and the other is the value of human life.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.780]   It does seem that every culture
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.140]   has an unequal valuation of human life.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.020]   So, those two things combined create a complicated
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.980]   military landscape of the world.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.580]   - Yes, but the thing is, is that how we look at technology
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.980]   as the savior, as we talk about how AI will disrupt,
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.740]   will disrupt, will disrupt, and now if you go,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.420]   you talk about like going to the West Bank,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.740]   the people in the West Bank walk and they don't see humans.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.340]   They see people shouting them from towers
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.940]   or behind the screens or doing,
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.380]   and they have like biometrics that is developed
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.180]   by Basel system, like that's done by HP
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.500]   or Google and Amazon who are like part of Project Nimbus,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   and you see Indivision developing all of this like metric
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.420]   and surveillance and all of that stuff,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.700]   and then you have like something like the gospel
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.820]   that like people have actually said
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.060]   that the gospel can actually create a target list
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.540]   using AI and give you a green, yellow, or a red
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.420]   to go ahead, and now AI is not just disrupting the market,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.260]   it's disrupting our humanity, and it is,
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.020]   we became so comfortable killing people from afar,
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.420]   killing people with a push of the button,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.940]   and now it is like, it's like dating apps,
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.340]   you know, when you swipe left and right,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.060]   and it's like, oh, right, it becomes so like cheap.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.180]   It's not like meeting someone.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.740]   It's like, ah, it's like a lot of fish in the sea.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.380]   Same with AI, boom, 500 people killed, boom, they killed.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.020]   It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.500]   and then it's so far removed from you,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.540]   so when you put these people in this condition,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.940]   you have literally put them
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.700]   in a different universe than yours.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.540]   You are behind in your air-conditioned screens
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.940]   like pushing them, blowing up a university.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.860]   It's amazing, but then you meet what you have done,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.420]   that you meet the Frankenstein that you have created,
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.420]   and then people are like, oh, look what they did to us.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.260]   - You just gave me this image of a dating app from hell
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.620]   where leaders are just sitting there
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.300]   and kind of swiping left and right.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.180]   - Invade, destroy.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.020]   - It's boring, right?
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.260]   - Like a puppet government.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.340]   - Yeah, and then turn off the phone, go to sleep.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.300]   So I got, you know, I traveled to the West Bank
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.700]   and I mentioned to you offline
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.620]   that I really loved the people there.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.660]   Just, you know, I've met a bunch of people like that
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.540]   in Eastern Europe where I grew up.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.100]   Yeah, like the flamboyant,
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.940]   the big personalities, all of that.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:49.060]   I also met a person who's in charge of a refugee camp
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.060]   who was shop an IDF soldier.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:58.420]   And I'm not sure the words he said are important
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.700]   as the consequences of the thing that you mentioned,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.820]   which is the deep hate in his eyes.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.660]   That didn't feel repairable at all.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.900]   It was pain, it was like a foundation of pain
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.820]   and on top of that, a hatred.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.420]   And I was like, wow, this is what,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.940]   you kill one person, that's the way you create.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:24.180]   Because we have kind of like a front row seat
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.700]   to what's happening.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.300]   We think we're in it, but we can't really grasp it.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.540]   I mean, people's like, oh, we're just gonna go in,
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.820]   get Hamas out, and we're gonna get them back in.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.220]   And not only the people get back in,
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.900]   how do you think they would look at you?
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.020]   What have you created?
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.940]   What have you done?
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.380]   My show in Egypt was all about propaganda.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.180]   It's all about the use of words.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.020]   Words are very important.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.860]   The decapitated babies were not chosen randomly
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:00.060]   because you see, it plants a certain image in your brain.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   Imagine if you're going in, what a baby can do?
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.580]   It can smile, cry, and poop, that's it.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.460]   It's absolutely no threat.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.300]   So when you tell people 40 decapitated babies,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   they are so animalistic, they didn't see the babies.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.260]   Women raped, of course he's an animal to do that.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.260]   And they would go through that, and they would,
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.540]   what was very frustrating about the conversation
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.820]   is the gish galloping, the gish galloping,
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.900]   throwing, you see the distractions?
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.740]   You see what happens?
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.580]   It's like, what's the proportion response?
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.980]   Can Israel defend itself?
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.140]   Do you condemn Hamas?
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.540]   Does Israel has the right to exist?
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.780]   Decapitated babies, raped women.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.780]   Why don't the Arab countries take them?
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.340]   Why don't the Muslims kill Muslims?
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.220]   Look what happened in Yemen, in Syria, in Iraq.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.420]   See how they kind of distract you?
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.260]   They throw little things at you.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.500]   So you don't know what to do?
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.740]   Oh, the UN, anti-Semitic, October 7th,
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.140]   October 7th, October 7th.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.500]   And then suddenly you are distracted
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.180]   and pulled into discussing all of these little things.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.140]   And you're not discussing what's happening right now.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.460]   It is basically stalling,
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.900]   giving them time to do what they do.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.220]   - So there's some degree to the propaganda,
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.260]   so the beheaded babies and all this kind of stuff,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.500]   that is so over the top
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.660]   that it shuts down actual conversation
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.260]   about actual wrongs, war crimes on both sides.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.780]   So it's overstating it to where everyone on social media
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.820]   and everywhere in the press and everywhere is arguing,
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.420]   almost become desensitized to actual horrors of death,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.860]   which are more mundane.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.900]   They're not so dramatic as beheaded babies.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.540]   - Because people, a baby is shot, but decapitated babies.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.140]   There's like a knife blade that goes into the skin,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.780]   the trachea, the flesh, the spine.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.180]   Decapitated, you can just like, he's dead.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.100]   No, you go in, this is the hate, so much hate.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.940]   And you know, that's why--
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.420]   - You have made me laugh.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.660]   (laughing)
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.820]   At the darkest shit.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.460]   You're such a beautiful person.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.860]   Your dark humor is just wonderful.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.540]   - But you see, this happened to Jews before.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.660]   Remember blood libel?
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.980]   Where did the blood libel come from?
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:10.460]   It come from these rumors that Jews suck baby's blood.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.300]   This is what they did to them.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.340]   - That's what's in the cup.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.300]   (laughing)
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.700]   - That's a very delicious baby cup.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.660]   - Delicious baby blood.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.500]   - But this is what you do.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.220]   You tell people something,
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.700]   and it happened with the Native Americans
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.100]   when they were here, when they went in
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.900]   and they wipe a whole tribe.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.220]   So, and Jewish people, one of the minorities
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.020]   that were persecuted and had this used against them
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.140]   for a very long time, and it is terrible,
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.340]   and it's terrifying that it's been used again.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.580]   - So I just did a very lengthy debate
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.940]   on Israel and Palestine.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.580]   And the really painful thing from that,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.740]   those two historians, it was deep, it was thorough,
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   it was fascinating, but in constantly asking
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.220]   about sources of hope or solutions, there was none.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:00.340]   There was a sense of, like a really dark sense
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.340]   of it's hopeless, from both sides, it's hopeless.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.300]   So, you know, I look to you.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.660]   (laughing)
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.660]   For a source of, for a source of hope.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.980]   Do you have, is there any hope here,
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.140]   solutions, short-term, long-term?
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.180]   - Obama have kind of summarized this beautifully
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.380]   in his book.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.820]   He said, the reason why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.620]   is so chronic is one side has so much power,
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.820]   and the other side have absolutely no power.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.620]   And that's what Obama would say.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.060]   He said, like, you have Israel
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.380]   that basically don't listen to us,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.860]   because they are supported by people
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.980]   who are bigger than the president,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.820]   bigger than the administration.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.660]   They know that they can.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.300]   I mean, like Netanyahu was caught on tape many times
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.900]   saying, like, he's basically like belittling Americans.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.500]   Like, we control 80% of the population.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.580]   We don't care.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.660]   This has kind of like nonchalant,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.380]   kind of like, oh, we have them.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.460]   And there's nothing really that compels Israel
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.060]   to give up anything, because at the end of the day,
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.900]   what is compromise?
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.140]   Compromise is like, I give something, you give something.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.020]   Israel's not giving anything.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.420]   And they project that on you.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.260]   So, for example, how many times have we heard,
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.340]   like, oh, Palestinians were giving like four, five,
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.020]   six, seven, 15 chances, and they said no to them.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.580]   And yet, when you read the history,
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.460]   that's not the case at all.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.220]   Like, for example, in 2000,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.060]   the whole idea about like Arafat walked away from Oslo.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.900]   That didn't happen.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.420]   And there is an incredible video by, you know,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.020]   what's his name, Joe Skorborow with Misha.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.860]   And they were hosting her father, Brzezinski.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.140]   He was the national security advisor.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.260]   And Joe Skorborow said, like, well, you know,
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.700]   like, Arafat left the Oslo Accord and the Palestinians left.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.580]   And then Brzezinski said, like,
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.740]   this is like embarrassingly shallow.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.660]   It's like, listen, what happened was,
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.820]   there was a lot of catches on the Oslo Accord.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.420]   It was very unfair to the Palestinians.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.940]   So, Arafat said, like, I agree,
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.460]   but I need to take it to the Arab capitals.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.980]   And they went to Sharm el-Sheikh.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.180]   They came to Egypt.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.020]   And he and Ehud Barak went to there.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.340]   And then Ehud Barak left because there was election,
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.220]   and he lost the election, came, and it was destroyed.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.580]   This is one of the reason why people,
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.540]   it's kind of like facts don't matter
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.140]   as much as what is the narrative that has been controlled.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.020]   - But what were the biggest barriers to peace there?
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.620]   Do you think it's fundamentally,
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.300]   leaders don't want a two-state solution?
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.780]   Or was there nuanced small differences
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.980]   that if solved could have led to a two-state solution?
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.180]   - I mean, maybe there was a certain point
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.180]   when the Israeli leaders were more open to compromise.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.220]   But I can't say that
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.860]   because each time Israel gives back land,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.620]   it has to be after some use of force.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   The 1973 war, the Intifada, the first and second,
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.500]   the casualties in Gaza,
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.100]   they never give up land willingly and because of peace.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.620]   Because if I have that much military,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.940]   I can do whatever I want.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.420]   Why would I give up anything?
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.460]   I have that much power.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.300]   Why would America or China give everything
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.140]   if they're so powerful?
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.180]   And especially if they have this kind of open check
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.460]   from the United States.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.700]   So it is really about
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.980]   what can push Israel to give up something?
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.340]   Because you are so much stronger than me.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.620]   What could compel you to give up something?
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.580]   And this is why the whole thing
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.660]   about trying to equalize Palestinians
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.420]   and the Israeli state and government,
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.500]   it doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.700]   - So what is the source of hope?
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.100]   You know, Jon Stewart,
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.980]   who will talk about it from many angles,
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.920]   somebody you admire, a friend,
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.940]   he proposed a two-state solution.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.860]   - Of course.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.860]   - Look to the comedians for hope.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.140]   - Yes, well, everybody's talking
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.300]   about the two-state solution,
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.660]   but Israel has said many times on Netanyahu and Bennis,
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.580]   like, there is gonna be no state solutions.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.980]   In the past, it's like, even Naftali Bennett,
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.700]   he came in on the hard talk.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.780]   It's like, yeah, maybe in the past
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.880]   we wanted two-state solutions,
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.900]   but like, look, every time we give them land, they kill us.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.060]   So no state solutions.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.700]   And they are openly saying it.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.620]   - That's perhaps rhetoric.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.220]   - Rhetoric that is supported by action.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.660]   Because look at what they're doing
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.100]   in the West Bank that you said.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.100]   They are cutting it, illegal settlement, piecemealing it.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.620]   So how, if you have an intention at all
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.660]   to give them anything, why do you keep doing this?
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.620]   - And you've called it a bunch of little Gazas.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.460]   - It's a nice little picture of what's happening.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.020]   - Piecemealing it, dum, dum, dum.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.520]   Because it is, what happened in the past four months,
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.660]   the Palestinians have been microdosing on it
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.660]   for a very long time, little by little, little by little.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.660]   And we would shout every time when it gets too much,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.580]   and then we shut down, and then little by little.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.660]   But this time it was hard.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.420]   It was hard to see the blatant oppression.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.380]   And the world said, maybe the Hamas Ministry of Health
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.620]   are giving us the bad numbers.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.180]   Maybe it's just human shields.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.340]   And I laugh, there's 13,000 babies killed.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.820]   Does that mean that there are 13,000 military targets
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.620]   hiding in their diapers?
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.700]   Because it is so, it doesn't make any sense
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.900]   to kill that many babies.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.940]   It's like, oh, oops, it is out of our hands.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.180]   - It's hard to know what to do with those numbers.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.180]   I mean, it's just one baby is enough.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.860]   - But you know what happens?
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.620]   When you hear so many numbers, numbers become numbers.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.180]   And you become so desensitized.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.700]   And this is why there's a difference
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.100]   between saying, 13,000 Palestinian kids dead.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.660]   It's like Mila Cohen, an Israeli baby, 10 months old.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.380]   She was killed in her crib.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.940]   And this is what we hear from CNN.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.920]   We never hear a story about a Palestinian kid.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.420]   That's why, thank you for giving me the space
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.900]   for saying the news of the Palestinian children
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.700]   that were killed just in four weeks.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:27.180]   Because humans needs context, they need depth.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.100]   They need like a 3D look at what they can look at.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.620]   But if you just tell them numbers,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.460]   they don't mean anything.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.060]   - Is there some degree to where both leaderships,
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.460]   Hamas, PA, Palestinian Authority, Israel,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.460]   all want war, like perpetual war to remain in power?
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.380]   - There is, that's an interesting question.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.980]   But I mean, let's admit something.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.100]   The Arab regimes in the area have actually used
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.380]   the problem of Palestine in order to stay in power,
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.580]   in order to get excuses to like have this enemy.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.820]   And Israel, the Israeli government has used that too,
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.340]   and maybe the Palestinians.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.220]   But my problem with when going into discussion,
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.140]   this is that the two sides are not equal.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.380]   They're not equal in power.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.700]   They're not equal in influence,
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.900]   and they're not equal in international support,
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.380]   especially with the United States.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.380]   So Palestinians can, people who have made changes
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.660]   in history were the people with power,
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.940]   the people who would have the ability to change things.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.100]   And the Palestinians cannot really change,
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.220]   and what can they change?
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.980]   - Well, is that true though?
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.900]   - Okay. - With how much support
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.140]   the Palestinian people have?
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.220]   So just like you said, there's a lot of Arab states
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:54.020]   that will voice their pro-Palestinian position
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.100]   in order to distract from the young corruption
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.380]   and abuses of power in their own countries.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.420]   But I don't think if you look globally,
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.540]   there's a complete asymmetry of power
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.620]   and public opinion here, maybe in the West.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.980]   But if you look globally--
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.820]   - But do they have the same kind of weapons
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.660]   that the Israeli have?
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.100]   - So literally power?
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.220]   No, there's a major asymmetry of literal power.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.680]   - Some money to their leaders?
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.420]   Does that make any difference?
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.660]   I mean, and also when you say Palestinian authority,
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.900]   which authority are you talking about?
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.780]   Hamas or the Palestinian authority
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.740]   who has been kind of a domesticated,
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.580]   kind of like a puppy for the Palestinians,
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.260]   who basically have been an informant on their own people.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.460]   And this is the thing also that kind of like
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.540]   really pissed me off when I was hearing the thing
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.980]   about Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.060]   We have Netanyahu on tape confessing
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.220]   that he supported Hamas, gave him money in order
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.300]   to cause factions between the Palestinians.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.700]   So it's just like, you just told me this.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.780]   You just told me Netanyahu supports Hamas.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.420]   But Hamas is like, what?
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.220]   - I mean, to which degree does Netanyahu
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:08.220]   represent the Israeli people is a real question.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.060]   - To which point does Trump or Biden
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.660]   represent the American people?
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.020]   - And to which degree does Hamas
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.460]   represent the Palestinian people?
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.180]   - Does, none of these represent it,
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.780]   but who have the power in order to make the decisions?
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.940]   It really comes down to that.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.740]   - Well, who does have the power?
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.980]   - You're giving a lot of power to Israel.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.820]   - Yeah.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.220]   - But the Arab League--
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.340]   - What should Hamas do?
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.780]   What do you think we should Hamas do?
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.500]   - Continue doing what a charter says,
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.620]   which is trying to destroy Israel.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.660]   And the role of the Palestinian people
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.340]   is to overthrow Hamas and get a more
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.060]   moderate leadership probably.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.300]   And the role of the Israeli people
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   is to vote out this right-wing government
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.860]   and elect a more moderate leader
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.060]   so that there's a chance at peace
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.740]   with two moderate leaders.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.420]   - So before Hamas even got to control 2006 Gaza,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.260]   there was Eriel Sharon in 2000.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.660]   And we all know what happened.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.980]   And Ariel Sharon kind of like had made,
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.620]   came up with this amazing policy
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.620]   of like breaking people's kids' bones in the Intifada.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.020]   So Hill Baraki was also like, I mean,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.140]   which one is moderate?
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.900]   I mean, I think is Hamas is a product of what happened.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.900]   I mean, we can, if there was no apartheid in South Africa,
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.700]   there would be no NFC.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.140]   There would be no Nelson Mandela.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.020]   If there were no Nazis in Paris,
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.820]   there would be no French resistance.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.820]   And I'm not saying, and again, I'm not,
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.620]   I don't wanna be put in a position
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.900]   to defend Hamas or anybody
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.540]   because you know what that entails.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.540]   But those are like Hamas, again, not defending them.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.340]   They went into October 7th.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.100]   What was their, why did they did that?
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.380]   Like release our hostages, the people in prison.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.460]   Because if you're talking about people who were kidnapped,
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.500]   Israel kidnaps people every single day.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.820]   And when they had the first exchange in November 4th,
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.020]   Israelis, 400 people,
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.460]   three quarters of them were women and children.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.500]   Why are those people in prison?
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.340]   There's one in four kids that are in prison
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.300]   that stay in solitary confinement,
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.700]   which is by international law, a form of torture.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.580]   And you're putting kids through that.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.820]   - Is it possible, so first of all, ceasefire.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.660]   - Yes.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.620]   - And longer term, is it possible for Arab states
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.540]   and the United States to get together
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:38.540]   and with power through diplomacy enforce a solution?
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:44.620]   - It's a very, very ideal solution.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.740]   But you know, and I know that Arab states
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.140]   don't really have the power.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.220]   All of the powers are in the hands of America.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.180]   - They have the power.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.100]   See, I would, I think they have the power.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.940]   I don't--
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.060]   - Maybe they don't want to use it.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.720]   - They don't want, well, that's--
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.560]   - Maybe they don't want to use it.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.260]   - Because there's a benefit, like the dark,
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.660]   the dark sense I have is that a lot of people
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.580]   win from the suffering that Palestinians are going through
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.260]   because they can point to that and distract from--
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.340]   - Definitely, definitely.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.460]   - Corruption in their own states.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.860]   And then obviously Iran can benefit also
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.020]   from the same kind of dynamic,
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:26.020]   distracting from the authoritarian nature of their regime.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.760]   - Definitely, but what is the core of the problem here?
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.820]   Is it the Arab states using the suffering
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.060]   or actually the suffering itself?
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.220]   And the suffering comes from people being displaced,
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.960]   their homes were taken away.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.340]   There are seven million Palestinians in diaspora.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.360]   Seven millions, seven million went out there
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.940]   and now they're living in Canada and America and Europe.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.240]   They had homes there, they cannot go back to.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.820]   1.7 million people of the people in Gaza
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.920]   don't belong in Gaza, they were pushed from other places.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.900]   The piecemeal thing of people are being,
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.900]   you know, in Germany, I'm gonna shift gear a little bit,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.140]   it's gonna be a little bit of fun.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.020]   There is a book that I bought the rights to
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.020]   and I want to turn it into a movie.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.460]   And I bought, I optioned the right for two years
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.720]   in March of last year, before October 7th.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.120]   After October 7th, I bought the permanent right.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.580]   That book is called "The Muslim and the Jew"
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.120]   and it is written by an author called Ronin Steinke.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.580]   I read an article about this book in 2016
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.140]   and I chased that book for rights for seven years.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.980]   I didn't have that much money, but I wanted that book.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.180]   And that book was translated into English
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.020]   called "Anna and Dr. Halmy."
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.540]   And that book tells the incredible story
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   under Nazi Germany, where Arabs went in droves
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.820]   to Berlin in 1920s after the First World War
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.780]   in the Weimar Republic and they became doctors
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.860]   and engineers and journalists for two reasons.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.460]   Number one, it was dirt cheap,
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.060]   very cheap because of the inflation.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.060]   And two, a lot of the Arab nationalists
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:16.000]   didn't want to send their kids to England or France
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.600]   because they were the occupiers.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.220]   And Dr. Halmy was the hero of that.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.660]   He's an Egyptian doctor and that's why I kind of like,
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.820]   I personally kind of connected with him.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.820]   And he went to medical school, didn't find a place to live,
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.940]   so he lived in the Jewish ghettos, like many Arabs.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.900]   He didn't find a school to work, a hospital to work in,
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.660]   so he worked in a Jewish hospital.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.220]   So there was a lot of Arabs who lived with the ghetto.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.800]   And actually the first director of the Berlin Mosque
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.020]   was a Jewish convert who converted to Islam
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.260]   and he was a gay activist.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.900]   I'm telling you, this is like a crazy story.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.940]   And this is not a fiction story.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.060]   This is actually like a nonfiction.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.300]   It's written actually based on the statement
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.340]   and the documents of the Nazis and the Gestapo.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:10.340]   Dr. Halmy, he was in this hospital and the Nazis came in
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:16.540]   and they killed and tortured and beat up the Jewish doctor
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.260]   and they made him the head of his department.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.180]   Then he was, so now he's surrounded by Nazi doctor.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.220]   They didn't touch him because he was an Arab.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.140]   There was kind of like a thing between Germany
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.440]   and the Arabs because they wanted to appease to them
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   in order to have kind of a grassroots base
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.300]   in the Arab world where he want to go next.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:43.140]   And this is why 1934, 1935, the racial laws of Nuremberg,
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:46.700]   they had a name change.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.940]   First they were called anti-Semitic.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.460]   Then they changed into anti-Jewish
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.740]   because also Arabs were Semitic.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.340]   So they wanted to appease the Arabs.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.380]   Now, what happened to Dr. Halmy when that happened to him?
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.900]   He would go back to the ghetto
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.580]   and he would see the apartments next to him,
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.740]   the Jewish apartment, become more and more and more
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.220]   flooded with people because they were moving Jews
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.340]   and pushing them and putting them together,
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.620]   pushing them to the side.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.620]   And each flat, each apartment, instead of one family,
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.180]   it would have three, four, six, seven families.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.100]   And he was there going into a home and he looked.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.140]   He was there.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.420]   This is where the people he grew up with, he lived with.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.260]   And now he's seen that kind of discrimination
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.460]   just because he was an Arab.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.460]   And then he started to kind of atone for,
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.220]   because he felt responsible
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.700]   because he wasn't treated the same way.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.060]   And he started to go and treat Jewish people in their homes
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.340]   because they couldn't go to hospitals.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.800]   And then one family gave them his daughter.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.180]   It's like, this is Anna, save her.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.460]   He took her, pretended that she's his niece,
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.900]   put a hijab around her, taught her Arabic,
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.840]   called her Nadia, my daughter's name, by the way.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.140]   And he hid her in plain sights for seven years
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.380]   in front of the Nazis as his nurse.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.500]   It's an incredible story.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.020]   And then not just that he went to prison
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.500]   and then he went out and he formed with the Arab people
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.500]   that was in prison with him a network that saves 300 Jews.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.100]   See that kind of story?
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.620]   This is the Jews that were living in the Arab world.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.020]   I'm not saying that the Jews living in the Arab world
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.380]   was living like an incredible life.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.860]   Of course, as a kind of a minority,
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.860]   they did not have the full power or the full advantages
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.620]   of the rule, that's normal.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.620]   But we had this kind of a relationship
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:47.460]   before Israel was erected in 1948.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.020]   And then, of course, everybody looked at Jews
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.060]   at that time as fifth column.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.660]   And of course, the nationalistic regimes used that.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.620]   And this is why what Biden said was very dangerous
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.180]   when he said, "If there is no Israel,
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.700]   "no Jew in the world will feel safe.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.340]   "You are the leader of the free world.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.820]   "You are the president of the United States.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.040]   "Do you mean that you are telling me
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.840]   "that the Jews in your country,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.720]   "in the United States of America are not safe?
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.900]   "That is wrong on two levels.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.020]   "Number one, America historically and right now
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.500]   "is more safe to Jews in the world than anybody.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.120]   "They are safer than the Jews in Israel.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.160]   "They never had pogroms or the Holocaust like Europe.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.260]   "They live here a good life.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.800]   "Not perfect life, but they are better.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.260]   "Second of all, if you're the president
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.680]   "and you're telling that a group of people
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.800]   "will not feel safe unless there is a different one,
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.880]   "you are already feeding into their fifth column.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.300]   "They're like, you're Russian, you come from there.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.060]   "And there is a group of laws in the Russian Constitution
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.260]   "that says that Russia will protect its citizens
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.500]   "everywhere in the world.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.120]   "What happens if the president says like,
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.140]   "oh, you're Russians, you're protected by your own country,
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:50.980]   "you don't belong here?
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.060]   "This is terrible."
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.660]   - Yeah, you're right, that's actually an indirect threat.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.660]   It's like even saying Muslims cannot feel safe in America
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.100]   or something like this.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.060]   That means like that's a threat.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.400]   - But what would a Jewish person in Beverly Hills
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.160]   or in Brooklyn feel if he hears that?
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.000]   You are already telling people
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.760]   you need to be loyal to Israel.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.880]   I mean, Israel is a foreign country.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.760]   I am sorry, but Israel is a foreign country.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.400]   Israel is a client country that we sponsor
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.780]   and it should actually be responsible
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.240]   and held accountable for what they do.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   - You mentioned 1948, the Nakba,
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   but before that, '41, '39, '41 to '45, the Holocaust.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.060]   What do you do?
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.760]   What do you do with the Holocaust?
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.640]   How do you incorporate into the calculus
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   of what's-- - Oh, it's terrible.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.020]   - Of morality that leads up to the displacement
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:55.020]   of 700,000 Palestinians from the land?
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.340]   How do you work that out?
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.240]   - It is terrible, but like, I mean,
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.920]   what the systemic annihilation of Jewish people
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   under the Nazi, that is like a carefully engineered,
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.140]   thought for, planned, it was terrible.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   It was like kind of like the human ingenuity
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.720]   put into like something that is very evil.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.620]   But also, it is not just that happened.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.840]   We need to remember that Otto Frank,
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.860]   the father of Anna Frank, has his visa,
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.380]   refugee visa rejected by the United States.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.940]   There's a lot of people that were rejected
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.860]   by the United States, rejected by other European countries,
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.780]   and then they were pushed into Palestine.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.780]   So you have to put yourself between like,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.420]   and the Arabs, okay, we're sitting here,
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.220]   okay, come, and then, all right,
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.900]   you don't have a home or a country anymore.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.700]   That kills you.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.100]   I mean, you see, if I'm not an Arab
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.020]   and you give me that kind of piece
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.580]   of like terrible human treasure,
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.300]   like, oh my God, that is terrible.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.460]   But then I'm an Arab, it's like, yes, I'm so sorry,
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.580]   but what do I have to do with that?
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.020]   Why is that my fault?
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.060]   The persecution of the Jewish people
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.660]   have started since the eighth and ninth century
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.900]   because they were like, they were first anti-Christians.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.640]   They were like criminal immigrants.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.180]   They were like conspirators.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.940]   This is the antis, like people kind of like,
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.940]   it's as if Europe kind of like throw antisemitism on us.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.260]   You understand that like Henry Ford,
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.100]   Henry Ford is one of the biggest anti,
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.520]   he was the inspiration for Adolf Hitler.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.380]   (laughs)
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:32.900]   This is how antisemitic Henry Ford was.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.900]   And you kind of like gloss over that.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.260]   And then suddenly we as Arabs have to pay the price.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.100]   Why?
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.340]   - Several questions I wanna ask there.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.260]   So, but one, just zooming out,
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.100]   why do you think hatred of Jews
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:54.820]   has been such a viral kind of idea
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.740]   throughout human history?
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.140]   - Oh, it's very easy.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.740]   It all started from Christ.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.340]   They killed Christ, they killed Christ, they killed Christ.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.400]   They're the killer of Christ.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.380]   - That's a very sexy story.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.420]   - That was so, yeah, that was, and that stayed for years.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.300]   That stayed for centuries, I'm sorry, centuries.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.500]   They're the killer of Christ.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:16.580]   And then the Catholic Church did not allow usury,
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.300]   but they would work in usury.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.100]   So they become rich.
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.540]   Now the people that we hate,
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.660]   that we accuse them of killing Christ are becoming rich.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.940]   So that's envy now.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.140]   And that's hatred.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:32.540]   I mean, when you talk about ghettos,
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.260]   ghettos was not just a secluded parts in cities.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.980]   Sometimes those ghettos were outside the cities.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.900]   Jews were not even allowed to work a lot of professions.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.780]   They were not allowed to get into the syndicates
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.940]   of certain professions.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.900]   So they had to go work usury and they got rich.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.660]   So the people hated them more.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:57.580]   The first crusade didn't kill a single Muslim.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.460]   All they killed were Jews.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.500]   And when they finally arrived to Jerusalem,
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.460]   all they killed were Jews.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.600]   They almost annihilated the Jews.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.020]   So it was all this.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.940]   And of course you have the dark ages.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.500]   Who do you need as an enemy?
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.940]   The Jews, all right?
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:12.940]   They're the killer of Christ.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.760]   There's nothing bigger than this.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.140]   And then you fast forward.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.380]   I mean, one of the things that I found out
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.300]   that was very, very, very, very crazy
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:28.940]   when Henry Ford imported the protocols
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.900]   of the elders of Zion.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.260]   By the way, in the Arab world,
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.940]   protocols of the elders of Zion is so popular.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.940]   And for obvious reasons.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.460]   And for the people who don't know,
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.820]   it's kind of like a bunch of stories.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.340]   And basically it's like the Jews saying,
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.580]   like, "We gotta control the war.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.420]   "Then we're gonna do this,
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.220]   "then we're gonna do that," and whatever.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.420]   What people don't know,
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.220]   that that is a work of plagiarism.
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:59.220]   It was plagiarized from a satirical play
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.820]   called "Conversation in Hell"
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.140]   between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.500]   And it is kind of like based on one chapter
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.900]   or one scene or something.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.740]   It's crazy.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.660]   - But it's crazy how sticky it is.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.500]   - Yes.
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.340]   - That's weird. - Yes.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.820]   Because if I hate you, that's great.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.060]   But if I have a story to support that hate,
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.900]   that's even better.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.260]   - But it's like one of the best stories,
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.380]   one of the stickiest stories about hate.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.220]   - Of course.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.060]   - It's probably the most effective
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:34.060]   'cause a lot of peoples hate other groups of peoples,
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.060]   but that's just like the sexiest story of them all.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:42.060]   - Because humans need to concentrate their hate,
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.780]   their insecurities, and their shortcomings
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.460]   into one thing that they can practice that hate on.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.900]   If it's a person, great.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.100]   If it's a group, even better.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.940]   - But how do you, into this calculus,
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.580]   incorporate that that group is pretty small?
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.940]   There's 16 million Jews worldwide.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.540]   And you mentioned how is that the responsibility
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.180]   of the Arab peoples?
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.820]   Everybody should be to blame for not taking in Jews
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.060]   after the Holocaust.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.060]   But the reality of the situation,
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.880]   if we look at the religious slice of this,
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.820]   there's 16, let's say, million Jews,
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.660]   and there's, I don't know how many Muslims,
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.100]   but 1.8 billion?
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:27.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.500]   - That difference, that 100x difference,
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.060]   do you incorporate that into the sense
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:42.060]   that Jews in Israel might feel for the existential dread
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:47.660]   that we might, this small group might be destroyed?
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.140]   - Jews in Israel have every right to feel afraid
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.740]   because of everything that they see
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.460]   and everything they've been told, everything.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.980]   But I would say that the calculus or the numbers
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:01.900]   doesn't, like, of course, like being small,
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.940]   it is, of course, a factor,
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.500]   but it is never an excuse in order to take something
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.820]   that's not yours.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.420]   It's saying like, hey, you have 300 million Americans,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.140]   and we have 52, 50, so it says give one state for another,
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.300]   there's too many of them, too many of you,
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.540]   just give them something, you know?
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.700]   It's like the fact that I have something and you don't,
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.400]   and there's too many of me and there is little of you,
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.460]   and then you come in, and it's not really,
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.260]   Israel against the Arab world or the Muslim world
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.180]   because we have to say, we fucked up big time.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.260]   But it is the Palestinians that are in,
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.900]   and they are being subjected to that.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.100]   So it's not really like the 1.8 billion
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.300]   and the 16 million Jews.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.100]   And the 1.8 billion, if you look at them,
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.540]   some of them, like, don't care,
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.820]   some of them live into regimes that being oppressed,
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.420]   and those regimes are supported
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.860]   by the United States in order.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.400]   It's easier for me as an empire
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.600]   to take what I want from this country
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.460]   if I control the dictator.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.300]   And I tell them that his power
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.980]   is linked to my ability, to my desire to keep him in power.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.940]   So that's why you have a total disconnect
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.420]   between people in power in the Arab and the Muslim countries
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.380]   and the people themselves.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.660]   - Can you speak to 1948, you know,
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.220]   'cause you mentioned taking land that's not yours,
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.500]   maybe parallels with Native Americans.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.300]   - Yeah.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.460]   - There was a war.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:34.340]   The Jewish minority fought that war
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.560]   against several Arab states and won that war.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.120]   How do we incorporate that into the Catholics?
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.300]   - Yeah, well, that's also a misconception,
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:45.900]   like a misinterpretation of the event
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.900]   because it seems that it was, like,
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.900]   a small, it's kind of like a David and Goliath
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.800]   kind of story.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.720]   But, and I was always like, how did we not do that?
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.100]   But in reality, with numbers,
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.940]   I can't pull it up right now,
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.180]   but if you look at the numbers,
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.660]   the number of tanks, the planes,
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:11.940]   the trained officer, because those,
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:15.500]   many of those Jewish fighters came from World War II.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.380]   They were seasoned fighters.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:22.340]   And they actually had more planes,
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.140]   more tanks, more artillery, more pieces of weapon,
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.620]   more of the all of the other combined
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:31.220]   because the people that really, like, fought was Egypt.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.340]   And you have to, in 1948, many of those Arab countries
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.480]   didn't even have their independence.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.660]   So they would kind of, like, send, like, a cavalry
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.460]   or, like, a people in horses.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.340]   But in fact, the whole idea was, like,
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.260]   we won against seven nations.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.340]   The numbers were totally in Israel's favor.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.460]   They were better equipped.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.780]   They were better trained.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:53.780]   They had, like, more tanks and artillery and aeroplanes.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.800]   And they planned better.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.780]   So yes, they deserved the win
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.620]   because they planned and we did it.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.140]   - So to you, there was an asymmetry in military power
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.300]   even then. - Yeah.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:06.600]   - But what do you do with the fact that the war was won?
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.100]   So, like, if you look at the history of the world,
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:15.820]   there is wars fought over land.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.660]   I agree with you.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.420]   This has been the history of humanity.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.260]   Humanity was not living peacefully.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.020]   It's all about, like, people taking people
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.780]   and killing people, taking their land.
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.840]   But there's two difference here.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.840]   Mostly, usually, the conquering power,
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.000]   like, for example, England.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.380]   They had England and they conquer you in India.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.980]   And after the occupation finished, they go back to England.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:43.460]   France, Greece, Persia, Egypt, they were, like,
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.220]   go and expand and shrink, expand and shrink.
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:47.580]   It's all been there.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.820]   What is different here is exactly what happened
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.040]   in Australia and the United States.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.940]   A group of people came in, not just to conquer
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:58.380]   and take the land, but to completely change,
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.480]   to replace them and get them out or kill them.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.800]   It was very easy with the Indians
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.220]   because they had smallpox, there was no social media,
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.380]   they did it over 400 years, they had time.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.120]   The problem is, what is happening right now,
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.220]   I agree with you, it might not be that new,
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.540]   but we are there and we're watching it happen.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.860]   - And so now we have to confront the realities
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.180]   of war and empire and conquering.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.420]   - Because you know what's the problem?
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.660]   We told ourselves we can be better.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.500]   - Yeah.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.500]   - After 1948, there was the Universal Declaration
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.140]   of Human Rights.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.500]   It means that we are gonna be better humans.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.380]   We're not gonna kill and take land,
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.540]   we're not gonna displace people,
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.360]   we're not gonna take people for what they are.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.460]   There's now laws, there's international laws,
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.620]   international court of justice.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.940]   And now Israel is giving the middle finger to all of them.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.540]   - So isn't in some fundamental way,
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.280]   this whole thing that we're talking about
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.620]   is us as a civilization on social media,
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:57.620]   in articles and books, in newspapers,
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.500]   we're just trying to figure out who are we as a people.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.100]   - I think that the shock came from the fact
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.740]   that we thought that we as humanity have evolved
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:11.780]   and now we are, what have actually changed
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.460]   is that we became more advanced
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.940]   in effectively eradicating a group of people
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.980]   because of the technology that we have.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:19.540]   And the fact that we can do that
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.660]   under the eyes and ears of all the world
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:23.660]   and we are watching it under a phone,
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.180]   we have a window, we have a window to the war.
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:29.380]   You know, 1945, people didn't know what was happening
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.140]   in Japan, well, we heard about it on the radio.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.740]   Like, oh, today our forces came in
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.200]   and they launched, I don't know.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.160]   We don't know, we heard it.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.060]   We maybe saw pictures after that and it's quite edited.
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.580]   But now we see it, we're into it.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:47.580]   And it is so much for our psyche and we can get it.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.820]   And it's like, and the Arabs are saying like,
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.340]   guys, you told us we came to the West
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.860]   because we were told that we were equal.
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.920]   You know the university declaration, right?
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.340]   One of the co-authors, his name is Stefan Hessel.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.580]   He's a Jew, he is a survivor of the Holocaust.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.240]   And you know what happened to him?
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.620]   He died, by the way, a couple of years ago.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.700]   But he, before he died, he was canceled by so many people
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.960]   and he was called antisemitic.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.640]   Because he joined the BDS movement
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.520]   and he spoke of Palestine.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.600]   That is the author of the universal declaration
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.000]   of human rights that we value so much
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.760]   and we think that that would define our humanity.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.160]   But then we go in and we are shocked.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.800]   It's like, maybe we were sold something.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.320]   Maybe that was false advertisement.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.160]   - You shared a tweet by an account called Awesome Jew.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.760]   (laughing)
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.760]   It reads, "Islamo-Nazi comedian Bassem Yusuf."
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.560]   Comedian in quotes, by the way.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, because I'm not funny.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.200]   - So Islamo-Nazi comedian Bassem Yusuf is now denying,
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.060]   I love that you retweeted this like twice.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.200]   - Yeah.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.300]   - I guess, because it's advertising some upcoming dates.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:10.700]   He's now denying October 7th massacre.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.000]   The Muslim radical Bassem Yusuf is notorious
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   for his radical, radical, said twice,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.360]   for his radical hatred of Jews and Israel.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.900]   In a recent clip, he claims that the atrocities
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.240]   committed on October 7th are fabricated
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.440]   or are looking for all information regarding
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.480]   any of his upcoming shows, as well as the venues
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.640]   which host the scumbag would Jews feel safe
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.800]   around this Nazi, Nazi.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.940]   - Yeah.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.200]   - I've never, this is my first time interviewing a Nazi.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.880]   - You know, it's my first time I actually get called a Nazi.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.720]   - First time.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   - First time, I have been called so many things in Egypt.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   So in Egypt, I was called a CIA operative
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.600]   a Mossad spy, secret Muslim brotherhood,
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.440]   a secret Jew, secret Jew.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.120]   There was also an article that was published about me
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.080]   in the state-run media saying in details
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   how Bassem has been recruited by CIA agents
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.560]   using Jon Stewart in order to use satire
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.080]   to bring down the country.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.960]   I was a Freemason, an infidel.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:22.240]   A member of the Knights of the Temple,
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.520]   something like that.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.240]   And there's actually people, the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.480]   on their show, they would say like,
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.240]   he is actually an Israeli and they have forged
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.320]   an Egyptian ID for him to come.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.640]   So it's kind of like when I get,
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.500]   I said, I had, I left all of that behind
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.880]   and I come here, it's like, boom, anti-Semitic Nazi, damn.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.280]   I mean, I really covered everything.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.320]   I don't know what else.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.000]   I mean, I think I have, it's kind of like
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.920]   I'm collecting PhDs.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.000]   I'm just like getting like all of these credits.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.840]   - How do you deal with that?
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.440]   How do you deal with the attacks?
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.120]   I mean, this goes back to the decision
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.640]   to do the interview with Piers Morgan.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.440]   Like how do you like psychologically do all of it?
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.680]   - These kind of attacks, at the beginning, it's fun.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.120]   But when they evolve into something else,
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.520]   so for example, I was like laughing
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.200]   of all of the stuff about calling me this,
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.400]   calling me that, but then when people would come
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.960]   and thread the feature, because it's not the people
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.880]   who are making those accusations that would come to you.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.160]   It's the people that will hear
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.040]   and see those accusations and act on it.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.000]   And there's always the fear of like,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.160]   I mean, we have in the airport a lot of things
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.560]   that somebody would hear something about someone else
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.760]   and go kill him and whatever, like anybody else.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.640]   So there's this, but somehow I wanna make fun of it.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.800]   And it is to be called an Islamo-Nazi,
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.960]   it must been the funniest thing ever
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.120]   because it's Islamo-Nazi, wow, how did you?
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.640]   And a radical Muslim, me, a lot of Islamists hate me.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.680]   They will call me a secular infidel.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.280]   (laughing)
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.000]   So it's kind of like, who am I?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.960]   Maybe I have an identity crisis
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.040]   and I need the people to tell me who I am.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.280]   - Well, let's go to the beginning.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.480]   Let's go to your childhood.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.440]   You grew up in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.680]   (laughing)
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.560]   Well, let's figure out how you came to be who you are.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.320]   - How did you become an Islamo-Nazi?
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.760]   - Yeah, exactly, it's a long journey.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.280]   I do like the swastika tattoo on your ass,
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.400]   which I didn't-- (laughing)
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.840]   - How did you see my ass?
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.800]   - You know what you did.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.600]   - I know what you did.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.480]   - It was very inappropriate.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.280]   You're also obviously a sexual harasser of me.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.160]   (laughing)
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.760]   - Is this like a me too?
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.600]   - Yes.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.200]   - This is like 2020, someone will come up,
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.000]   it's like, okay-- - Yeah, we have flip it.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.400]   This is your me too moment.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   - All right, so Cairo, what's a defining memory,
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.880]   positive or negative, from your childhood?
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.520]   - My memory in general was cool, it was cool.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.520]   I went to a Catholic school for primary school,
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.060]   the elementary, and by the time I'd done,
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.340]   there was kind of like a start of a decline
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.920]   into the public education, and my parents,
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.940]   they're like middle-class working officials.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.240]   My dad was a judge, my mom was a business professor,
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.560]   and they were like one of the people who's like,
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.280]   they didn't have that much luxury.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.160]   My dad drove like a regular car, a Fiat,
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   which is like the equivalent for the Lada in Russia.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.720]   - Thank you for speaking to the audience.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.720]   - Yeah, yeah, the Lada, and--
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.360]   - So would that be a good car or bad car?
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.640]   - No, no, it's kind of like the minimum.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.280]   My dad was not like a man of showing off.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.060]   Whatever money they would do,
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.420]   they would put it for us, education,
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.560]   give everything to their kids.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:55.560]   This is kind of like a very, very typical mentality,
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.720]   and I'm sure it's in many cultures,
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.900]   but like we grew up with this,
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.580]   like everything that we have is left for kids,
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.840]   so they would put us into education.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:06.900]   So middle school, that was the big,
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.340]   1986 was the beginning of the explosion
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.740]   of like international schools, private schools,
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.960]   and these schools were relatively expensive.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.240]   Of course, now with today's currency, it's ridiculous,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.600]   but at that time, it was very expensive.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.000]   So I went to that school,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.440]   and from, there was this moment was like,
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   you feel less right away.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.400]   I mean, of course, there's the regular bullying and stuff,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400]   but it's not that.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.000]   It's kind of like you always feel less.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.240]   You don't have that much of like purchasing power
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.120]   that allow you to go to the same outings
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.020]   or travel with them, and even like how you dress,
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.120]   it will be modest compared to them.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120]   So I was always an outsider.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.440]   I was, and I compensated with that by two things,
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.000]   being good at school and being good at sports.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.960]   So I was not like the typical nerd who was just like that.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.800]   I was like I was playing football, basketball,
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.000]   crattering field, and I was like one of the,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.600]   people would like to have me on their team.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.520]   So I wasn't like kind of like,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.000]   ah, he's a nerd, get him away.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.100]   But I never had a girlfriend.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.640]   I never had any kind of like,
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   it was not like, I was not boyfriend material.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.020]   So that's kind of like, it leaves remnants in you
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.240]   that you're not good enough.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.000]   - But psychologically, you're always,
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.560]   like when you're by yourself, you felt like an outsider.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.400]   - Yes, all the time.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.560]   And that's why it kind of like, I'm more of a loner.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.580]   I don't have a lot of what you call friends.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.560]   I have acquaintances, people that I do stuff with,
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.680]   but I don't have like the people
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.880]   that I tell them everything.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   When I went to medical school,
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.280]   now medical school is a different animal.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.320]   Medical school is where all of the people
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.100]   from the public schools go.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.840]   Public schools are very like, they are not,
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.160]   they don't have like, they don't have English language
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.960]   as like a strong partner, but they are brilliant people.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.800]   So because they would mostly study in Arabic,
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.200]   but they are brilliant and they are very, very,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.840]   very smart, very sharp.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.160]   But then I'll go there, now I am the sissy boy
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.800]   from the private school that comes into medical school.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.840]   Now I'm an outsider again.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   And I go into residency and I pick up salsa.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.120]   So now I'm a salsa teacher
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.520]   while being a cardiothoracic surgery resident.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.200]   And I'm an outsider for the third time
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.400]   because in salsa, I'm kind of like the respectful doctor.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.240]   And in resident, I'm the guy who is just dancing.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.680]   So and everything, of course, as a medical resident,
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.240]   you will mess up a lot.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.360]   So they would always like, oh, because you're a dancer.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.720]   Oh, because you don't care about medicine.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.960]   You just like wanna go there and dance with women.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.280]   (laughing)
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.120]   Which is true.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:34.960]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.000]   (laughing)
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.720]   And so all of my life, I felt that I'm an outsider.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.760]   I'm not part of the team.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.360]   I'm not part of the core group.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:51.080]   So and I have a story that you would love.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.120]   Right before my residency, I was so much into salsa.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.880]   So I had all of the money and then you save that.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.840]   And I was working summers and I was doing extra jobs.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.520]   And I took that money and I went to Miami
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.040]   in order to learn at Rueda de Cazino,
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.760]   which is the Cuban kind of like circle salsa kind of thing.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.280]   And I went there in the summer of 2001.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   And my return ticket was 9/12, 2001.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.200]   (laughing)
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.400]   - Universe has a sense of humor, I gotta tell you that.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   - No, no, no, 9/12, I was supposed to be on a plane
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.240]   coming back to Egypt.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.200]   What happens, thank God, I ran out of money
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.040]   10 days before that.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.680]   So it's like, all right, I changed my ticket
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.960]   and I came back, 9/11.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.960]   I'm kind of like, my mom, "Wake up, wake up, what, what?"
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.280]   And I see like the two tower phone.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.800]   It was like, my mom's like, "Oh, you're here, you're here,
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.440]   "you're here, thank God, you're here."
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:55.200]   And I was like, I could have been in Guantanamo right now.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.000]   (laughing)
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.440]   - Flying at 9/12.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.840]   - But by the way, I was in Miami when they went
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.880]   to the flying school, in Miami.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   So, I mean, I had like 9/11 written all over my face.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.440]   - You'd be all over the news.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.760]   - All over the news, and my mom's like, "What?
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.960]   "He went there to dance salsa?
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.080]   "I didn't know that salsa is like a name for terrorism."
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.400]   (laughing)
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.240]   - Why salsa?
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.000]   Why did that attract you?
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.720]   And what, like, can you explain what salsa is?
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.280]   So I mentioned to you offline that I've been doing
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.760]   a little bit of tango, trying to learn it.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.360]   - Yeah, like you know, samba, salsa, pachata, merengue,
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.200]   it's kind of like Latin dances.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.200]   And it's like, you know, I don't know how you describe salsa.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.720]   Couple dance on Latin beat.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.560]   (laughing)
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   And I did it because I once,
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.600]   and I talk about that in my Arabic stand-up comedy,
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.400]   not the English, I talk about like how I was, you know,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.280]   I didn't have like really like a great like social life.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.320]   And my friends went there one day and I go into a place
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.520]   which it was called El Ghetto Negro.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.240]   No, no, it was called Big Fat Black Pussycat.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.000]   And then I think they thought it will be like racist
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.240]   or something, so it should change it to El Ghetto Negro.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.080]   Anyway, so.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.640]   (laughing)
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.480]   - Great, great.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.320]   - I know!
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.140]   - Great decision.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:17.980]   - I know!
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.040]   So I went there, it's like, "Damn!
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.560]   "Music and women and my doctor,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.080]   "a doctor dancing salsa, that is a cheat magnet."
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.040]   - Yeah, 100%.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.160]   - You know, we do everything for that.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.000]   - All of humanity.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.600]   - Even power, even money.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.560]   - All the wars we've been talking about.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.080]   - Women.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.920]   - At the end of the day.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.440]   - The approval from the other sex.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.120]   We are babies, we are terrible people.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.560]   So of course, like, I mean, that was like great.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.840]   But then I, as a nerd, I went in so hard
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.640]   and now I became a salsa teacher.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   - Yeah.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.360]   - And I earned more money from salsa,
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.320]   more than I did as a doctor's resident.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.140]   (laughing)
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.040]   - I didn't know this part of you, that's hilarious.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.600]   - I know, I was making a killing amount of money.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.760]   Like, huge amount of money.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.000]   And I was just like, you know, I would go finish my shift
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.320]   and I'd go to the salsa class.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.020]   And sometimes I would have like 70 people
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.040]   in my salsa class.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:16.880]   - Oh, wow.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.560]   - I had like the biggest salsa class in Egypt,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.280]   in the beginning of 2000, and it was fantastic.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.560]   And it was an outlet, because you go there
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.720]   and there's the shifts and people dying.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.360]   Damn, and they go, salsa.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.200]   (laughing)
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.560]   - Can't escape.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.880]   You must have been good.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.760]   - I was okay.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.920]   I was cool, I was fun.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.300]   There were people better than me,
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.960]   but I have a thing about teaching.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.120]   I like teaching people.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.240]   - So you mentioned heart surgery.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.680]   So what motivated you to become a doctor?
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.280]   - It was a choice of exclusion.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.640]   I mean, there's nothing else you can do
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   with these high grades other than doctorate in engineering.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.180]   I hate math, so go be a doctor.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.440]   (laughing)
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.280]   This is the Middle East.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.120]   What do you expect?
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.680]   It's either, like in my joke in my show,
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.040]   I said like there's, it can be one of three things
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.720]   in the Middle East, a doctor, an engineer,
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.800]   or a disappointment.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.000]   It is, that is the choices that you have.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.500]   (laughing)
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.600]   So years after, I'm a disappointment.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.000]   (laughing)
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.240]   - Here I am.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.600]   - You're damn good at it, though.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.400]   (laughing)
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.760]   That's a hard path, though.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.600]   - Yeah.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.040]   - And it's a fascinating one.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:22.880]   - Can I tell you something?
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.700]   - Yes.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.240]   - I was thinking about why did I actually go into medicine,
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.400]   and why did I always choose the hardest thing,
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.700]   although I didn't love it?
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.880]   And I have to tell you,
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.800]   I had an epiphany only two weeks ago.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.600]   And I don't know if that's actually related or not.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.520]   You know, remember when I told you I went to this school,
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.720]   and I didn't have that much money.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.520]   And I didn't have the luxury of time or money
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.420]   to be with those people and do what they do.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.840]   So by the time I finished school,
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.240]   and everybody was going to university,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.680]   oh, everybody in my school went to the AUC,
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.360]   the American University in Cairo, of course, private, yeah.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.080]   Like American education, party time.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.440]   I mean, of course, they're brilliant and everything,
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.000]   but they have, yeah, they have a different social life.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.840]   And part of me, now I kind of like,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.920]   I realized that just like very, very recently.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.880]   Maybe I went to the hardest school ever,
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.880]   so I don't have space to use other than studying.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.000]   Because if I have that much space,
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.400]   what I'm gonna do with it?
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.320]   I don't have that much freedom, I don't have that much money,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.440]   I can't compete with those people going out,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.240]   so maybe I need a solid excuse that I'm in a place
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.480]   where I don't have that much of a spare time.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.880]   - Is it also possible, I like how this is a therapy session
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.280]   where we're psychoanalyzing, is it also possible
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.480]   that you always just pick the hardest thing
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.580]   you could possibly do?
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.200]   - Maybe, but--
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.400]   - Maybe that's the Piers Morgan thing, too.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.920]   - Maybe, but like when I left Egypt and I came here,
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.360]   I still had the choice to go back to medicine.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.880]   - Sure. - But I hated it.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.420]   I hated it, medicine traumatized me.
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   The amount of like, you give up,
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.360]   you know my brother in Egypt, he had a daughter,
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.800]   she's a brilliant basketball player.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.840]   She is in the national team, amazing.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.280]   I used to play basketball also in the Egyptian league,
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.680]   but I never, I was kind of like,
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.680]   my favorite position in the court was the bench,
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.120]   and I was not as good as her, but she,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.120]   and then it was time for her to go into college,
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.840]   and he didn't talk to me for six weeks.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.440]   I said, "Tamir, what's happening to Farida?
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.280]   "Which college?"
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.100]   Like, I didn't wanna tell you, she went into medicine.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.160]   I said, "What, medicine, why did he do?"
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.720]   Because he knows how I hated it.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.400]   I was traumatized, and I said like,
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.140]   "Dude, she's a basketball player.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.560]   "Make her go like to an easy school."
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.820]   So that's kind of--
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.600]   - You still did it, you still did it.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.080]   - Yeah, I still did it, but I don't know,
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.160]   is it because of the difficulty,
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.120]   or because of what I told you?
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.840]   Maybe I needed something.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.960]   Maybe because I was not very confident in my social life,
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.320]   so I needed a distraction,
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.880]   not to have that much of a social life.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.160]   - Oh, wow, okay.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.000]   - You understand?
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.840]   - Yeah, uh-huh.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.680]   - It's kind of love,
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.200]   because I will always have an excuse, I'm studying.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.720]   I have something, I have exams.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.540]   And I don't know, I kind of self-sabotaged my own thing,
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:22.100]   because I couldn't compete with those people
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.040]   on the outing, and the money, and whatever,
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.380]   so I need an excuse to be like,
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.620]   "Oh, he's a doctor, he's studying."
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.780]   - At least in your own mind, you couldn't compete.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:32.820]   I always felt as less,
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:36.180]   because I didn't have any girlfriends in school.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.420]   I had it very late in life.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:38.820]   Everything to me came to life,
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.260]   so I always felt, even stand-up comedy,
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.640]   it came very late to me in life.
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.100]   So I always feel that I'm not good enough.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.980]   I feel that I didn't spend the time
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.900]   to build the foundation that other comedians do,
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.180]   so I always feel that I am too lucky.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.060]   I always feel that this is a fleeting thing.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:03.780]   And when I went, had the height and the fall in Egypt,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.140]   when I went like, the top of everything,
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.140]   I was like, so famous,
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.500]   and then everything was taken away from me.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.780]   That's like, "Ah, you see?
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.680]   "I told you, that happens when you don't build foundation,
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.520]   "you fall."
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.560]   So I always feel that I am not good enough,
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.440]   or if I am in a position where people think I am,
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.700]   deep inside, I am not.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.060]   You know that I have a speech impediment
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:28.040]   that I was not meant to be a TV presenter.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.380]   I have an, in Arabic, it's very obvious.
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.740]   I cannot roll my R's.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:35.640]   I cannot say, "Er," I cannot roll it.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.060]   So in Arabic, like Spanish, it's very obvious.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.940]   So when I did my first video on the internet
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.780]   that made me famous,
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:45.060]   and then I got my television deal back there in Egypt,
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.940]   my partner at the time, he took the video,
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.560]   and he went to a producer and said like,
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.540]   "Are you giving me a guy with a lisp?"
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.460]   He couldn't, he should,
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.740]   that's why when I came on television,
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.580]   I was the first ever guy with a lisp.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.940]   I had two things going for me, the lisp and the big nose.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.240]   And I was always bullied for these two all the time,
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.180]   so I always felt less.
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.580]   - See, but that's the foundation of like,
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.180]   creating a great person.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.580]   - Yeah.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:09.920]   - Because if you're pretty,
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.140]   you don't need to do much.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:15.860]   - I probably wouldn't recommend it,
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.500]   but it is true that--
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.380]   - So if you are pretty, do some disfigurement.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:28.380]   - Find the flaws and be extremely self-critical about them.
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:34.820]   So you saw Jon Stewart on TV for the first time in 2003,
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.860]   I believe.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.780]   How did that change your life?
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.860]   - I was in a gym and I was running on the treadmill.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.240]   And at that time, CNN was coming out on cable.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:51.540]   And I was watching and there is this studio,
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.380]   I don't know what it is.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:57.340]   So I put the earphones on and I started watching.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:01.380]   And I was so taken by this that I stopped the treadmill
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.860]   and I just like stood for the 20 minutes like this
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.860]   on the treadmill and I just like standing there.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.220]   I didn't know what he was saying.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.580]   I didn't understand what is Democrats,
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.900]   what is Republicans, those names that he's saying,
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.220]   what is Fox News, I don't understand.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.260]   But I was fascinated.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.120]   There was something, you know when you don't understand
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.860]   the music but you get the rhythm?
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.940]   It was that.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.980]   - I wonder what that is that you saw.
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.580]   It's like the timing of the humor.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.120]   I mean, Jon Stewart is one of a kind.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:36.300]   His biting criticism of power, I would say,
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.980]   and also ability to highlight the absurdity of it all.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.500]   - But you understand, I didn't understand any of that.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.900]   But I didn't understand any of the references.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.820]   But it is the rhythm, the rhythm.
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:50.240]   You know sometimes when you even see like a comedy,
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.140]   that's a language you don't understand,
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.740]   but there's a rhythm, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.140]   Boom, boom, there's something,
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.140]   there's something in the music.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.980]   So there's something with the videos and the pictures
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.340]   and he and the face and people reacting.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.660]   - Yeah. - What is this?
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:05.500]   (laughing)
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.720]   What is this? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.560]   - What is this?
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.740]   And we had the global edition.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.700]   So I went to their YouTube and I just like started
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.700]   to kind of like watch every single episode that I can.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.100]   I said like, "Do you think we can have this in Egypt?"
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.820]   I said, "Nah, never."
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.420]   And then 2011, like I had a friend of mine
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:24.820]   who was also a YouTube partner,
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.060]   it was something new at the time.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.340]   He said like, "Let's do something on the internet.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.180]   "Let's do something."
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.220]   I said, "I wanna do with Jon Stewart."
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.560]   He's like, "No, no, no, no, do Ray William Johnson.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.740]   "Jon Stewart will not work."
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.340]   I was like, "Ah, I want to do Jon Stewart."
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.220]   - So that was in there.
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.500]   - Yeah, it was in there.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:42.260]   And I did it and it worked.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.340]   - Can you talk about 2011?
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.660]   I mean, what is it, the Arab Spring?
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.500]   What is it?
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.460]   People here in America, you know.
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.140]   (laughing)
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.420]   - Depends on which side--
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   - Did something happen or what?
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.660]   - Depends which side of the equation you are
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:00.460]   because for a lot of people, it's a conspiracy.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.620]   It's American-made.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.020]   It is the Muslim Brotherhood, it's the Islamists,
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.060]   it is Israel, it is everything else other than people.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.460]   Oh, but it's a pure revolution, it's a pure...
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:15.360]   I think we put too much weight on conspiracies.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.140]   I think it is normal human behavior
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.440]   that then become, get maybe used or abused
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.500]   or taken advantage of by other powers
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.540]   and then the conspiracy starts.
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.300]   But at the time, the Arab Spring didn't start in Egypt.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.220]   It started in Tunisia.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.540]   Bouazizi, a fruit vendor, burned himself up
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.420]   like the American soldiers who did that a few days ago.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:44.300]   And that kind of sparked protests in Tunisia.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.020]   And Ben Ali was a dictator in Tunisia
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.760]   for about like 20 years and they removed him.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.640]   So suddenly, it was kind of like a domino effect.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.840]   So then Egypt started and it just took 18 days.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.080]   And you know, people, hindsight is 20/20,
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.700]   since like Mubarak became like a burden on the military,
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.860]   because the military are the real rulers of the country.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.000]   You might have a president
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.340]   that kind of like have certain powers,
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.560]   but at the end of the day,
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.760]   when the military sees that a certain president
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.600]   is like too much of a burden, too much of like a,
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.280]   you know, so they cut him off.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.400]   - And Mubarak is the leader of Egypt at that time.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.720]   - He was there for 30 years.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:21.540]   - 30 years.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.280]   By the way, speaking of which, 'cause it was a joke
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.920]   in your Mark Twain speech.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.360]   I got teary-eyed just watching that.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.200]   That was just great.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.480]   You're like fucking great.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.160]   Like what you did doing Mark Twain awards
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.240]   for Jon Stewart, it's great.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.960]   I mean, your comedy is great in general.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.240]   And I wanted to go to your show, I definitely will.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.320]   But that's like a little stroll in the complete tangent
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.020]   of just the masterful introduction
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.720]   and celebration of Jon Stewart.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.960]   Anyway, Mubarak.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.600]   - Yeah, so it's a joke that I say also,
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.760]   like Mubarak was a president for 30 years.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.280]   Like, oh my God, you had a president for 30 years?
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.640]   Like it's the Middle East, it's a very short first term.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.400]   It's like, we're still warming up, baby.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.240]   - Just warming up.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.800]   - And I thought of like, we need to plan ahead.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.960]   We need to plan our vacations, our careers, our jail time.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.160]   It's just like, we need to.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.920]   (laughing)
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.000]   - That's great.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:09.840]   - So.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.680]   - That's true.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.000]   - So we had kind of like the shortest,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.080]   nicest revolution, 18 days.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.200]   And we thought, oh, 18 days,
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.400]   we can change the country in 18 days.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.960]   So, but of course, we were naive
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.680]   and we had this kind of hope.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.160]   So Mubarak was removed.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.120]   It was an interim period by the military,
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:25.960]   took it for one year.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.760]   Then they did elections, Muslim Brotherhood came to power.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:34.720]   They stayed for one year and then the military removed them.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.520]   And in these three years, my show started.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:41.760]   It started by kind of like a YouTube video.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.360]   - It became famous overnight.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.680]   - Overnight.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.960]   Five to six videos, boom, went out.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.160]   And at that time, I was waiting to get my clearance
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.480]   to go to Cleveland.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.960]   I was accepted in a fellowship
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.560]   as a pediatric heart surgery in a hospital in Cleveland.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.360]   And I said, all right, I'm just gonna do a couple of videos.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.720]   Maybe I'm gonna put it on the internet.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.080]   And maybe after a year or two,
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.240]   after I come back from the fellowship,
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.880]   somebody will come, hey, why don't you write a show
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.160]   that looks like John Stewart?
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.520]   That was my main.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.680]   Took five weeks.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.040]   I had my first contract of television.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.840]   And overnight, the exposure.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.760]   And over the next two, three years,
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   I had 30 to 40 million people watching every episode.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.400]   A lot of people are like, wow, that's too much.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.920]   That is terrifying.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:28.760]   - Yeah.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.400]   - Because it means that there are 30 million people
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.200]   who have an opinion about you.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.040]   - Yeah.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.520]   You said there's a lot of aspects of that sudden fame
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.360]   that were just horrible.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.200]   - It's toxic.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.040]   It's toxic.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:39.880]   It's unnatural.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.760]   It's unnatural.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.840]   When people started to recognize me in the street
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.280]   and take pictures, I was awkward.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.400]   Like, why do you wanna have a picture with me?
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.240]   Why?
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.200]   Is it because I didn't feel that I'm worthy enough
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.560]   to be like a reward for someone to have a picture?
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.440]   And I didn't understand it.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.760]   I was actually, I was kind of an ass sometimes
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.400]   because people thought it was arrogance.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.720]   No, it was confusion.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.320]   And I remember, like, my director and my producers
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.320]   and people around, they always saw me in a very bad mood.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.960]   It's like, why are you not enjoying this?
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.920]   It's like, because this is not natural.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.480]   This is not natural.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.680]   This adoration, this love, and this have to end somehow.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:17.960]   And it did.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.480]   And because at a certain point, you are human.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.400]   And people kind of, the adoration and the fun
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.040]   and the love comes because they see you saying stuff
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.920]   because you do your job, basically.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.360]   Political satire is basically us making fun
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.880]   of politicians in the media.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.480]   And a lot of people have a lot of really strong opinions
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.680]   about politicians in the media.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.000]   So we came that, we articulate that,
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.800]   and we give it to them and we make them laugh.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.840]   So for them, we made a great job.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.080]   So why don't you do more?
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.400]   But you are limited.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.360]   And at a certain time, you can't.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.880]   And at a certain time, you're afraid because we're humans.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.960]   Because you're afraid about, like,
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.400]   if I continue speaking up,
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.920]   not like something will happen to me.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.360]   I'm kind of like, maybe have some protection
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.960]   because people see me.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.760]   But what are the people around you?
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.840]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:09.920]   - And I've seen that.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.320]   So that's why at a certain point, it's like, that's it.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.240]   I can't.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.760]   - I mean, there's a lot of things to say there,
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.640]   but one of the difficult things of fame in your situation
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.960]   is you're not just having fun, you're criticizing power.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.040]   - Yeah, and it is loved by the people,
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.640]   but it comes with a price because at a certain,
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.160]   if the power is too strong and you are not into a situation
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.960]   or a system that allows that,
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.000]   that gives you that kind of safety.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.440]   - So what happened?
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.520]   (laughing)
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.760]   - What happened, I was, so when,
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.680]   so the height of my fame,
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.840]   when the Muslim Brotherhood was in power,
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.080]   and at that time, they had their media,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.160]   and I had one show.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.600]   I had like one hour per week,
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.040]   and they had five channels, 24/7,
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.480]   and they were like, you know,
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.240]   Jon Stewart said it beautifully once.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.480]   It's like, we say shit and you say shit,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.360]   and we just say shit better than you.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.200]   (laughing)
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.320]   This is exactly what Jon Stewart was like.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.160]   We're just better,
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.200]   we're real better at saying shit back and forth.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.040]   - Yeah.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.120]   - So basically, I had one hour,
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.800]   and they had like the five thing that they were like,
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.240]   you know, they're calling me all kinds of names,
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.280]   not just me, like all their enemies, you know,
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.520]   and then I just had one hour,
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.680]   and I would kind of like annihilate them in one hour a week.
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.880]   So at a certain point,
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.120]   they would even like kind of be side with the army
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.360]   against the kind of, the liberal sectors,
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.200]   whatever you call it,
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.040]   and at a certain point,
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.440]   the army kind of like flipped everybody.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.280]   - What do you mean?
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.360]   - Like kind of like they made,
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.320]   they removed the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.360]   they came to power,
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.720]   and we, I have to say,
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.640]   I admit it, I supported that in the beginning
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.360]   because I had daily threats,
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.600]   I was actually interrogated
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.000]   and arrested under the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.800]   I was in an interrogation for six hours,
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.560]   and they were asking about my jokes,
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.040]   and I used that in my stand-up comedy,
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.120]   describing exactly what happened in the six hours,
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:03.960]   and it is so funny.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.800]   (laughing)
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.560]   - Okay, well, it's hilarious.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.760]   (laughing)
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.520]   It's slowed down.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.920]   You were interrogated by the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   - The general prosecutor,
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.760]   the general prosecutor,
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:17.080]   and it was based because of complaints
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.280]   by the officials in the government
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.080]   because in order for the general prosecutor to do it,
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.360]   it has to have a high-up mandate
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.000]   to bring that person to questioning.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.560]   - So they went through kind of official channels?
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.720]   - Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.560]   - So it's all--
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.440]   - Yeah, it was official.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.640]   It was legal.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.480]   - Very legal.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.840]   - So I went there and I asked,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.320]   and it's kind of like a bunch of like insulting Islam,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.560]   insulting presidents, spreading false rumors,
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.320]   and I went there and it was funny
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.040]   because I go into the building
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.040]   where there's police officers and their judges,
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.120]   and all of them are big fans of the show.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.320]   (laughing)
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.280]   And some of them were taking pictures of me,
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.360]   and then I'm sitting there
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.680]   and it was the most ridiculous interview ever
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.120]   because he was asking me about my jokes.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.320]   It's like, "What did you mean by this joke?"
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.480]   And it's like, "Nothing."
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.200]   (laughing)
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.600]   It was there for six hours.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   - He's just reading your jokes back to you.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.120]   - He was reading my joke,
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.040]   and he's reading the jokes,
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:10.960]   and the junior judge is sitting there like cracking up.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.520]   It's like, "I remember that."
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520]   It's like, "Guys, guys!"
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.600]   - That's dark.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.360]   - It's kind of like, and I'm laughing,
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.200]   but in the same time,
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.120]   it's like the whole situation is ridiculous.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.280]   But then at the end, I was released on bail,
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.800]   so I went back to my show, and I make fun of that.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:29.320]   And you have to be honest,
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.760]   the Muslim Brotherhood were in power,
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.400]   but Egypt were like right out of the revolution
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.440]   for there was kind of like an equal spread of power
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.280]   between the people.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.760]   There was not like someone would come in and just like,
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.920]   the Muslim Brotherhood didn't have that power yet,
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.280]   but they were kind of,
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.440]   people saw that they were moving towards that.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.800]   And then the tension rose,
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.200]   and then there was like a kind of a confrontation
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.400]   between them and the army,
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.240]   and then a lot of people were killed in the street.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.840]   It was terrible massacre.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.680]   And then suddenly, I am blamed for all of that.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.400]   It's like, "You made fun of us,
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.560]   "so now it made it easier for people to kill us."
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.800]   Like, "Dude, come on, you're doing that to me too.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.240]   "I just did it better than you."
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.680]   And the fact that you sided with the same people
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.560]   that flipped against you, that's not my fault.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.160]   - Did you criticize the army at all?
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.760]   - Yeah, so after that show,
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.440]   I did like one episode against the army,
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.240]   and I was canceled the next day.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.560]   And then I went to another channel,
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.200]   did 16 episodes in a different season,
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:25.000]   and it was like, I was walking on eggshells.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.080]   And then that was canceled again.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.800]   And then the production company that was doing my show,
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.400]   that we severed ties because we didn't have the show.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.160]   They had their offices raided.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.880]   They have people having death threats.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.360]   So I woke up one day, 11th of November, 2014,
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.480]   and my lawyer said, "Leave the country right now.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   "There is this legal case that they're coming for you."
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.640]   But I said, "It was an arbitration case,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.160]   "and I lost against the channel that basically canceled me."
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.320]   And I said, "But there's no jail time in arbitration."
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.280]   I was like, "Yeah, tell that to the judges, leave."
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.960]   So I jumped on a plane.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.320]   The verdict was 12 noon, 11th November, 5 afternoon.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.520]   I was on a plane, left Egypt,
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.160]   and I never came back since then.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:16.320]   - Was there a worry of non-legal things like assassination?
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.320]   - I can tell you something.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.600]   I was so stressed because of the show,
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.800]   because of everything.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.920]   I sometimes, I would wake up in the morning,
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.360]   and I hope that a bullet will come and finish everything
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.160]   because I was so stressed.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.440]   It's like, I would love,
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.600]   because I'm too much of a chicken to kill myself,
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.480]   so I would rather have someone else do it for me.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   So I was under so much pressure,
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.800]   and I remember the day that my show was canceled
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.520]   indefinitely, the second time, under the army.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.720]   And I was like, (sighs)
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.560]   I don't have to worry about what kind of script
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.520]   I have to write next week.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.400]   Because this is, you know,
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.880]   I remember when you asked me about that tweet,
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.240]   but all of those, this accusation doesn't bother me.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:06.220]   Infidel spy, a secret Jew, Zionist,
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.400]   Islamo-Nazi, that's bullshit.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.040]   What is really, what really leaves a mark
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.860]   is the criticism to your craft and your work.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:19.680]   So if you're not funny, it goes deeper.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.280]   - Yeah, certain things get to you better than others,
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.060]   especially if you have a secret suspicion
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.400]   that you are maybe not funny.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.520]   - Maybe I'm not, because I was put into that,
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.360]   because that toasts to your insecurities.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.240]   Like, I know, but you shouldn't say it out loud.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.440]   (laughing)
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.160]   - You shouldn't say the truth out loud.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.000]   - You shouldn't say it out loud.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.480]   Like, give it to yourself. (laughing)
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.560]   - But what about the weight of the responsibility
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.660]   of speaking truth to power?
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:51.020]   So like walking on eggshells, what did that feel like?
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:56.020]   - Well, after the Muslim Brotherhood were removed,
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.280]   you have to understand, like when the military coup happened,
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.280]   it was a very popular coup.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.200]   Like, people loved the army.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.440]   In Egypt, the army is more sacred than the religion.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.120]   People love the army, but the army can go on and on.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.760]   So me going against the army was,
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.600]   I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood was not very popular.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.080]   They were popular for their own basis.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.000]   But people accepted the fact that we make fun of them.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.640]   But Sisi, at that time, he was a god.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.480]   And I used to go to this high-class club called Gizira Club.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.200]   And this is basically kind of like the,
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:31.340]   kind of upper-middle-class, upper-class kind of people.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:34.440]   And during that year of the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.600]   I was the most popular ever.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.600]   People come, yeah!
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.280]   When the military came in, people were walking to me,
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.040]   like pointing their fingers, like,
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.560]   "Don't speak about Sisi, don't speak about the army, huh?
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:49.080]   "We love you now, but don't you," they were like that.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.160]   So I called John Stewart, I was like,
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.120]   "I don't know what to do."
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.320]   I don't know what to do.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.660]   And at that time, all of the channels were closed down,
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.040]   all of the independent, I was the only one left
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.480]   because it was difficult for them to get rid of me
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.120]   very quickly because I was too popular.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.000]   It was kind of like piecemealing, kind of like going.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.560]   And I remember, I was like, "I don't know what to do."
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.860]   He said, "You don't have to do anything,
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.640]   "just your safety comes first."
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.720]   And I said, "But I can't, I mean,
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.420]   "I've been doing that for two years
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.420]   "and I cannot just like say, bye-bye, guys.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.780]   "I have a responsibility, I have a team,
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:25.280]   "I have people working for me.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.860]   "And I also, I cannot just like disappear."
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:35.160]   And he said the most interesting thing ever,
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.320]   and say, "If you're afraid of something,
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.980]   "make fun about the fact that you're afraid of it
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.400]   "instead of talking about that something."
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.240]   - Yeah.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.920]   - So there was like a whole episode
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.480]   that we did not even mention Cici.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.400]   We did not even mention him,
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.840]   but the videos did all the thing.
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.800]   And the whole episode was me
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.600]   trying to avoid talking about him.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.480]   And that how the comedy was created.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.000]   The fact that I don't wanna be here,
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.600]   and I don't know, so he said like,
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.000]   "If you will be surprised how people can relate to that,"
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.440]   because there was a lot of kind of like,
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.480]   "Oh, we love him, but we feel we cannot speak."
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.080]   So just by doing the simple thing
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.880]   about mirroring the society,
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.080]   that goes a long way.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:23.920]   And I kind of tried to do what I can under the military.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.040]   I mean, they came up with (laughs)
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.040]   a machine that treats AIDS and hepatitis C virus,
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.880]   and basically every single,
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.480]   and I went to town with that.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:42.760]   Because people think it doesn't really have to go
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:45.520]   to the bigger posts, like, "You're an asshole."
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.960]   No, you talk about their propaganda.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.100]   You talk about what they want people to perceive them at.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.240]   And it's a failure.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.920]   And for that, that kind of hit them even more.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.400]   Because what do authoritarian figures do?
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.840]   They work on two things, fear and propaganda.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.800]   And from that, it gets the respect.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.040]   So when you go into their propaganda and expose them,
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.120]   they have nothing else.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:11.960]   - That's brilliant.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.360]   Like, you are walking on eggshells,
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.440]   but you're doing it masterfully.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.320]   That you're revealing sort of the flaws in the propaganda,
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.520]   the absurdity of the propaganda,
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.280]   and in so doing, you're criticizing them.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.720]   - And this is why comedy is very specific.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.480]   Because people say, "You were not as hard on him
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.320]   "as you were on the Muslim Brotherhood."
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.700]   It's like, "Yes, because on the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.560]   "we were just like saying shit to each other."
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.900]   But now, the ceiling was like here.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:37.320]   So it's kind of like, how can you do something from here?
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.320]   That's the art form.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.720]   - Yeah, and in the Soviet Union, under Stalin,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.880]   a lot of the criticism came from like children stories
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.000]   and children's cartoons.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.180]   - Double meaning, double in the window stuff.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.440]   That means other stuff.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   That is the brilliance.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.000]   - But everyone knows.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.480]   - Everyone knows.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.360]   - Because you are like putting a mirror.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.320]   You're mirroring the society.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.160]   It's fascinating, actually.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.600]   - And that's why I was canceled twice.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.640]   (laughing)
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.960]   - And that is a scary one.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.520]   The army, you see that in Ukraine.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.800]   Everybody supports the army.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.760]   That's why Zelensky getting rid of the head of the army
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.800]   was a big, big deal.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.400]   It's a really dangerous thing.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.360]   'Cause everyone's afraid to say anything negative
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.180]   about the army, especially during war, in that case.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:29.720]   And in this case, maybe there's civil war,
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.560]   that kind of thing.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.380]   - But think about it.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.000]   Actually, an army during peace is much more dangerous.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.960]   Because think about it.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.520]   I don't really have an enemy to fight,
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.120]   but I have all of this power, all of this tank.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.280]   Why does this actor have more money than me?
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.220]   I'm protecting him.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.920]   Why does this businessman think that he can get
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.640]   on his private plane and go to Paris?
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.640]   And why I'm here sitting, not having all of these things?
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.320]   And there's a lot of time on your hand,
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.280]   because your job is to go fight.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.140]   When you don't go fight, and when you have the lack of,
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.840]   that's one of the things I love the United States about,
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.800]   is the fact that the army cannot really get power,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.100]   but the kind of like, the army is,
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.080]   the power is actually in the military industrial complex,
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:13.920]   which is a different thing.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.740]   - Yeah.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.580]   (laughing)
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.320]   - It's kind of like a different kind of issue.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.520]   But if you have all of that power,
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.840]   like why am I sitting around just like playing guard
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.720]   for you guys?
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.240]   - That's why Iran is terrifying,
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.860]   'cause you have this military that just becomes
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:28.880]   a police force that turns against its own people.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.720]   - Yeah.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:35.040]   - So you're, you're a famous guy talking shit
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.400]   in the middle of all that.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.560]   - Yeah, and I, when I left,
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.160]   I went through a very dark side, dark, dark, dark,
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.800]   because all of the insecurities,
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.640]   all of the stuff that had been like working on my head
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.000]   now came to life, and now I'm in America,
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.920]   and I'm a nobody, I'm a nobody.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.400]   And now it's like, I have to do something,
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.240]   I have to earn some money.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.280]   So I started to do stand-up comedy five years ago.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.920]   And I sucked, because it was my second language,
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.560]   and it was new, and now I will go to these comedy clubs
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.080]   with like kids, and 21, 22 people,
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.480]   and then I'm there with a family to support that.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.320]   I'm going there to do it for $15, $20, and I was bad.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.160]   I was bad.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:14.980]   - You're bombing.
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:15.820]   - Bombing big time.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:16.660]   - Eating shit.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.360]   - Eating big time, dying up there big time.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.000]   And I would go back home and I would cry.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.880]   And then what made it worse is sometimes,
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.600]   like a fan, like not a fan, a bunch of fans from Egypt.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.800]   It's like, oh, Bassem Youssef, you know that?
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.640]   They come, it's like.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.440]   (laughing)
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.280]   - Yeah, just start.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.840]   - Disappointments on their, that kind of,
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.380]   like face of adoration that goes.
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:41.640]   (laughing)
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.960]   And I could see it in their face.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.200]   I think he's gonna drive an Uber in a couple of weeks.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.280]   (laughing)
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.320]   That's, that kind of pressure.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.600]   And I would go and I would cry, and then essentially,
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.520]   oh, you left, you gave up, you're a sellout,
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.200]   you're a coward, why don't you speak from abroad?
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.400]   You're safe now.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.420]   It's like, I don't, I already spoke.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:09.960]   I don't want to be, 'cause I don't wanna be an activist.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.760]   I was doing that for comedy when it was good for everybody,
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.840]   but now they want me to go into YouTube
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.000]   and just like throw rocks from outside.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.040]   And it's like, you know what, I understand,
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.000]   I have family there.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:19.960]   (laughing)
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.360]   And it was this kind of like thing like that,
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.360]   I am being like attacked for not doing what I should do
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.000]   in their face, and attacked for not being funny,
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.800]   and not doing good, and now I'm a fan,
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.960]   like maybe it was wrong, and I was,
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.920]   I didn't know, I really, it was so traumatic
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.480]   that I don't know actually how I went through these years,
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.240]   and I blocked so many details from my brain,
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.240]   because I have been using this technique for a while now
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.760]   that I have been erasing a lot of my,
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.760]   there is a lot of memory gaps in my brain,
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.280]   and I'm trying to suppress it
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.980]   because it was very, very, very traumatic.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.400]   And a lot of people told me you have to go to therapy,
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.760]   but I don't, I can't, I don't know,
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.600]   I'm worried to open the floodgates,
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.200]   and I'm thinking as if I'm functional,
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.420]   and I'm not killing anybody, I'm okay.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.680]   (laughing)
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.320]   - It's like, I think Elon tweeted never went to therapy,
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.480]   it's gonna be on my headstone.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.320]   - Yeah.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.800]   (sighing)
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:25.360]   (laughing)
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.800]   - Two of your best buds, okay.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.860]   - I mean, that is terrifyingly difficult,
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:34.960]   like, after being a surgeon,
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.440]   after being a superstar, super famous,
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:43.440]   going to eat shit at local tiny clubs in the United States,
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.320]   I mean, eating shit, period.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.140]   - Yeah.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:47.840]   - Like, bombing is really, really, really difficult,
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.160]   really difficult for 20-year-olds.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:51.000]   (sighing)
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.200]   (laughing)
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.740]   - Imagine when you're 45, 46,
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:57.580]   and then people's like, is this his midlife crisis?
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.420]   What is this?
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.080]   (laughing)
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.080]   I went through a lot of pain and a lot of doubts,
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.120]   and it was terrible.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.960]   - Wait, I mean, how did you survive?
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.400]   I know you brought up most of it,
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.880]   but what gave you strength through all that?
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.720]   - Because I didn't have any other choice,
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.240]   because I started that,
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.560]   and the only reason that I could is to continue.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.800]   I don't know what else to do.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.360]   I don't wanna go back to medicine.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.400]   I don't wanna go, I don't want to do that.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.280]   And I don't know, I was, and bit by bit, bit by bit,
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.080]   I started to kind of like, be better, be better, be better.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.120]   And I was, at a certain time, a year ago, a year ago,
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.700]   this is where I started to kind of like hone the craft
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.700]   and kind of sell more tickets,
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.220]   and sometimes even sell out some shows,
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.300]   and sometimes sell a theater.
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.020]   So like, it was going, and the money was flowing,
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:50.860]   and it was good.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:56.180]   And then I was like, why didn't, I wanted faster,
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.760]   I wanted more, I want it now,
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.060]   I want Netflix deal, or whatever.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.300]   And then the Piers Morgan thing happened,
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.140]   and then I blew up,
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:03.780]   and then suddenly I'm selling out everywhere.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.780]   And it's like, ah, if those people came,
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:09.840]   if the war happened two years ago, I will not be ready.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:12.260]   So now they come to the show,
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:14.660]   and by the way, my show had nothing to do
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.860]   with the October 7th.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.260]   My show is my thing that I've been crafting
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:19.100]   and working on.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.140]   You know how difficult it is to do the first hour,
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:25.220]   the hour that I've been working on for five years,
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:26.820]   and it's all my personal story.
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.140]   All about like what happened to me as an immigrant
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.180]   coming here to the United States,
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.460]   finding Trump as a president,
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.740]   finding myself in the middle of a gun rally,
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.300]   finding myself in the middle of a bombing,
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.380]   kind of like talking about how I got my citizenship.
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:40.980]   It's all like funny stories about like my origin story.
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.860]   So they come in, and they expect October 7th,
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:44.100]   and all those things are my personal story.
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:46.020]   But it's good, and it kills, and they love it.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:48.980]   It's like, if that kind of like blew up in America,
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.660]   happened to me two, three years ago,
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:54.180]   I would not have people who come and be disappointed.
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:57.180]   - I gotta say, the timing of October 7th is very suspicious.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.660]   - Oh my God, please don't say that.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   - I don't know.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:00.780]   I'm just asking questions.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:01.620]   I don't know.
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.900]   - I'm telling you, one of the funniest thing,
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:08.300]   a guy, I was in Dubai, and like a TV anchor came to me.
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.860]   "Basim Youssef, he flourishes during revolutions and wars."
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:13.340]   Like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what, what, what?
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:14.180]   Dude!
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.220]   (laughing)
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:18.560]   You're making me sound like a bad omen, a very bad omen.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.780]   (laughing)
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.500]   - Yeah, you, Hamas, and Bibi together orchestrated all this.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.900]   - Oh my God, that's the trilogy.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.820]   (laughing)
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.740]   - You guys should go on the road together.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:31.260]   Telling you, that phone call is coming.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.780]   - Yeah, but Hamas has to open.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:34.620]   (laughing)
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.420]   - And they would really bomb, right?
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:37.800]   - They would really bomb.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.060]   (laughing)
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:42.700]   - I love dark humor.
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:44.460]   You do a show, like you were saying,
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:47.380]   in English and in Arabic.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.180]   So, and the story is very different.
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:52.020]   - Totally different, two different stories.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.660]   - I would love to, just the language difference.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.140]   Because it's the music of the language is also different.
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.620]   So like, what's, how can you convert it into words?
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:03.780]   But what's the difference in the music of the languages?
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:05.300]   I'll tell you.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:06.460]   'Cause I thought about that a lot.
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.720]   (laughing)
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:13.100]   So, when I was doing the English first,
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:16.100]   I was, I actually had good jokes.
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:17.580]   But I was missing the delivery.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.620]   Because the cadence, and the music,
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:21.300]   and the rhythm is different.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.940]   The way that an English-speaking American
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.900]   member of audience will receive it,
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.660]   it will be different than how I receive it.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.420]   The energy, everything's different.
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:34.220]   So, when I kind of like got it,
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:39.220]   I didn't know how to switch back to Arabic.
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:42.980]   - Oh wow, yeah, fascinating.
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.620]   - Because here's the thing, with English stand-up comedy,
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:45.820]   English stand-up, you have a huge library.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:46.660]   You have like a legacy.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:47.820]   You have like years, and years, and years,
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:49.460]   and years of people doing comedy.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.860]   But in Arabic, it's very new to us.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.580]   And most of the Arabic stand-up comedy,
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:56.640]   especially in Egypt, is very tamed.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.420]   This is kind of like, imagine the stand-up comedy scene
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:04.740]   in the American 1960s before Lenny Bruce.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.300]   - Oh, so no swearing, conservative, careful.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:08.340]   - No swearing, nothing conservative,
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:11.660]   everything kind of like, yeah, it's kind of like very.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:15.220]   So, I didn't know what to do with Arabic.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.540]   So, I broke the barriers.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.660]   I became Lenny Bruce, I became George Carlin.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:21.260]   So, I went in, and I went, and I changed the whole thing.
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:23.060]   - The seven words you're not allowed to say, whatever.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.700]   - For me, they're 15 words.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:25.540]   - How?
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:26.360]   (laughing)
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.140]   There's a lot, there's a lot.
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.740]   - Arabic is a very rich language.
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:30.660]   - Yeah.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:34.300]   - So, when I did, here's the difference
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.300]   between the Arabic and the English show.
[01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:40.160]   The English show, surprise, surprise,
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.740]   is a unifying language, even for a group of Arabs.
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:47.060]   So, if I give the same exact show
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:51.020]   to the same 1,000 audience members in the same theater,
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.220]   and they're the same people,
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:56.820]   same makeup of Lebanese, Egyptian, Syrian, Saudis,
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:59.680]   English will be a unifying language.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.460]   Arabic is a dividing language.
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:02.300]   - Why is that?
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.340]   - Because you have 22 dialects,
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.220]   and the dialects are vastly different.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:08.100]   And maybe Egyptians understand a little bit of Lebanese,
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.740]   but not that much, but the references,
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:12.660]   Algerian, Moroccan, Tunisian, totally different animal.
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:14.140]   That's like a totally different language.
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:16.660]   Saudi, Emirati, Kuwaiti, totally different.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:18.140]   People understand the Egyptian dialect
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:18.980]   because it's the dialect
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:21.860]   of most of the artwork and the movies,
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.860]   but the reference in the everyday street talk
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.300]   might not be understood by them.
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.700]   So, now I have to go in
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:32.060]   and talk to all of these dialects together.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.560]   So, I formed my, big part of my show is like,
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.260]   what are you guys expecting of this?
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:41.340]   This is what, this is, we gonna,
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:43.740]   when I go do profanity and you're gonna like it,
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:47.540]   this is the problem with the show as a dialect,
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:50.220]   and I construct all of these sentences
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:53.340]   formed of so different, different words.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.900]   For example, an iron.
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.580]   In any, in any, in any Arabic dialect is an iron.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.020]   In Saudi Arabia, it means ass.
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:03.300]   That's one example.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:04.860]   That's one example, you know?
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:07.500]   So, imagine if you can actually construct sentences
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.220]   having all of these things in one sentence.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:12.220]   So, I would construct like a whole section
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.780]   of my show about that.
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:15.820]   - So, it's really very much about
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:17.460]   self-reflective on language
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.300]   and the limits of language that's allowed.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.260]   - And the limits of language,
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.860]   and I tell them, part of the show is like,
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:23.780]   I know what's the problem with me doing Arabic.
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:25.060]   It's like, if this was an English show
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:26.220]   and I was telling you, "Fuck and shit,
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:27.660]   "I bet you'll be ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,"
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:30.340]   but if I do one swear word, all of you will scrimp.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:31.180]   - Yeah.
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.140]   - It's like, why?
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:36.060]   Is it because we are ashamed of our own language?
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.220]   So, it's kind of like, it's not just about swearing.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:42.260]   It's about, there's a lot of philosophical pathways in this.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:45.020]   Yeah, there's profanity, and people have fun, whatever,
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:48.820]   but it is about, how do we treat our language?
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.660]   And I tell them, we speak Arabic as Arabs,
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.900]   but it's not the same Arabic.
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:54.740]   It's crazy, right?
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:56.380]   - And you're doing the show in America also,
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:57.580]   which is another level of obscurity.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.420]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.580]   Actually, the Arab diaspora in America
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.940]   is some of the best audiences I have.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:05.820]   They are like wonderful, and they come from,
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:08.940]   and I did it also in the Middle East,
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.420]   and maybe I'll do like an Arab tour
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.060]   in the Middle East in the fall.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:14.540]   - Which countries would you go to and not?
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:18.540]   - I worried, Jordan, Lebanon, I'm doing UAE,
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.060]   I'm doing Kuwait, Egypt, Bahrain.
[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:22.700]   Egypt, I don't think so.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.700]   I don't think so.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:25.460]   - Is it personal?
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:29.860]   Is it worry about your safety?
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:32.140]   - Well, I have the American citizenship right now,
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.560]   so I am relatively safe.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.120]   There's a block.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:36.960]   - Sure.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.180]   - Honestly, there's a block.
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:42.140]   There's so much that happens,
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:44.660]   and I will never badmouth Egypt.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:45.500]   It is my country.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:49.380]   It has all of my marriage, 40 years of my life I lived there.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:51.820]   But when you get hurt so much,
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:54.980]   instead of trying to kind of,
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:57.980]   I don't wanna take revenge, I don't wanna like that,
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.140]   I just want to avoid.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:03.340]   Because Egypt gave me so much fame and so much love
[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:05.540]   and so much hate and so much rejection.
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:10.540]   It is a very, it was a very tumulus relationship.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.540]   Very, very difficult.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:16.220]   And a lot of people tell me, well, don't you miss Egypt?
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:17.720]   And I tell them every time,
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.540]   the Egypt that I miss is not there anymore.
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:21.100]   It's not bad or good.
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.620]   It's not worse or better.
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:25.100]   It's just, I'm different, and the places are different,
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.060]   and the people are different,
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:27.460]   and the circumstances are different.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.360]   Whatever image that you have of what you love
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.200]   is not there anymore.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:33.700]   That's why a lot of immigrants, especially Arab immigrants,
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.340]   they live here, but they're there.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:38.180]   And then when they go back for a vacation,
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.020]   they get disappointed
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.820]   because they didn't find what they want.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:42.580]   And then they come back here and they're disappointed
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:45.100]   because this is what they wanna come back,
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:46.920]   but it's not there anymore.
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:51.860]   - Yeah, their view of that place is from a different time.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:54.400]   I have that, you know, my parents,
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.100]   but everybody that left the Soviet Union,
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:01.820]   I mean, it's such a complicated relationship with that.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:06.020]   It's sometimes borders on hate, disappointment.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:08.660]   In the case of the Soviet Union,
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.060]   perhaps similar to Egypt,
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.820]   is the promises sold when you were younger,
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:16.140]   and the promises broken by the possibility
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:17.740]   of what it was supposed to be.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:21.220]   With the Soviet Union, I'm sure with Egypt is the same.
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:22.580]   Iran is the same.
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:26.460]   So they have a very complicated relationship with that.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:29.180]   - Yeah, that's why, like, for example, people from Iran,
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:31.200]   I remember quite well the World Cup
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.500]   that was made in the United States,
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.700]   and the Iranian team were playing America,
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.860]   and there were people in the audience all wearing Iranian,
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.340]   they hate the regime,
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.140]   but they have this kind of connection with the country.
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.780]   And this is the whole thing.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:49.280]   You can actually love the country,
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.480]   and you don't have to agree with the regime.
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:56.380]   - Would you ever perform in the West Bank?
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:57.340]   - No. - Gaza.
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:58.300]   - Because if I go there,
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:59.980]   I have to go to the Israeli checkpoints,
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:01.140]   and I don't wanna go through this.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:03.580]   I don't want to have an Israeli soldier
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.700]   telling me what to do.
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.540]   - Yeah, there's a demeaning aspect to that whole--
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:09.140]   - Very. - Even in subtle ways, yeah.
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:12.660]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I have so many Palestinian friends
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:15.020]   with an American passport, U.S. passport, living here.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.260]   They are born here.
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:19.460]   And they talk about the humiliation, and the intimidation,
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.500]   and the harassment that they go in.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:24.900]   It's like, do you want me to try? (laughs)
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.340]   - Yeah, that little bit of a humiliation.
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:32.740]   A little bit. (imitates gunshot)
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:34.180]   - Well, sometimes it's major, but--
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.740]   - I know, I know. - I notice that
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:40.460]   even the little bit has, after a lifetime of that,
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:44.060]   it can turn to hate towards the other.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.340]   - Yeah, and resentment.
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:47.740]   - Resentment, and then how do you do anything
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.820]   with that resentment?
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.100]   - I have a friend of mine.
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:52.300]   He is from Palestine, from the West Bank.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.500]   He's American here, he's born here.
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:58.540]   And we talk about, you know, we have, of course,
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:00.000]   all of this discussion about what happened.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.120]   And he tells me, you know, in October 11th,
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:06.880]   in the West Bank, and there was a village called Kosra.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.400]   And on that village, like, the settlers went in
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.040]   around the village, and they sent a message on Facebook.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.640]   It's like, you rats, get out of your sewers,
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:16.880]   and we're gonna be waiting for you.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:19.120]   Intimidation through technology.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.320]   And then they went, it is,
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:25.480]   Kosra have like another settlement next to it
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.640]   called the Eshkodesh.
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:30.180]   Eshkodesh, they have people there
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:34.120]   who were training something called Mishmereti Yisha,
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:36.620]   which is basically the guardians of Yisha.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.640]   And it's like a paramilitary group
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:42.940]   that trains other settlers on military combat.
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:45.780]   Give them weapons and do like military drills.
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:48.740]   And they went there like militarized, and went there.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:53.140]   And it was actually co-founded by a Jew from Brooklyn.
[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:57.040]   Not even, and like an Israeli.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.620]   And he is like one of the disciples of Meir Kahane.
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:01.220]   I'm sure that you know who Meir Kahane is,
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:03.340]   who was the Jewish defense lead,
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.700]   the people who assassinated Alex Aouda
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:06.900]   here in the United States.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.660]   And they were there with their weapons outside
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.500]   intimidating people.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.860]   Now, this story carries everything
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:16.500]   that is wrong with the situation.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.460]   You have people from Brooklyn, from outside,
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:20.020]   just because they're Jewish, they can't come,
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.060]   and they can claim the land from the people there.
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.580]   Anybody from Poland, just because he's Jewish,
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.820]   you can come and take the land from other people.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.720]   They're using technology to intimidate Palestinians.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.160]   They have unchecked military power.
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:33.040]   These are not IDF soldiers.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.160]   These are settlers, and they have free reign
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.360]   in order to intimidate and to kill the people.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.480]   And you understand, this is the daily life of Palestinians.
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.600]   Not in Gaza, in the West Bank.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.040]   - What do you do from your, what do we do,
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:51.040]   what do people do to nudge this towards peace,
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:55.900]   towards flourishing?
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:56.740]   - Here's the thing.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:00.100]   I wanna talk to the people of Israel.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:04.340]   What is Israel doing right now is not just unfair
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.540]   to the Palestinians, it's unfair to the Jewish people
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.380]   in Israel.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:10.660]   No, it is unfair to the Jewish people around the world.
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:15.660]   Because the way that Israel links itself to Judaism,
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:18.360]   at a certain point, you know, remember like ISIS
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.700]   and Qaeda and when everybody hated Muslims?
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.440]   You know, sometimes, humans are simple.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.500]   They cannot have the nuances to separate.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:30.180]   So, anybody who, with a Muslim name, with a Muslim face,
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:32.180]   with a beard, who looks Muslim, he would do it
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.180]   because of that actions of those atrocities.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:38.960]   You have the power, as a person, to separate yourself
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.020]   from an abusive power, a horrible power, and be yourself.
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.580]   I am really worried because the rise of anti-Semitism
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:47.900]   and the rise of hate against Jews
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:50.060]   is not because of the Jews.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:53.100]   It's because of the actions of the government.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.580]   Jews do not have to be on the side of apartheid.
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:59.500]   Ronnie Kestrels, he is a Jewish South African
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.700]   and he fought shoulder to shoulder next to Nelson Mandela.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:05.300]   He was part of the African National Conference, ANC.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:07.340]   And he had an article saying like,
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:09.260]   "I know what apartheid is and I saw Israel
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:10.700]   "and this is what they have."
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:15.540]   And the thing is, Israeli government should listen
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:17.380]   to other people.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.500]   You cannot call anybody who criticize you
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:23.020]   either an anti-Semite or if they're already Jewish,
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.260]   you call them like self-hating Jew.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:26.100]   You cannot do that.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.180]   You cannot continue doing that.
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:28.020]   Because we did that.
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:30.020]   When I would go in and criticize the Islamists,
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:32.100]   it was like, "Oh, you're a self-hating Muslim.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:32.940]   "You're not really Muslim.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:33.980]   "You're an infidel, you're a secret,
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:35.980]   "you're a secular," or whatever.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:40.980]   We have the power in order to reform the course
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.660]   by holding people in power accountable.
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:47.020]   And the thing is, it is very stupid
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.620]   to actually call this anti-Semitism.
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:52.060]   And like, my idol is Jon Stewart.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:53.500]   I voted for Bernie Sanders.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:57.900]   Sarah Taxler, the one who did this amazing documentary
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:00.260]   about me, "Tickling Giants," she's a Jew.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:01.980]   She is married to an Israeli Jew.
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.620]   We have a good ratio because we know what the right is.
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.660]   They don't have to associate themselves
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:09.140]   with the action of the Israeli government.
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:11.980]   - One of your favorite words, "jihad."
[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:13.780]   (laughing)
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:14.820]   - That's my favorite hobbies.
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.660]   - It's his favorite hobby.
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:17.500]   - It's my show.
[01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:18.580]   It's like, what's his favorite?
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.620]   I talk about how when a white shooter
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.740]   does something, he talks about all of his family
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:24.580]   and all his hobbies.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:27.700]   Like, what if we did this for Arab terrorists?
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:28.620]   What are his hobbies?
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.460]   Jihad.
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:31.060]   (laughing)
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:31.900]   - You see?
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:32.720]   You could be a comedian!
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.560]   - Yeah.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:36.540]   Wow, you're making me feel good.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.100]   Okay.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:43.100]   Sam Harris has done several episodes on jihad.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.460]   And people should go listen to it,
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:48.260]   even if you disagree with it.
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:51.460]   But the basic idea that he's proposing
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.460]   is that this idea of jihad,
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:56.300]   in the negative connotation of it,
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:59.820]   of martyrdom is a thing that gets,
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:03.220]   is counterproductive, is destructive
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:07.420]   to the possible future flourishing of Palestinian people.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:09.940]   What do you think of that?
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:10.780]   There's just the idea of martyrdom.
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:13.060]   - Yeah, I totally agree, but people don't wake up
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:16.260]   in the morning and say, "I wanna declare jihad."
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.100]   Think about it.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:20.500]   Why would anybody choose to end his life
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:23.100]   by taking other people with him and end that life?
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.600]   His life must be miserable.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.460]   He must be pushed into that.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:31.860]   Nobody chooses death over life willingly.
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:34.580]   One of the first suicide bombers
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:36.940]   in the Palestinian resistance were Christians.
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:40.700]   We don't talk about that.
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:44.820]   I think he would say that the presence of a story
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:45.900]   that you can tell yourself
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:48.540]   when you're in a really shitty place,
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:51.260]   that you can go to a much better place
[01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:52.940]   by sacrificing your own life.
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:55.540]   Just the fact that the presence of that story is there
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.220]   is harmful.
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:59:01.540]   - Of course, but here's my problem with Sam Harris,
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:04.820]   and usually people, they have free range
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:06.260]   talking about the Islamic faith
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:11.260]   and nitpicking the stuff that makes it put in a bad light.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:13.960]   I can go and nitpick every single religion.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:17.580]   There are Jews there, like Bin Ghafir,
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:19.420]   who openly says spitting on Christians
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:21.860]   is not a hate speech, all right?
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:25.400]   They are, I mean, you can bring me all kinds of videos
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:29.380]   of Islamic jihadists saying horrible things on YouTube,
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:31.000]   and I can bring you Jews who live there.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.700]   They are like, "We're gonna have the whole world
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:34.340]   "enslaved for us, and everybody would love
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:35.840]   "to be enslaved for the Jews."
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:39.940]   I can use the Talmudic argument
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:42.960]   that if you tie a man to a tree
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.660]   and he dies of thirst and hunger,
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.400]   you didn't kill that man.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.060]   And this is kind of the same arguments,
[01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.260]   like, "Ah, we're not killing Palestinians.
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:52.180]   "It's just like killing, they're dying by themselves."
[01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:56.420]   So it is, the nitpicking of a certain narrative,
[01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:59.220]   religious narrative, that is separate
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:02.940]   from the political context and what's happening right now,
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:04.940]   it's very unfair, because I can read,
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:08.780]   if you wanna have a deep dive into religious texts,
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.820]   nobody will be happy, and I can bring stuff
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:14.220]   from the Talmud and the Torah and stuff that is horrible,
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:18.360]   but this is a way, again, of distraction.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:23.600]   - I dare you to talk shit about Buddhism and Jainism, though.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:25.000]   Try. - Well, you know,
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.920]   the people who killed the Muslims in Myanmar,
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.200]   weren't they Buddhist?
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.200]   - Yeah, well, let's go, Jaden.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.400]   Okay, I'll find the religion, I'll get to get back to you.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:34.240]   I'll have to find it.
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:36.720]   - Yeah, the Flying Monster,
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.680]   the Church of the Flying Monster Spaghetti.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.280]   - The Flying Monster. (laughs)
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.380]   As a person who tries not to eat carbs,
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.640]   I'm deeply offended by that.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:46.580]   - I mean, they're Scientologists,
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.640]   all they do is actually buy real estate.
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.340]   (laughing)
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:52.660]   - I think there's a few books written
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:55.060]   about the fact that they do other stuff as well.
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:59.860]   So even there, Mormons sometimes,
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:02.260]   they're some of the nicest people I've ever met,
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:04.560]   but I'm sure there's also darkness there, too.
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:07.140]   Oh, boy, religion.
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:10.460]   - There's soaking in Mormon.
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.260]   - There's what?
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:13.100]   - Soaking.
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:13.920]   - What's soaking?
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.540]   - Okay, so I don't know how much.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:19.500]   So soaking, basically, if you get into the woman
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:25.340]   and you don't move, that's not adultery, that's not like--
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:26.180]   - Oh, interesting.
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:27.200]   So there's a loophole. - Yeah, you go in
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.040]   and you just take.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:28.880]   - There's a loophole.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.720]   - There's a loophole.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.540]   - That's the thing.
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:31.380]   Religion has a loophole.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.220]   - Religion has a loophole.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:34.220]   - Yes, and Muslims, we do that the whole time.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:37.420]   We pick and choose our sins, the stuff that we enjoy.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.020]   It's just, where are you?
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:41.020]   - There's 72 versions waiting for all of us.
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:43.420]   Maybe if I converted you as a Jew, I'll get you 80.
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:45.220]   I don't know, you can negotiate.
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:48.340]   - But I also have questions about whether--
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:49.900]   - That would be a very good deal.
[02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:51.980]   And maybe I'll throw there a Camry.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.980]   - I have to be honest, Camry, it's pretty good.
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:56.820]   What year?
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:57.660]   I don't know.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.940]   - 1998, best year ever.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:02.720]   - Well, they last a long time, so.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.700]   I'm not sure I want 70, I need to--
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.360]   - I'll throw five in the mix and see how it feels.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.200]   - Yeah, can we--
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:10.040]   - Upgrade?
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:12.620]   - Yeah, can we do a trial period?
[02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:16.360]   - But in general, if you just zoom out,
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:20.480]   do you think religion is, in what way is it good
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:22.760]   for the world, and in what way is it harmful?
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:23.920]   - If there was no religion,
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.680]   humans would have invented religion.
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:29.080]   Because think about it, think of the early humanity.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.640]   You're a caveman or whatever,
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:32.720]   and then you see your family members killed,
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.760]   and then you say, what, I'm gonna be the sheet
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.480]   or the gazelle that just ends and perish?
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.940]   I need to have, I am more important.
[02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:43.640]   I think with the development of consciousness,
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.640]   humans thought that they are much more precious
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:50.520]   and important than the other animals,
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.680]   because they have now intelligence.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.960]   So my life will not end like that.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:58.720]   My death will be even more important.
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:00.240]   There's consequences for that.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:01.760]   There's consequences for what I do.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:06.000]   And then the early man was there in the desert
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.760]   and all of these natural phenomena.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.720]   They didn't know what to do, they were afraid.
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:10.800]   So they need to have refuge.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.440]   They need to have something to take care of.
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.520]   They need to have a reason for everything.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.760]   Because if there's no reason, it's chaos.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.040]   It's chaos. - It's terrifying.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.320]   - It's terrifying, it's terrifying.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.400]   There's nothing, there has to be a reason.
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.440]   There has to be a reason, there has to be a purpose.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.920]   It has to be a cause, something.
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.840]   It's just, I'm not just gonna be like die,
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.560]   like a cockroach being stepped on.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:36.880]   And that's kind of like part of this ego.
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.840]   - The whole world rotates around you in a way.
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.720]   - It's the ego.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.480]   So religion actually got a lot of it from humanity itself,
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.840]   like me, us, like us being humans.
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:51.840]   And there's, and many religion is a collection of stories.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:55.480]   And those stories based on things that humans did themselves
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.280]   and they attributed it to gods.
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:59.440]   - And there's an aspect to religion
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:01.880]   where you humble yourself before a thing
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:03.600]   that is much greater than you.
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.000]   So that has a, I would say,
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.080]   a very positive effect of humbling.
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.360]   - It will be great if it's stopped there.
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:13.320]   But here's the thing, if you humble
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.080]   in order that your ego kicks in
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.840]   and feel that you are better than someone else
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:19.440]   who's not humbled in front of the same god,
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:22.240]   that means that I will have all of that train
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:24.080]   that I can use that,
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.040]   because now, what does it mean being humble?
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.480]   I'm divine, but you're not.
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.160]   - I'm way more humble than you.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.040]   - But you're not.
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.320]   So you see how they kind of like the oxymoron,
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.760]   I'm humble and I'm surrendering,
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.440]   but in the same time, I am better than you
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.280]   and I'm more entitled.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.320]   Isn't it crazy?
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.520]   - Yeah, it's beautiful, it's crazy.
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:44.560]   - I mean, look at like the Muslim Christians
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:45.840]   and Jews and every, like you say,
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:47.120]   all right, Muslims, we surrender.
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:48.520]   I mean, I'm talking about the extreme ones.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:52.640]   I mean, like people say, I surrender to God, good.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:53.920]   Keep it that way.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:56.080]   Like, if you go there, I surrender to God,
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:58.000]   that means that I am closer to God than you,
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.440]   then you should die!
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:00.720]   Okay, Christians.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:03.000]   Christ is love and he loves me
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.200]   and we're gonna be together,
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:07.040]   but you don't get into his kingdom and you die.
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:08.240]   You see, it's the same thing.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.400]   - It's just, if you--
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:11.440]   - Stop it.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:14.440]   - Stop there, stop where you are humble
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.520]   and you feel that you're a piece of shit
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.800]   and you are worthless human being
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.320]   and you are there, stop there.
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:22.400]   But once you say like,
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.560]   oh, that makes me a better person than you
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.480]   and it makes me more with God than you,
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.280]   so that will give me the entitlement to kick your ass.
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.520]   - Yeah, we always ruin a good thing.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.360]   - Don't we?
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:34.840]   (laughing)
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:36.520]   - That ego.
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.960]   You've been outspoken, you know, with Piers Morgan,
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.920]   but just on this topic,
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.920]   and you talked about the Superman story,
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:51.160]   which I would love it if you were in a Superman movie,
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:56.440]   but have you lost job opportunities because of this?
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:58.540]   - There was other, a couple of things that were going on,
[02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:03.040]   but they stopped, again, I don't know if it's October 7th.
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:04.240]   - Can you tell the Superman story just so--
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:05.080]   - Yeah, yeah, so--
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:06.320]   - What role were you?
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.160]   - Okay.
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:07.980]   - What did you audition for?
[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.000]   - Yeah, it's, okay, okay, all right, all right, okay.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.640]   (laughing)
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:14.940]   So in June, I was traveling to Dubai,
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:18.560]   and right, an hour before I get into the car and go there,
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.240]   my manager's like, "Bes, I'm gonna send you a script,
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.920]   "read it, it's for Superman."
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:22.760]   It's like, oh, Superman.
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.200]   You know, I'm not really good in auditions,
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.600]   I'm not a seasoned actress, so I was like,
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:29.500]   "Okay, I'm just gonna do it, send the tape."
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.200]   I do the tape, I send it, I go to the airport,
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:35.440]   and I read, and I think I can talk about it now
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:37.080]   because they said they changed the script.
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:40.120]   So basically, what I found interesting in that new script
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:43.880]   is that there is like a dictator in a country
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:46.040]   that invades another country,
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:48.960]   and Superman interferes politically.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.080]   That's the first time we ever see
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:52.060]   Superman interferes politically.
[02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:54.220]   So basically, it was like Russia and Ukraine,
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:55.860]   but because of me, it was like,
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:57.060]   it couldn't be Russia and Ukraine,
[02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:59.160]   so it had to be something kind of like with a flavor.
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.760]   So I read the role as if,
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:03.360]   as a mixture of Trump and Mubarak.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.900]   (laughing)
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:08.140]   I did this mix, and like, you know,
[02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:09.860]   like the kind of the mix,
[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:14.860]   but also like kind of like the essence of Trump into it.
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.060]   I went to the airport.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:17.900]   It's like an hour.
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:19.660]   It's like, James Gunn saw it, he loves it.
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:20.500]   It's like, what?
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:21.980]   I never had an audition that fast.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:25.180]   I mean, I had a few roles, but not that fast, not like that.
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:30.780]   And then it's like, well, the strike starts like tomorrow,
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.500]   and we need to be on the phone,
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:33.620]   but after the strike, we cannot talk.
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:34.580]   The sag after strike,
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:36.940]   like where the writers and the actors strike.
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:38.260]   So like, well, I'm gonna be on a plane right now.
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.980]   It's like, wait, once you land,
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.340]   you can have a Zoom call with James Gunn.
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:44.520]   I have a call with James Gunn.
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.780]   I am a huge fan of him.
[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:47.980]   The guy took like something like "Guardian of the Galaxy."
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:48.820]   Nobody knew about it.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:50.620]   Made amazing trilogy.
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:52.660]   And he is like a really cool guy.
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:54.340]   I like what he did.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:55.780]   And it was like really nice.
[02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:57.980]   And he started to talk to me about the movie.
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:01.500]   And you know, like I talk to people before casting them,
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:04.140]   so I know that everybody's on set, have a good chemistry.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.180]   It was amazing.
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:08.740]   So in your mind, if you're an actor, what does that mean?
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:09.580]   You got the part.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:11.140]   And he told me, you got the part.
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:16.580]   Month goes by, strike goes by, October 7th happens.
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:18.900]   I do "Piers Morgan" one and two.
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:21.140]   And then I go to my Australian tour.
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:24.140]   My manager called me, asked him, the Cirque was over.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:27.080]   It's like, you don't get the part anymore.
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:29.900]   I was sad, very sad, but for three days.
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.060]   And so like, I need to stand up with it, khalas.
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:34.220]   I'm actually doing very well, alhamdulillah.
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:41.340]   And then when I went to Chris Como,
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:46.500]   after I finished the show,
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:49.180]   he told me, did you lose any opportunities?
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:50.420]   And that was off record.
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:52.160]   After the show was like, we concluded.
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:53.580]   And I said, I talked about "Superman."
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:57.580]   And I found myself, when I was talking, I was angry.
[02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:58.420]   I was bitter.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:01.620]   And I went home, it's like, why was I angry?
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:03.340]   Why was I bitter?
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.180]   It wasn't meant to be.
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:05.780]   And I'm living a good life now.
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:08.120]   I don't need to.
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:10.300]   So when I was asked again,
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.780]   the next day in two different interviews,
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:14.820]   the BBC and another one was alone with my friend,
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:16.500]   you know, with Allah.
[02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.500]   I said the story in a different way.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:20.740]   I said, I don't have any anger.
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:23.340]   As a matter of fact, maybe if I was "Wonder Brothers,"
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:24.340]   I didn't talk about James Gunn.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:25.900]   I thought it was the studio.
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.340]   If I was "Wonder Brothers" and I'm a Muslim,
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:31.700]   I wouldn't have like a Zionist or a pro-Israeli in my movie.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:33.020]   But I want to tell them that like,
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:34.340]   when I criticize Israel,
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:37.720]   I am not a threat to you as a Jew.
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:39.380]   And we can actually have more in common.
[02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:41.420]   I was more of a kind of empathic.
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:44.060]   So when I said that, the internet went crazy.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:45.620]   And you know, James Gunn have hatreds
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:48.780]   because you know, the Snyder verse and all of the,
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:52.220]   that it's just, it's a word that I don't understand.
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:57.220]   And James Gunn, like, had all of these attacks on him.
[02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:00.900]   And I was pissed of how it was handled.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:04.460]   I wasn't angry at James Gunn, but I thought it was,
[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:05.660]   so my publicist, my manager's like,
[02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:08.220]   Bassem, stay calm, don't speak.
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:12.140]   It's better like to, like, not talk about it.
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:13.160]   I said, okay.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:14.860]   So as I'm, there's nothing wrong about me,
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:17.700]   but I see the heat is rising against James Gunn.
[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:19.860]   And that is a guy that I had a personal connection with,
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:20.940]   even through Zoom.
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:22.620]   And I didn't like what was happening.
[02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:23.740]   And then he called me.
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:25.820]   And he explained to me, I said, Bassem, you know,
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:28.660]   I actually use, like, have camera tests before people,
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:31.220]   before finally, I didn't know that.
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:33.060]   And I, and then we changed the script
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:34.380]   and it was the strike, so I didn't call.
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:36.060]   And I also, I thought to myself, I'm small.
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:36.880]   I'm a small actor.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:39.120]   I'm not that important for him to call me
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.980]   to say we're gonna change the script.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:45.740]   So I still think that, like, the timing sucks and everything.
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:48.080]   But then I went and I did a video explaining
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:49.600]   exactly what I'm telling you,
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.000]   because I didn't want to be famous for the wrong reasons.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.200]   Because that would be unfair.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.480]   Because that was, already people were,
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:58.800]   and I was having, like, interviews.
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:10:59.640]   Can you come up to someone?
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.600]   It's like, guys, that's it.
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:01.440]   I'm not gonna talk about it.
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:03.240]   Because this is an issue.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:07.520]   And I didn't, and I, when I talked to James on the phone,
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.820]   I felt how sincere he was.
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:12.840]   So I didn't want someone to, because of me,
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:13.800]   will have that kind of attack.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.080]   Because I know what it means
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.000]   to be on the other side of that kind of attack.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:17.920]   It's terrible.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:19.040]   And it ruins your life.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.200]   And it ruins your day.
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:22.000]   And nobody deserves to be doing that.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.360]   And I don't want to be the reason
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:25.720]   for someone else to go through that pain.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:27.800]   - And you also said that you don't want to be a victim.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.080]   - I don't want to be.
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.040]   I'm doing a great, I'm doing great.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.480]   I'm selling out everywhere.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:35.240]   I'm having a wonderful, loyal audiences coming to me.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:37.200]   Why I would be angry about the role of Superman?
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.560]   Yes, it's great to be in a superhero movies.
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.300]   But so what, you know?
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:44.820]   - But you know, there's a wisdom in that,
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:46.660]   even if you weren't doing great,
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:50.620]   that's a choice a lot of people can come to,
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:52.980]   which is like, do I play victim here or not?
[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:54.220]   - It's greed.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:55.620]   It's greed.
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:57.060]   They want more attention.
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:58.620]   They want to be more into the thing.
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:11:59.740]   They want more and more.
[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:03.340]   And there's so much to go around to be enough for all of us.
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:04.940]   But it is greed.
[02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:09.060]   It is ego, ego, ego, ego.
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:10.160]   I need to be in the center.
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.680]   I need to be victimized.
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:15.040]   I need to be people feel sorry for me and love me.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.800]   And it is not the right way.
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:18.880]   It is not because it is fake.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:19.720]   It is fake.
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:20.960]   It's made up.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.600]   And I did not victimize myself when I left for Egypt.
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:25.160]   I mean, in the time that I was,
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:26.600]   and now I speak about it now.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:31.200]   But in that dark times, I was detained in airports.
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.160]   I didn't have my American passport yet.
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:34.760]   I was still traveling with my Egyptian passport.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:36.800]   And I was detained in an Arab airport.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:38.520]   I was going to be delivered to the Egyptians.
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:41.120]   I had shows when I was still starting.
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.560]   I had hecklers being sent to me by the Egyptian embassy
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:47.860]   and Egyptian consulate in New York and in London
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:50.800]   to curse me and to take videos of that
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:53.100]   and then send it to state-run media in Egypt.
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:55.240]   And I didn't speak about that
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:57.600]   because I felt that if I speak about that,
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:59.120]   I feel about what was going on to me,
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.300]   I would be victimizing myself.
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:01.380]   It's like, if I'm gonna be good,
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.860]   I'm gonna be good because of what I do,
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:04.760]   not because of what people's perception
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.860]   of what I'm going through.
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:08.740]   - Yeah, and that becomes a slippery slope
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:10.780]   and somehow victimizing yourself--
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.260]   - Goes to more victimizing.
[02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:13.100]   - Yeah.
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:14.660]   - And then you cannot leave that habit.
[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:18.460]   You can only exist and thrive if people feel sorry for you.
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:20.580]   - Yeah, I mean, Israel and Palestine
[02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:23.800]   currently both have that temptation.
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:28.500]   - I would always push back when you do the comparison
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:32.020]   because one of them is not really in the same kind of power.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.260]   I mean, yeah. - For sure, for sure.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:34.100]   So to you, that's a big problem.
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:35.940]   - I mean, it's very easy to say
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:37.340]   why Palestinians would victimize themselves,
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:39.940]   but Israel with all of that military might, man,
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:42.420]   it's too much.
[02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:44.380]   What Israel is doing is that they're victimizing
[02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:45.700]   the Jewish experience.
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.500]   And I don't think it is fair for a lot of Jews.
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.500]   I don't think that they should use the Holocaust
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:56.900]   and the persecution that happened to Jewish people
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:59.500]   all through history in order to push
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:01.300]   an equally oppressive agenda.
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.980]   That is not fair and it's not good
[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:05.140]   for the Jewish people living.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.700]   And it is basically a disrespect
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:10.060]   to the memory of the Holocaust.
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:12.820]   I told you, I wanna make a movie about the Holocaust.
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:15.100]   I do, because what happened
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.220]   was that kind of engineered torture
[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:18.420]   should never happen again
[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:20.020]   and it should not be happening now.
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:21.380]   - So to you, what Israel is doing
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:23.460]   is leading to more anti-Semitism in the world.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:24.700]   - 100%.
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:25.780]   And I think, and you know,
[02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:27.940]   can I be a conspiracy theorist for a second?
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:29.260]   - Please, the earth is flat.
[02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:31.700]   We all know this. - A part of me thinking
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:33.820]   maybe they are doing that intentionally
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:36.300]   because if there's a rise of anti-Semitism in Jews,
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.740]   there were always like points like,
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:40.140]   see, they hate us so we can do whatever we want.
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:46.060]   Because you see, if we let go of our might
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.820]   and our strength, we're gonna go back
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:50.020]   to the concentration camps
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:52.020]   because you see how the world hates you.
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:56.180]   - And again, when you say they are people in power.
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:57.380]   - Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:14:59.380]   Listen, it's always the people in power.
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:02.140]   I believe that humans are easily corruptible
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:06.220]   and easily repairable, but the corrupt part is much easier.
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:11.580]   But people could change, but power,
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:15.780]   people in power are very dangerous, very, very dangerous,
[02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:20.020]   especially if you have religion, which is power by itself,
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:22.740]   military might, political support, and money.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:27.740]   Dude, that's a very, very, very dangerous recipe.
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.020]   - You know, all that said, I do believe in the power
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:32.300]   of the little guy, the individual,
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:34.020]   to overthrow the government.
[02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:34.860]   I don't know if you heard,
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:38.220]   but the Arab Spring happens.
[02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:40.620]   - But, okay, here, we're--
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:42.940]   - Just among friends.
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:44.420]   - We're Americans, right?
[02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:45.740]   We're Americans.
[02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:47.220]   - Allegedly.
[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:48.220]   - We're Americans.
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:50.540]   (laughing)
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:51.500]   - How funny is that?
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:53.140]   Like, just giving our two backgrounds.
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:53.980]   We're Americans.
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:54.940]   - We're Americans.
[02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:56.580]   We're Americans, it's like.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:59.100]   (laughing)
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:00.860]   We're Americans.
[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:03.020]   There's one thing about the power of the little guy
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:07.780]   that I am very sad about, because, you see,
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:09.500]   I love America, by the way.
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:12.620]   I consider it my new home,
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:14.460]   and I want my kids to grow up here.
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:17.580]   I'm very grateful for the opportunity
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:18.860]   that I have in the United States,
[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:21.220]   and I criticize the United States politics,
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:23.020]   and I criticize it out of love,
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:25.060]   the same way that I was criticizing
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:27.060]   what's happening with Egypt out of love.
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.740]   What is worrying for me
[02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:33.900]   is how the power of the little man is diminishing.
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:39.220]   It doesn't matter now who do you vote into power.
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:40.540]   They will not listen to you.
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.580]   They would listen to the people who paid them to be there,
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:45.100]   and it is very concerning,
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:47.340]   because I can see the American democracies
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:51.980]   turning, not even slowly, very rapidly into an oligarchy.
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:54.380]   If I'm sure that all of the millions of people
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:57.780]   who are voting, they don't vote for the NRA.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:16:59.980]   They don't vote for AIPAC.
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:02.780]   They don't vote for the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:06.460]   They don't vote for the military-industry complex,
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:09.180]   and yet, the people in power,
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:12.340]   they come in, they take your vote and my vote,
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:15.460]   and they are loyal to those people, not to us,
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:20.460]   and it is very, very, very concerning, very concerning,
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:25.580]   and this is the danger on the American policies,
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:27.860]   on American politics and American democracies.
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:29.680]   It is dangerous, because basically,
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:31.940]   the vote becomes just like a ceremony,
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:38.380]   that someone with the more funding will get to power,
[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:40.620]   and then he's not loyal to you.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.760]   - Still, the fire, I mean, we are in Texas.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:47.300]   Everybody's armed to the teeth here.
[02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:50.260]   - Yeah, but what are these arms gonna do in front of tanks?
[02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:54.220]   - Well, you said the American military
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:55.740]   is unique in this way.
[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:57.780]   - I know, but for now?
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:00.740]   - For now, the tanks are, first of all,
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:03.460]   I believe Russia has more tanks than the United States.
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:06.060]   Tanks, I don't know, I'm not an expert
[02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:09.800]   in military strategic deployment of arms,
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.900]   but the United States uses different kinds of weapons.
[02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:15.500]   - They have drones, and they have the lasers,
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:18.060]   and they're sitting comfortably behind the screens.
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:20.380]   It's kind of like it turns into a big Xbox game.
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:25.380]   - Yeah, and they sell a lot of those things to everybody.
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:29.060]   - It's crazy, because the defense budget
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:30.980]   is 68% of American military.
[02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:33.840]   It's like almost $850 billion each year,
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:38.380]   and most of that weapons, we don't even need it.
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:41.780]   We just do it because of the contracts.
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:44.100]   There was like an incredible 60 minutes.
[02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:46.220]   I'm sure that you saw it, the one about the gouging
[02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:48.140]   of the prices of the Department of Defense.
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:49.700]   It was one of the most fascinating things
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:50.840]   that I've ever seen.
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:53.700]   They say like a valve, a safety oil valve
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:58.700]   that used to be sold for $329, now it is sold for $9,000.
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:03.220]   Why, because there's only five weapon companies,
[02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:05.940]   and they can control the prices, and in 2006,
[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:09.760]   the whole Apache fleet of the American army in Iraq
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:12.180]   was grounded because there was one valve
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:13.420]   that they were like gouging the price
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:14.700]   and didn't wanna give them.
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:18.500]   The Stinger missile, that's just like the missile,
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:23.380]   the one that you carry, and it's like the anti-aircraft.
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:25.020]   It used to be sold for $25,000.
[02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:29.240]   Now it's sold for $400,000, and nobody is doing that.
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:30.080]   You know why?
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:33.100]   Because the DOD has fired 130,000 people,
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:34.860]   including engineers and negotiators.
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:37.780]   So now, in order to cut expenses,
[02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:39.180]   now we're paying more money.
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:42.780]   And the thing is, we do not have a say in this.
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:45.060]   We do not have a say in how my tax money
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:47.140]   and your tax money is being spent,
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:48.540]   because I'm sure you don't want your money
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:49.940]   to be sent to Israel like that.
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.860]   I'm sure, even if you're Jews, I'm sure.
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:53.300]   I'm sure that like, I don't want my money
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:54.660]   to be given to some Muslim countries
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:56.940]   who kill other Muslims, I'm sure.
[02:19:56.940 --> 02:20:00.140]   But it is not, here's the thing.
[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:02.680]   What kind of power do we have other than speaking?
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:05.580]   So what is left for us is free speech.
[02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:08.500]   And now when you speak, they call you anti-Semitic.
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:09.800]   You see why I'm angry?
[02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:10.980]   (laughing)
[02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:14.340]   - But still, I mean, America's holding pretty strong
[02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:17.580]   despite the criticisms on the free speech front.
[02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:19.980]   But if you look at the freedom of the press,
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:23.780]   freedom of the speech index, America is not at the top.
[02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:26.340]   - It is not, and this is why, for example,
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:29.740]   it is very disheartening for me to see
[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:32.380]   that the Western media, Western press
[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:35.060]   that used to be the beacon of freedom
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:36.940]   are now using as mouthpieces.
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:39.920]   And it is funny how the New York Times,
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:44.100]   Nixon got angry in the New York Times in 1971
[02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:47.260]   when they found leaks about him lying
[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:49.860]   about the Vietnam War since the beginning.
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:52.460]   And now he hired the plumbers,
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:55.140]   the special units and orders to go in and find the leaks.
[02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:56.980]   This was Watergate, basically,
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:59.020]   because he was angry to see who leaked that
[02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:01.260]   instead of fixing the problem.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:03.620]   Now the New York Times have published this story
[02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:05.900]   about the rape that was a hoax
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:07.180]   that was written by Anna Schwartz,
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.980]   who's someone who has no experience.
[02:21:08.980 --> 02:21:12.700]   And now when it was leaked,
[02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:14.860]   instead of them correcting themselves,
[02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:16.900]   they went in and they had their own investigation
[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:17.900]   to see who leaked.
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:20.400]   The New York Times in 2003 became the mouthpiece
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.140]   for George W. Bush of the WMD.
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.740]   And now, as an American,
[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:25.420]   I see that the New York Times is becoming a mouthpiece
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:26.940]   of a foreign country.
[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:28.140]   Why do you do that?
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:30.740]   - One of the things that's really difficult to know
[02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:32.360]   is where to find the truth.
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:37.100]   It does seem that both sides use propaganda
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:39.680]   and both sides lie a lot.
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:41.860]   - But both sides, as in?
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:43.020]   - Both Israel and Palestine.
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:44.260]   Pro-Palestine, pro-Israel.
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:45.260]   There's a lot of lies.
[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:50.260]   - I know, but it's a lot of inequality, man.
[02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:53.340]   There's a lot of people on the internet,
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:57.660]   but who have the mainstream media siding with?
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:22:00.580]   - Yeah, but thanks to social media.
[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:02.260]   - Yes, thank God for social media,
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:03.860]   because now it's individuals.
[02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:04.820]   They are people.
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:05.640]   - Yes.
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:06.480]   - They are people.
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:08.780]   You're comparing BBC, New York Times,
[02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:11.060]   Washington Post, Wall Street Journal
[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:13.020]   with just people with a TikTok account.
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:15.140]   - Yeah, who have more power, in your view?
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:18.420]   - Now, it is actually very, very fascinating
[02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:20.660]   to see the little man having that power over the media.
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:24.540]   - In fact, it's proportionally so, this is my problem.
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:27.580]   - But you cannot call people with TikTok propagandists
[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:30.220]   while people being paid to give you the news
[02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:31.780]   and they deliberately lie to you.
[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:32.620]   - Well, yes, I can.
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:34.060]   They're both propagandists.
[02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:36.660]   - Well, okay, yes, yes.
[02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:40.760]   But the mechanism and the intentions are different,
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:42.660]   because here's the thing.
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:45.260]   - I'd rather have the TikTok guy than the--
[02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:47.540]   - The TikTok guy is a TikTok guy, all right?
[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:52.540]   But if you have the New York Times being exposed
[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:55.780]   to be lying, and then they get this UN report,
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:58.980]   which is like a disgrace, and you just put the title
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:22:59.820]   and you don't talk about it.
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:02.900]   It's like, I'm fine with CNN and Jake Tapper
[02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:05.100]   and all of those people spreading
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:07.340]   the rape allegations for years.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:08.960]   I don't even want them to refute them.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.820]   I want them to bring the Israeli reports
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:13.460]   saying that it didn't happen.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:16.060]   The Israeli media themselves, they didn't even bother.
[02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:17.260]   Not once.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:18.540]   Is that balanced?
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:19.380]   That's not.
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.360]   So that's why people in TikTok,
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.740]   because they have to take matters in their own hand.
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:26.540]   - Yeah, but the problem with the people in TikTok
[02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:30.340]   is the drug, the dopamine rush of getting a lot of likes.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:32.660]   So instead of talking about the death of civilians,
[02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:34.420]   they'll talk about beheaded babies
[02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:37.500]   or the equivalent of, they're going to actually
[02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:40.140]   make up stories because the made up stories
[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:41.860]   are going to be more viral.
[02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:45.020]   And so now we're just in this scene, this muck of lies.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:46.620]   - And there's a lot of people who actually
[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:47.980]   expose those lies on TikTok.
[02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:49.100]   So you have both.
[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:50.260]   You have both.
[02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:52.340]   And it's kind of like the democracy of the social media,
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:53.460]   as we always call it.
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.680]   But if you have the street-run media,
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.580]   that is the legacy media, CNN, BBC, New York Times,
[02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:00.060]   Fox News, all of those people,
[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:01.500]   and they are spreading lies,
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.660]   and they're not even doing their journalistic job
[02:24:04.660 --> 02:24:07.280]   in order to at least bring the other side.
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.340]   That's problematic.
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.900]   - And that's worse.
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:11.300]   You're supposed to be a journalist.
[02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:12.660]   - Yes.
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:14.460]   It's supposed to be a report.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:15.300]   Report!
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:16.580]   You know, report.
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:20.380]   - Yeah, but I see that this is like a catalyst,
[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:24.140]   an inspiration for the citizen journalist to rise up.
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:25.420]   - This is what you're doing.
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:26.380]   - Oh, this, yeah.
[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:27.340]   - This is what you're doing.
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:28.340]   No, this is what you're doing
[02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:29.720]   because you go into the deep dive.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:31.820]   This is like a no-filter thing.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:32.780]   There's no spin.
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:33.980]   - The long form.
[02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:35.600]   The long form is going to save us.
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:38.020]   (laughing)
[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:39.220]   - I see why you hate the TikToks,
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:40.380]   like a dopamine rush, you know?
[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:42.220]   - Stupid TikTok.
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:43.060]   Five hours later.
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:44.760]   - I saw the resentment in your face.
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:46.500]   (laughing)
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:48.080]   - I can't look away.
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:51.100]   - For like those 30 seconds, I do four hours.
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.340]   (laughing)
[02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:54.300]   - I mean, both have a place.
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:56.100]   Both are exciting, you know?
[02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:58.460]   But I can't, it is very dangerous.
[02:24:58.460 --> 02:25:00.100]   Like, you can't look away.
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:03.700]   And I almost never, maybe I'm doing it wrong,
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:06.580]   but I almost never feel better ever
[02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:08.520]   after having used TikTok.
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:09.360]   - Makes two of us.
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:11.360]   I can't, I cannot, I cannot.
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:12.200]   I have a team.
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:15.780]   By the way, I give my password to a team.
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:17.180]   I don't even go there
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:20.780]   because I went once in a dark night,
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:23.660]   very late at night, I went TikTok,
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:26.260]   and it was like two hours.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:27.820]   What? - Yeah.
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:28.940]   - What?
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:30.420]   I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:31.980]   "This is dangerous."
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:34.800]   I'm really like an Instagram and Facebook guy.
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:35.900]   I don't need that.
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:36.740]   - But even there, man.
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:38.100]   - And I barely get out of Twitter.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:40.300]   I mean, like X, I don't, I can't.
[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.980]   X is a cesspool, X.
[02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:45.880]   It's just like the concentrated hate in the X is too much.
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:47.060]   It's too much, I can't.
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:48.380]   - So you don't check it at all?
[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:49.580]   You try not to check it at all?
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:50.660]   It is very intense.
[02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:52.700]   - I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I can't, I can't.
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:55.000]   I just like, I post something and I run.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.100]   (laughing)
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:57.940]   - Post and ghost.
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:02.700]   So you're doing comedy here in the United States right now.
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:03.540]   - Yes.
[02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:05.780]   - Joe Rogan has the comedy Mothership,
[02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:07.180]   which is an incredible club.
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:08.980]   Have you considered doing that club?
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:09.820]   - I would love to.
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:10.800]   I mean, I--
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:11.700]   - Do you know Joe?
[02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:12.540]   - Of course, no.
[02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:13.820]   Who doesn't know Joe?
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:15.780]   - I feel like it's a small world of comedy.
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:16.740]   That's why I--
[02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:20.460]   - No, I think like Joe's story was like,
[02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:24.540]   what he did and stuff that he did in the UFC
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:28.620]   and his podcast and it just, it's very impressive.
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:31.660]   The fact that he's there and he's bringing
[02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:33.300]   all of those people, whether they're in comedy
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:34.700]   or in his podcast, it's very impressive.
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:38.180]   And this is what the media is all about,
[02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:39.900]   what is like the internet is all about,
[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:41.640]   to give you the experiences of stuff
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.940]   that you might never experience.
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:45.540]   And that is very important.
[02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:47.180]   I mean, you do it with people where like,
[02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:48.860]   you go into their brains.
[02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:51.260]   He goes take people and they take their experiences
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:52.860]   and their life and their story.
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:54.300]   It is very interesting.
[02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:57.460]   And this is the beauty of that art form
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:00.820]   because you have all of these experiences
[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:01.940]   at the tips of your hands
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:05.020]   and it is there for you to learn from, you know?
[02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:08.660]   And what he's doing, like when he moved to Texas
[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:10.340]   and we did the comedy mothership,
[02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:15.140]   anybody who would like push comedy forward,
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:16.940]   that is the most difficult art form
[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:18.100]   and the most demanding.
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:19.860]   And the fact that you do that,
[02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:21.820]   and he might not even be making money out of it,
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:23.620]   but he doing that because of his passion,
[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:24.580]   that is enough.
[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:28.500]   - Yeah, he really believes in creating this like
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:31.820]   place where comedians could be really free.
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.460]   And one of the cool things about the comedy mothership
[02:27:34.460 --> 02:27:36.900]   is like, comedian is king there.
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:39.780]   - Yeah, like there, we have to like,
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:41.660]   you have to bow down to the--
[02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:43.220]   - Because you know, the comedian who came there
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:44.900]   came after like eating shit.
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:45.740]   - Yeah, eating shit.
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:46.560]   - Dying out there.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:47.400]   - Everywhere else.
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:49.180]   - If you have basically, you're a saint.
[02:27:49.180 --> 02:27:50.940]   (laughing)
[02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:52.380]   - I have eaten shit for many years.
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:54.660]   (laughing)
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:56.060]   - Now I'm gonna give you shit.
[02:27:56.060 --> 02:27:57.140]   (laughing)
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:27:58.380]   - Ah, it's great.
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:00.260]   You already told me what you think
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:01.980]   about the state of politics in the United States,
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:03.980]   but now tell me what you really think.
[02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:05.980]   (laughing)
[02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:08.020]   What do you think of the choice of Trump versus Biden?
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:08.860]   How do we end up here?
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:09.700]   - I don't know, man.
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:11.700]   I mean, like the fact that like you have two people
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:14.420]   over the age of 90, it is--
[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:16.060]   - I think it's over 100, but that's all right.
[02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:19.180]   - It's all combined, like 170.
[02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:20.500]   It is so sad.
[02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:24.660]   It is so sad that this is what we can produce as a society.
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:31.220]   Like a demagogue and a sleepy Joe.
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:34.460]   I just, he's too, he's not there, man.
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:35.980]   He's gone, he's gone.
[02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:40.980]   I mean, he could, you know like when old people
[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:43.820]   could be like a danger for themselves?
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.260]   He's a danger for the whole world.
[02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:47.260]   I mean like the whole world.
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:50.060]   Like if an old person would die,
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:52.380]   he would like have like a hip replacement.
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:56.500]   We can need a new planet because of one decision.
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:57.420]   But it's not just that.
[02:28:57.420 --> 02:28:58.260]   It's not that.
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:03.260]   It's what are, when I came here, listen, I'm a Democrat.
[02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:06.100]   I always like, and I told you like,
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:07.620]   I vote for Bernie Sanders.
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:12.620]   I supported him like 2016, but I couldn't vote then.
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:15.780]   And of course, a huge fan of Obama.
[02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:19.060]   And one of my things is like,
[02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:20.820]   he's the first Muslim president.
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:21.660]   But he killed Muslims.
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:22.820]   Like ah, that's the things Muslims do.
[02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:23.660]   But anyways.
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:24.660]   (laughing)
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:25.580]   - I love that line.
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:27.860]   (laughing)
[02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:32.860]   - And it just, I think the whole idea, like my shock is,
[02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:39.460]   I told you about like what Biden said about like,
[02:29:39.460 --> 02:29:40.300]   I'm a Zionist.
[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:41.140]   Okay, we are Zionists.
[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:43.340]   But then like Jews are not safe in anywhere other than Israel.
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:46.100]   It's like, dude, what the hell are you saying?
[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:47.740]   And if you don't care about me,
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:49.540]   and you don't care about my misery,
[02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:54.140]   why would I care about you winning or losing, you know?
[02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:55.980]   And I have a joke that I told people.
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:59.180]   It's like, why would even Biden listen to us?
[02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:03.140]   He just raised $145 million in California alone
[02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:06.700]   from pro-Israeli groups.
[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:09.540]   I mean, what can we Arabs working
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:11.340]   in the vape business do to him?
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:13.580]   (laughing)
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:16.260]   It's like, we cannot compete with that.
[02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:20.180]   I mean, like practically, I mean, it's like life is unfair.
[02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:21.300]   The guy's a politician.
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:22.460]   He needs bills to pay.
[02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:23.980]   He needs a campaign to run.
[02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:25.180]   He needs money.
[02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:28.220]   He will go to the people who will give him money.
[02:30:28.220 --> 02:30:30.780]   Joe Biden is the highest paid politician
[02:30:30.780 --> 02:30:35.260]   from Israeli lobbyists, $4.6 million over the years.
[02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:38.300]   - Yeah, but I also believe in great leaders
[02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:40.140]   that go against all of that.
[02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:41.420]   But unfortunately--
[02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:42.980]   - Bernie Sanders was like that.
[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:47.180]   - Bernie Sanders, yes, but also age.
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.260]   I don't wanna be ageist.
[02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:49.100]   - Of course, no, no.
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.060]   - But even with like, 'cause I remember listening
[02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:55.940]   to Bernie Sanders 20 years ago on "Tom Hartman Show,"
[02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:58.940]   and I don't wanna say anything against Bernie,
[02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:00.780]   but like he was sharper then.
[02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:01.620]   - Of course.
[02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:02.620]   - There's a thing with age where--
[02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:03.460]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:07.500]   No, I think I'm a huge fan about like putting a limit
[02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:09.940]   on your working years because you don't wanna have
[02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:11.540]   like a Mitch McConnell moment every now
[02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:13.060]   and then because now the whole thing are like,
[02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:13.900]   what is this?
[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:16.660]   This is not like a house by scare home.
[02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:19.740]   It is unfair, it is unfair.
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:21.820]   And that the whole idea that you have like unlimited,
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:23.340]   like you have a limit for the president,
[02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:26.140]   but you don't have limit for Congress people and senators.
[02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:26.980]   What do you mean?
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:28.660]   This is basically, you can go in
[02:31:28.660 --> 02:31:31.660]   and be in governance forever.
[02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:33.580]   And you know, the longer that you can get,
[02:31:33.580 --> 02:31:35.060]   the more corrupt you will get.
[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:35.940]   - Yes.
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:38.980]   - And that is very concerning for Americans.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:41.580]   - Everybody, everybody becomes corrupt after a year.
[02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:44.380]   I mean, that's why two terms is a good limit.
[02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:45.380]   - For everybody.
[02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:48.540]   - Yeah, and you know, maybe half a term
[02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:51.340]   for Egyptian leaders happens.
[02:31:51.340 --> 02:31:53.580]   - Well, you know, our half term is 15 years.
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:55.220]   (laughing)
[02:31:55.220 --> 02:31:56.060]   - Quarter term.
[02:31:56.060 --> 02:32:01.060]   You should come back and run for office there.
[02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:03.940]   - Oh my God, no, no.
[02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:07.940]   There's a curse in Egyptian presidency.
[02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:10.860]   Nobody comes there, like is dead or in jail.
[02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:11.700]   - Yeah.
[02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.860]   - It's not the most appealing job.
[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:15.540]   - They might make a statue of you though,
[02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:16.580]   make you look good.
[02:32:16.580 --> 02:32:17.420]   - After my death?
[02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:18.900]   (laughing)
[02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:21.940]   I look, I look very good dead in a statue.
[02:32:21.940 --> 02:32:28.020]   - Yeah, when you look at what happened with Navalny,
[02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:34.420]   since you kind of really thought about this in Egypt,
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:37.540]   what happened with Navalny in Russia?
[02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:38.980]   What do you think about that?
[02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:40.580]   - Yeah, but what happened with Navalny in Russia
[02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:41.820]   is not something new in Russia.
[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:44.180]   I mean, Putin have like this whole history
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:45.580]   of poisoning and killing people.
[02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:47.420]   And it's kind of like pretty much,
[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:51.100]   I would have to set credit Putin,
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:53.580]   he's like bringing us the essence of the dark ages,
[02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:54.420]   the middle ages.
[02:32:54.420 --> 02:32:58.140]   It's like, you know, basically Putin is like,
[02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:00.060]   is the living example of what happens
[02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:01.780]   if Game of Thrones was reality.
[02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:03.100]   (laughing)
[02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:07.060]   It's like death by poison, like a blow up a plane.
[02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:09.100]   It's like mysteriously disappears.
[02:33:09.100 --> 02:33:14.100]   It is so, it is very dark, but it's like, wow.
[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:20.340]   It's like a, it's a television show.
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:23.580]   - Maybe that's what attracts us to that part of the world
[02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:25.620]   is that it's so much on display,
[02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:30.620]   this game of power, of geopolitics, of war.
[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:33.140]   - No, but the same happens in the West,
[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:34.420]   but I'm behind closed doors.
[02:33:34.420 --> 02:33:35.260]   It's not that open.
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:38.100]   It's not that pronounced, you know.
[02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:40.780]   It's like, oops, Epstein.
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:44.260]   (laughing)
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:45.100]   It's like, oh.
[02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:48.380]   We just like, I think, I think because of the West
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:50.500]   is more advanced, like in movies and cinemas,
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:52.300]   we kind of direct it better.
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:53.140]   - Yeah.
[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:54.300]   - I think the outcome is like the way
[02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:55.500]   that you kind of like set the scene.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:58.180]   It's like, scene and scene.
[02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:00.140]   - That's why people are all like landing on the moon.
[02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:00.980]   They're like.
[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:03.220]   (laughing)
[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:06.620]   - I get it, but you know, we haven't gone back.
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:08.540]   (laughing)
[02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:10.100]   - There's the flat, I mean.
[02:34:10.100 --> 02:34:12.660]   (laughing)
[02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:13.900]   - All right, if we zoom out,
[02:34:13.900 --> 02:34:17.660]   do you think there will always be war in the world?
[02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:18.500]   - Yeah.
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:19.320]   - Always be suffering?
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:20.160]   - Yes.
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:21.060]   - Yeah.
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:21.900]   - But here's the thing.
[02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:23.420]   I don't think for long.
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:25.180]   I don't think that will happen for long.
[02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:26.020]   - Wait a minute.
[02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:26.860]   - Yeah.
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:27.680]   - Yeah.
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:29.060]   - Because here's the thing.
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:31.380]   Humanity is destined to have war,
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:33.260]   especially, it will have war,
[02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:36.580]   but something happened in the last 50 years.
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:41.460]   We have had, now we have much more lethal weapons.
[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:43.340]   The problem is, in the beginning,
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:46.100]   it's like swords against swords, horses, cavalry,
[02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:48.260]   like cannons, catapults, mini-missiles,
[02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:49.380]   cheeky, cheeky, cheeky.
[02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:52.300]   But now we're like a press of a button.
[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:53.780]   You can annihilate the whole planet.
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:54.620]   - Yeah.
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:55.720]   - And this is the problem.
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:56.900]   Wars will always continue.
[02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:00.220]   The problem is when is gonna be the tipping point
[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:02.660]   where we are actually going to destroy ourselves?
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:04.940]   And it is so easy now to destroy ourselves.
[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:07.620]   The amount of weapons and the quality of weapons
[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:11.300]   that we have, it is designed to kill more effectively,
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:14.420]   more, it just, it is crazy.
[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:16.860]   It's like we can create our own destruction on ourself,
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:19.340]   and I think we're not that far away from it.
[02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:21.500]   - Just looking at nuclear weapons,
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.620]   the fascinating thing about nuclear weapons,
[02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:25.600]   as I've gotten to learn recently,
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:31.620]   just how few people are involved in a full-on nuclear war
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:35.300]   that kills, basically kills everybody.
[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:36.140]   - Yeah.
[02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:39.700]   - Well, three-plus-billion people right away.
[02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:43.220]   - And the consequences of the nuclear winter,
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:44.940]   it's unlivable.
[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:49.060]   - But all it takes is, I mean, one president can do it.
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:52.420]   So it could be even a false alarm, misunderstanding.
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:55.860]   - Like what happened in the Cuba missile crisis.
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:36:00.860]   - But again, and now there's more nations of progress,
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:04.200]   more nations are prepared and ready to launch.
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:05.040]   - Yeah.
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:06.960]   - I don't know.
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:09.920]   - And you have a media and a 24-hours kind of thing
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:13.200]   that makes you at edge the whole time, that's crazy.
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.280]   - There's a dark perspective on this
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:17.760]   where there's certain members of the media
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:22.200]   that would kind of enjoy the prospect of nuclear war,
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:26.400]   like a little bit, just let's get as close to it as possible.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:30.320]   - You have another factor that will contribute to that,
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.900]   religion.
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:38.980]   And remember how the radical Islamists talk about
[02:36:38.980 --> 02:36:40.020]   the end of time and whatever,
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:42.380]   but most of the Islamists don't have that much power.
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:43.800]   Problem is with Christian Zionists
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:45.740]   now being on the top of the world with America.
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:48.100]   They have been pushing for that kind of conflict
[02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:50.180]   to kind of escalate, escalate.
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:54.180]   Listen to Sarah Palin, it's like, "God wants us here."
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:57.560]   Like Karl Rove, all of the new gods.
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:36:59.800]   The dispensationalist Reagan.
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:01.160]   There's an incredible book called
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:03.360]   Forcing the Hands of Gods, beautiful book.
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.440]   I read it, it's like it's published 1998,
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:07.200]   but it still matters today.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:08.960]   The whole idea of what like,
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:11.960]   especially the Zionist Christians who love Israel,
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:14.240]   but they hate the Jews, they're anti-Semite,
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:16.260]   but they love Israel because of its role.
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:19.480]   This is all basically formed because of the interpretation
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:20.560]   of the Bible of Schofield
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:22.440]   and how they talk about the end of time,
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:25.200]   and then Armageddon, and then the late great planet Earth,
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:27.360]   and then left behind Sirius, and all of that.
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:30.400]   It's all about like, we're heading to Armageddon.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:32.640]   The problem is Islam has the people
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.480]   that believe that the end of time,
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:35.540]   and then we have the Christians
[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:36.520]   that believe in the end of time.
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:37.780]   And then you have Israel happy
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:40.000]   that those people are using it for the end of time.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.880]   And then the whole idea about them pushing as many weapons
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:46.240]   and troops and people in the Middle East
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:48.920]   to be there for the nuclear holocaust.
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:51.240]   And John Hagee, one of the pastors,
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:52.800]   talk about that, about the brimstones,
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:55.200]   and it's not gonna be a nuclear holocaust.
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:56.480]   All of that people.
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:59.640]   It's crazy how people are so despising life
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:01.100]   that they are wanting death.
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:04.600]   So now, you all would have these revelations,
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:05.960]   but these revelations mean nothing
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:07.280]   if you don't have an effective weapon
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:09.000]   in order to make it happen.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.680]   And this is the crazy thing.
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:14.180]   And I'm worried that the end is going to be by someone
[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:16.420]   that wants to meet God a little bit earlier.
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:22.120]   - Somebody who's really in a hurry.
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:25.600]   Well, I have good news for you.
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:28.760]   Maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species.
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:31.160]   - Maybe Elon Musk will lead us.
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:32.920]   - Lead the way to get out in space.
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:34.160]   - Maybe he's one of them.
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.860]   He's a secret lizard.
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:43.140]   - I asked you offline to not mention the lizard people.
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:44.920]   They are--
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:45.760]   - There's like a whole people
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:47.320]   that believe in the lizard people.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:48.160]   It's crazy.
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:49.080]   - Actually, I have to be honest.
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:51.120]   I haven't fully looked into the lizard people.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:51.960]   I probably should.
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:52.800]   - You should.
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:55.640]   - Yeah, well, maybe I'm afraid of the truth.
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:57.900]   (laughing)
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:03.380]   - Then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then.
[02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:04.220]   - The big reveal.
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:05.320]   - Removing my face.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:12.000]   - So let's say you're wrong about the end of the world.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:12.840]   - I hope so.
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:16.520]   - And we, it all turns out great.
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:18.140]   And humanity flourishes.
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:20.460]   Why would that happen?
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:25.460]   What gives you hope for that trajectory, for humanity?
[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:27.500]   - Younger people.
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:30.260]   The people of TikTok that you don't like.
[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:32.620]   (laughing)
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:35.900]   Yeah, there is a lot of like bullshit there.
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:37.740]   - You know, after you saying this,
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:39.600]   people just keep sending you TikTok videos.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:40.940]   These younger people, this.
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:43.380]   (laughing)
[02:39:43.380 --> 02:39:45.900]   - This woman showing her boobs, that woman.
[02:39:45.900 --> 02:39:46.740]   - That's gonna save us.
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.380]   That's gonna save us.
[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:50.700]   - All right, awesome, thank you.
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:55.700]   - No, there's like, I think there is a wealth of it.
[02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:58.300]   You know, I remember like the joke that said like,
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:00.100]   we thought that like when we have internet,
[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:04.140]   we're gonna have like be more, you know, more informed.
[02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:07.420]   And now we're watching twerking videos, and that is true.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:09.860]   But on the other side, the fact that you have
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:14.860]   the availability of information, I'm learning a lot.
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:18.300]   And there's people who are using that platform.
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:20.060]   It's not the majority because, you know,
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:22.900]   it's not very interesting and exciting.
[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:26.220]   But I think there might be a tipping point
[02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:28.980]   where there's enough people that will be aware.
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:33.020]   And maybe they would collectively do something
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:35.540]   in order to bring back the power to the small man.
[02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:40.020]   And maybe it sounds very naive, but we don't know.
[02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:43.600]   We don't know, because you have already seen
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:47.420]   the legacy media and the legacy politicians shaking
[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:48.380]   in the past few months.
[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:49.460]   - They're getting nervous.
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:50.660]   - They're getting nervous because people
[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:51.740]   are calling them out.
[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:53.620]   And those people who are like hiding behind their desks,
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:55.980]   behind in their offices, and not like holding out for that,
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:58.260]   but like people now are calling them out.
[02:40:58.260 --> 02:41:00.380]   And it is not gonna happen like this year or next year,
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:02.060]   but I think it's something.
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:03.860]   - What advice would you give to those young folks?
[02:41:03.860 --> 02:41:05.620]   - I will never give advice to those people.
[02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:07.820]   (laughing)
[02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:08.940]   - Get off TikTok.
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:10.140]   - I know, I will never, I will never,
[02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:12.500]   because like their input is different than mine.
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:14.940]   But like there's one thing I learned when people saw me,
[02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:16.780]   did the revolution fail in Egypt?
[02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:18.740]   Did people, that the people, it's like, listen,
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:19.880]   the revolution is not an event.
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:21.620]   It's not like, hey, we go in, we topple the government.
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:22.460]   It's not a revolution.
[02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:25.420]   A revolution is a process, it's a very long process.
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:29.060]   And maybe that process, I mean, as much as we don't like
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:31.520]   what happened in the Arab world, but the people there,
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.860]   the awareness that happened and the discussions
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:36.580]   that have been opened that you didn't even imagine
[02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:39.280]   what happened in the Middle East is happening.
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:43.560]   And maybe the beginning of any hope of change
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:47.080]   is that people start talking, speaking out,
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.300]   talking about stuff they were not allowed to speak about.
[02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:52.140]   Like, for example, Israel.
[02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:54.320]   (laughing)
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:56.700]   - The revolution continues, ah, yes.
[02:41:56.700 --> 02:42:00.360]   Bassem, you're a beautiful human being.
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:02.680]   It's truly a pleasure and honor to meet you.
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:05.700]   I could just feel the love radiating from you.
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:08.000]   I hope I get to see you perform live.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.200]   I hope to get to see you many more times.
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.680]   Thank you for being who you are.
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:13.600]   - Thank you so much, and I would love to invite you
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:16.140]   for my new special, "The Islamo-Nazi Bassem Youssef."
[02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:18.160]   (laughing)
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:21.120]   - That should be the title of your autobiography.
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:22.120]   Thank you so much.
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:23.720]   - Thank you, brother.
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:25.360]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:27.280]   with Bassem Youssef.
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.840]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:31.440]   in the description.
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:33.440]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:34.660]   from Jon Stewart.
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:38.240]   The press can hold this magnifying glass up
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:40.840]   to our problems, bringing them into focus,
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.520]   illuminating issues heretofore unseen,
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:47.740]   or they can use that magnifying glass
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:51.760]   to light ants on fire, and then perhaps host a week of shows
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.220]   on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous flaming ant epidemic.
[02:42:55.220 --> 02:43:00.200]   If we amplify everything, we hear nothing.
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:04.720]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:07.300]   (upbeat music)
[02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:09.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:19.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
