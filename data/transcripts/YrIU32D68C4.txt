[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - So begins a new week of episodes with John Piper
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.800]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.120]   Thanks for listening.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.880]   Pastor John, we have an email from a listener named Kai Tam.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.120]   Pastor John, how do you practically and lovingly
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.680]   lead your loved ones who are steeped
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.720]   in the prosperity gospel all their lives
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.520]   back to the true gospel?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.840]   I come from Malaysia and Singapore,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.480]   places immersed in prosperity gospel theology.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.320]   I understand that in 2 Timothy,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   Paul says there will come such days as these
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.720]   where people will gather for themselves
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.600]   teachers that suit their own passions.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.020]   But what if these are your close friends and family
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.800]   whom you love so much?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.080]   How do you teach or love or rebuke or reprove them?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.360]   I'm training for ministry in Melbourne.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.000]   One day I will go back to Singapore,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.720]   God willing to preach and pastor there.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.800]   And I know as Paul advised,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.440]   I should preach in every season
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160]   being ready to rebuke, reprove and exhort.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.880]   So what does this look like in a culture
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.080]   so steeped in the prosperity gospel?
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.080]   Just yesterday, I was writing an article
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.880]   about these days being the best of times
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.000]   and the worst of times.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.080]   And one of the evidences of it being the worst of times
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.000]   that I mentioned has to do
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.720]   with the so-called prosperity gospel.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.040]   I wrote, "I have watched the rise of enormous churches
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   and ministries who preach and export to poor nations
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.560]   a prosperity, quote, gospel, unquote,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.960]   that mutes the Bible teaching on suffering
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.920]   and reduces the glorious gospel to earthly betterment
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.680]   rooted in human attitudes, not the glory of Calvary."
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.000]   That was my sentence that I wrote down.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.640]   And there are three criticisms
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.440]   and I wanna just mention these
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   so that it can inform the counsel that I give to Kai.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.920]   Number one, downplaying the vast scriptural theology
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.960]   of suffering expected of Christians,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.120]   the suffering that's expected of Christians
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.400]   and promised to Christians like 1 Peter 4.19,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.720]   "Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.160]   entrust their souls to a faithful creator
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.560]   while doing good."
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.440]   So the prosperity gospel downplays
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.000]   this vast pervasive teaching in the Bible
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240]   that we're called upon to suffer.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.680]   And it's not just persecution suffering,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.880]   but body wasting away disease type suffering
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.520]   in Romans 8.23 and 2 Corinthians 4.16.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   So Christians in the prosperity churches
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.360]   are often profoundly unprepared
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.280]   for what life under God's providence is gonna deal them.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.120]   And that's tragic.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   And so it's right for Kai to feel jealous about his family,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.720]   that he can figure out a way to help them see these things.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.640]   And here's just one little sidebar.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.680]   My wife is going to Africa in a few weeks.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740]   Well, I think sometime this fall.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.260]   And she's going for the third time as part of a ministry
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.660]   to give wheelchairs to the disabled
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.660]   who can only crawl around or stay in their simple houses.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.220]   And a wheelchair changes the life of many.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.220]   And she made the point to me
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.980]   as I was talking to her about this the other day,
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.060]   that big prosperity ministries,
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.620]   as they're looking for partners there to help them,
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.300]   big prosperity ministries usually give little help
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.060]   because disabled people in a wheelchair
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.060]   are an embarrassment to their ministry.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.460]   They don't have a biblical theology of suffering
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.460]   and the fruit is not pretty.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.980]   So that's my first concern,
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.980]   the downplaying of a biblical theology of suffering
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   that would help people so much prepare
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.320]   for what necessarily must come in this life.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.960]   And the second thing is the prosperity gospel
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   reduces the glorious gospel to earthly betterment.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.040]   The dominant gift of the gospel in the New Testament
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.480]   is not earthly betterment.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   The dominant gift is the joy of reconciliation with God
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.600]   and eternal joys at His right hand forever
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.800]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.400]   Whether life in this age goes better here on earth
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.040]   is quite secondary to the New Testament way
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.200]   of looking at things.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.280]   There's gonna be a great day on a new earth
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   where everything is made glorious,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.640]   but that's not the immediate payoff of the gospel
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.280]   in front of everything else in the New Testament.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.520]   The biggest problem in the world
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.360]   is that God is angry at His creatures
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.520]   for rebelling against them.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.760]   And the central good of the good news
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.640]   is that in Christ, God took the initiative
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.000]   to satisfy that anger and make Himself our treasure
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.040]   and not our terror.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.880]   So prosperity preaching skews all that so badly
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.560]   by turning possible and secondary effects
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.320]   of the gospel into primary certain outcomes,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.560]   which they're not.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.280]   And the third problem that I see
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.880]   is that prosperity teachers distort
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.680]   the ground of our salvation
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.320]   by putting the emphasis on whether we can produce
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.420]   the kind of faith that gets healed and gets rich
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.360]   rather than putting it on the glorious work of Christ
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.760]   in dying and rising to bear the guilt of our sin
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.440]   and propitiate the wrath of God.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.120]   So what I would suggest to Kai
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   as he considers talking to his family about this
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   is number one, concede and celebrate
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.200]   that they are right to believe that God aims
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.480]   at the happiness and the health
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.760]   and the wealth of His children eventually.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.520]   God did not send Jesus into the world
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.220]   to make them eternally miserable, but eternally happy.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.000]   And to remove all tears from their eyes, Revelation 21, 4.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But raise the question with your family about timing.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.280]   Prosperity preachers get the timing of this all wrong.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.960]   Is all of that wonderful promise
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.840]   intended for now in this age in full?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.560]   Or does the Bible teach that God saves us in stages
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.800]   or phases and that this earthly walk
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.320]   between conversion and glorification
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.920]   is one of much suffering in the hope of glory?
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.760]   So my suggestion to Kai is that
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.500]   if he can tackle this with them,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.280]   make it an emphasis on timing,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.560]   not whether we will be eventually healthy,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.280]   wealthy, and happy in God.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.320]   And second thing I would suggest
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.600]   is talk to them about God Himself
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.960]   being our greatest treasure, not His gifts.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.680]   For example, "Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.060]   "And there's nothing on earth I desire besides you.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.500]   "My flesh and my heart may fail,
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.240]   "but God is the strength of my heart
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.960]   "and my portion forever," Psalm 73, 25.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.880]   And the text that Noelle and I used in our wedding,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.980]   she just called my attention to it the other day.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.980]   "Though the fig tree should not blossom,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.600]   "nor fruit be on the vines,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.400]   "the produce of the olive fail,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.980]   "the fields yield no food,
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.900]   "the flock be cut off from the fold,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.520]   "there be no herd in the stalls,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.080]   "yet I will rejoice in the Lord.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.240]   "I will take joy in the God of my salvation."
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.240]   That is so foreign to the mindset of prosperity preachers
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.360]   because of what is taken away in that verse
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.400]   and how joy abounds in that verse.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   And the third thing I would say to Kai
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.640]   is raise with your family
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.740]   the issue of how they can love those
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.980]   with permanent disabilities.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.620]   Are they embarrassed by them in their community?
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.500]   Or is it a sign of Christ's love that they care for them?
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.460]   And is it a sign of great faith
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.500]   that these people, while not healed,
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.740]   are rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.700]   rather than being miserable and angry at God?
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.340]   Isn't that glorious faith?
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.780]   And the fourth thing I would say
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.600]   is ask the family, ask them,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.820]   what they think of the promises of suffering in the Bible.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.520]   If they say, "Well, it's all persecution.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.260]   "We're not promised to suffer from sickness,"
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.220]   then point them to those texts
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.220]   which show that it includes the bodies wasting away.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:29.120]   Ask them about those texts.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   My sense is that the necessity of all suffering
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.140]   is minimized in prosperity preaching.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.840]   All suffering is minimized,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.240]   not just the necessity of persecution suffering.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   And fifth, share stories of great saints in history
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.160]   whom God used mightily and who suffered enormously.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   And sixth, as a means to these kinds of conversations,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.640]   ask your parents or brothers and sisters,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.080]   whoever you're having to deal with,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.000]   ask them for permission to talk about these things
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.040]   and set up a time when they're expecting it
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.920]   rather than being rushed or surprised by it
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.540]   and needing to be defensive.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.120]   I just think a lot of times we try to sow the seeds
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.960]   of our ideas on the spur of the moment
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.800]   and it's never quite the right time.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.520]   We just need to ask them permission
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.840]   to set up the right time.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.880]   And the last thing I would say to Kai is pray
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.700]   that God would give them eyes to see
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.700]   that there is great joy in suffering now
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.680]   and there will be great joy and prosperity at Christ's coming.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.520]   First Peter 4:13, rejoice insofar
