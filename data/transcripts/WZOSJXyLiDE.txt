[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Here's a question from the inbox.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.320]   Pastor John, when it comes to giving 10% of my income to a church, my tithe, can I split
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   the money and give, say, 5% to my church and 5% to a non-profit Christian ministry?
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.720]   What would you say about splitting the tithe?
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.880]   Well, my guess is that some of our listeners, as soon as they hear that question, would
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.400]   ask, "Do I even share the assumption that Christians have to tithe?"
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.840]   So let me start there.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.800]   No.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.080]   The tithe, 10% of your income, is not a "have to" in the New Testament.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.180]   The New Testament puts the life of the Christian on a new footing that is different from the
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.160]   Old Testament law.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:07.980]   Paul said in Romans 7, verse 6, "Now we are released from the law, having died to that
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:17.360]   which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, not the old way
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.740]   of the written code."
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.760]   So for example, when Paul gives instructions about how we should give, he never instructs
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.540]   us to lay aside a tithe.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.680]   He says things like, "Lay aside as each may prosper," 1 Corinthians 16.2.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.560]   And then he says in 2 Corinthians 8.3 that we should give according to our means, as
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.000]   I can testify, and they gave beyond their means of their own accord.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.960]   In 2 Corinthians 9.6 he describes the giving that God delights in, "Whoever sows sparingly
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   will reap sparingly; whoever sows bountifully will reap bountifully.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.240]   Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.800]   for God loves a cheerful giver."
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.560]   So the point is not that we be governed by percentages.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.320]   They're not mandated.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:39.840]   Rather, we should be governed by lavish, sacrificial generosity that overflows freely and joyfully.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.720]   So I've often said to my people over the years that a middle-class American who is only tithing
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.040]   is probably robbing God.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.600]   In other words, we have become so accustomed to our Western prosperity and its ways of
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.520]   life that we think 5 or 10 percent is generous.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:17.160]   Well, I hope it's clear when I say that tithing is not a "have to," not a New Testament rule.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.800]   I'm saying something like this.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.560]   Suppose a football coach does not say to his high school team, "Everybody must get up at
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.520]   five o'clock every morning and run three miles so as to be fit for the maximum effectiveness
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.280]   of this team."
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.960]   But instead the coach says, "I want you to love this sport with all your heart, and I
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.600]   want you to give it all you've got this season.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.960]   I want you to pursue maximum excellence and serve this team to make it as great as it
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   can be."
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:03.000]   Now, which of those two ways of talking to the team sets the higher standard?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.040]   The second way doesn't have any rules attached to it.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   The first one does.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.800]   "Up at five every day, three miles."
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.040]   Sounds pretty rigorous.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.360]   I think the second word from the coach is the higher standard.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.320]   It touches the heart of the team members.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:30.340]   And if any of them uses the absence of rules to justify half-hearted allegiance to the
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.880]   team, he's simply not following the heart of this coach.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.960]   And so it is with giving in the church.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.560]   Now, having said all that, the stage should be set to answer the question, "When we give
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.880]   of our resources to support the cause of the gospel, does God require that a certain percentage
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.520]   go to the local church?"
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.160]   And of course now, in view of all that we've seen, the answer is no.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.480]   The question is not decided by rules and percentages.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.640]   The question is decided by the largeness of your heart, the biblical centrality of the
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.820]   local church, and the wonderful value of other ministries.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.720]   So yes, I do think the local church has a unique and special place in God's plan, and
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.180]   therefore a special claim on the giving of its people.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.280]   Other kinds of ministries are wonderful, and I want them all to flourish.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   I'm involved in some.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:45.160]   But the one institution in the world that is clearly rooted in the New Testament and
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.500]   in the gospel is the local church.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.840]   If that institution fails, all other ministries become ineffective.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.880]   Indeed, if the church fails, all other ministries become unbiblical.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.600]   The church is the seedbed for ministries.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.280]   The church is the place where the participants in those ministries find their nourishment
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.960]   and the biblical expression of their corporate worship.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:22.720]   So I think it is a good rule of thumb—hear those words—I think it is a good rule of
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:31.880]   thumb to start your giving by tithing to the local church, and then giving over and above
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.840]   elsewhere.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.520]   But that's not a rule.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   That's not a rule.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.640]   It's not a mandate.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.320]   You can't say, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.200]   It's not a requirement.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.800]   It simply may be a helpful guideline.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.020]   And of course, I know there are wealthy people who can't begin to tithe to their local church,
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.120]   because their tithe would be bigger than the church's budget.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.280]   And so there are obvious exceptions like that.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.920]   But I prefer to put all the emphasis on, "Let's be lavish in our generosity.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   Let's be sacrificial in our giving.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:17.920]   Let's be loyal to our local church, and let's be far-seeing in our support for many ministries."
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.360]   I think God will handle the percentages.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   Yeah, amen.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
