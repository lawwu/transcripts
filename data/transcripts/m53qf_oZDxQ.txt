[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.760]   All right, moving on now, we have a question from Wei,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.680]   who says, how do I keep balance among a full-time job
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.360]   graduate school and teenage kids?
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   All right, so this is kind of similar to Nana's question
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.560]   from right before.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.440]   When you have a lot going on-- well, we just told Nana,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.640]   deep work is something to keep in mind.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.880]   The things that have to get done that are important,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.520]   do it with intense, unbroken concentration.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.480]   Do it well, but do it fast, and then move on.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.640]   Two, if you have a bunch of competing demands,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.840]   you have to give every minute of your day a job.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.720]   You cannot go through your day in the list-reactive method,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.400]   where you react to things like email and Slack
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.800]   and the internet and whatever is going on on Twitter,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.840]   where you discover that Donald Trump has just
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   selected Omicron as his running mate,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000]   and they're running on a platform that says,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.080]   your kids have to be infected or something.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.360]   You don't want to just be doing that, and then,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.600]   as you get around to it, looking at a to-do list
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.520]   and saying, do I want to do something from it?
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.800]   You have to give every minute of your day
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.960]   a job if you're going to make this possible.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.080]   And that's going to be something like time block planning.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.280]   Here's the hours I have.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.440]   Here's the meetings and classes I have.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.280]   All this time's off limits, like whatever,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.680]   I'm doing child care or something like that.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.400]   But here's where I actually have time to work.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760]   What do I want to do with that time to get the most out of it?
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.560]   I'm working on this here and that there and this here.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.280]   I'm going to be very clear about this way.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.080]   This does not mean that if you time block,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.320]   you'll be able to fit everything in and get everything done.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360]   Yes, time blocking is going to get you way more out
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.320]   of your time than if you don't.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.080]   But the other thing it's going to give you
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.480]   is a reality check.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.440]   It forces you to use a phrase from earlier
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.680]   episodes of this show.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.240]   It forces you to face the productivity dragon.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.960]   It forces you to actually see, here's what's on my plate
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   and how long it really takes.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.120]   I like to put down here, oh, do my email in 15 minutes,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.200]   but it takes me 90.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.280]   Got to face that reality.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.520]   I got to study for my class.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.280]   I give it 30 minutes between lunch and this other meeting.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.760]   I'm frazzled in that 30 minutes.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.640]   I never get it done.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.720]   OK, that needs a whole afternoon block.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.640]   And you see how long things really take, for better
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   or for worse.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.520]   But knowing what you're facing and how long it takes
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   allows you to be realistic.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520]   And there might be hard choices you have to face,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.480]   but at least you'll be making those hard choices
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.040]   from a really informed place.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.080]   You're going to be making those hard choices from,
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.280]   like, I know what's possible.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.440]   I know what things take.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.640]   I can get this and this done, but I
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.040]   can't do this at the same time as this.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.840]   Or I have to put this off.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   Going to have to quit this.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   You got to face the productivity dragon
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.240]   and then get as much out of the time that you can.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.960]   Time block planning is what you're going to have to do.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.160]   You're doing something hard.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.840]   Don't let anyone tell you it's not hard.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   And it might not be possible.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.040]   But there is no scenario in which
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   ignoring that reality, avoiding the productivity dragon,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.880]   just doing list reactive and being stressed,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.920]   there's no scenario in which that's
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.200]   going to be the best thing to do.
