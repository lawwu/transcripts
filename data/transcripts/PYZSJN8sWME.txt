[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   I have a chapter in my new book called Awaken to the Strangeness of Being Alive.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.300]   And it's about the fact that if you think about it, and how unlikely it is that we humans
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.800]   evolved at all, even that we even exist, all the bottlenecks in evolution that we had to
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.600]   pass through, including the disappearance of the dinosaurs and the emergence of mammals,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.720]   but there are 20 other huge bottlenecks throughout the history of evolution.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.640]   We had to pass through all of those.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.000]   We nearly went extinct 80,000 years ago from some virus that in fact, there were only 8,000
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.080]   people, humans on the planet, all these different things.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.560]   And here we are with Zoom meetings, etc, etc.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   It's like the strangest story you can ever, it's beyond science fiction, but nobody thinks
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.840]   about it.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.280]   Nobody sits down and goes, God, I'm alive.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.340]   If you went back to the chain of people that had to connect and have children leading up
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.320]   to your parents, the unlikeliness of you ever being born is astronomical.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.440]   I mean, unless my science is all wrong, 70,000 generations of people meeting, etc, etc, finally
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.340]   ending at your DNA, I mean, unless I'm missing something, it's pretty unlikely, but nobody
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.340]   thinks about it.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.560]   Well, I certainly think about it now because I almost died, I had nothing else to think
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   about.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.640]   I have to entertain my brain the way Milton Erickson had to entertain himself by observing
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.200]   people.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.800]   So it's taken a lot away from me.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.360]   I can't swim.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.800]   I'm riding my recumbent bike, which I love, and 80-year-old grandmothers are zipping by
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.800]   me.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.400]   God damn it, how awful, I'm so envious, I'm so, my insecurity is all well up.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.600]   But then I realize, hey, I'm on a boat, I'm sailing, it's wonderful, I'm outside.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   I have to go through these processes.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560]   But I think it's developed me in some way that's, in the end, very positive.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.400]   It sounds like you've had to adjust to a new frame rate on life.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.680]   The old movie had a certain frame rate, this movie has a certain frame rate, but that within
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.760]   that frame rate, there are gifts to be had that you certainly missed in your prior version
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760]   of self.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   Is that about right?
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   But also, like, I tell people this, I totally took my life for granted.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.920]   I was swimming all this time, I was fantastic, I was bicycling, I was traveling, but I never
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.640]   sat back and thought, wow, this is wonderful how grateful it is, it could be taken away
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   from me.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.040]   I tell people, don't do that to yourself.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.320]   I try and teach them.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.440]   It can be taken away from you tomorrow.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.020]   When you're out walking the dog, think of me, think of me that can't walk the dog and
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.400]   appreciate those things, which I didn't appreciate.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.720]   So I try and help people in that way when I can.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.520]   I think a critical message is also to inspire a sense of urgency in people.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.680]   I think people hear a sense of urgency and they go, oh, I'm already under so much pressure,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   life's so hard.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.580]   But we're not talking about a sense of urgency to take on more of what life has to offer.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.540]   I think we're talking about a sense of urgency to find one's purpose, which takes work and
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:27.400]   is an ongoing process, but to really get out of modes of apathy, laziness, languishing,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.540]   and to start, as you've described it, paying deeper attention.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.940]   I mean, this is a concept that was super important for me to hear about and I learned about it
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.600]   from you was, how do you get yourself out of a rut?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.180]   You start paying deeper attention to the things around you and inside you.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.640]   And perhaps not coincidentally, you referred to that as, quote, death ground.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.860]   - Yeah.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.160]   So it's a strategy from my book, I wrote a book on strategy, my version of the art of
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   war.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.440]   It's called 33 Strategies of War, but it's really about strategy, the strategic thinking.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.720]   It's inspired from Sun Tzu, the great Chinese strategist, but it has vast philosophical
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.400]   implications.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.460]   The idea is, you can almost think of it like barometric pressure.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.720]   When necessity is pressing in on you, like your back is against the wall, like you have
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.240]   to get something done, and there's like this pressure around you, you find energy in there
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.400]   that you never believed before.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.640]   William James talks about this when he talks about getting a second wind, he explains it
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.220]   very eloquently.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.360]   When you feel like your life's in danger, suddenly you can leap over things that you
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.640]   never could leap over before.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.140]   So Sun Tzu says, put an army on death ground and it will fight until it wins, meaning put
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.960]   an army with its back to the ocean or back to the mountain, and it's either win or die,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.940]   they're gonna fight 10 times harder.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.480]   You're gonna find the energy in you that you normally lack when death is facing you in
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   the face or urgency or deadlines or people pressing in on you.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.920]   When that barometric pressure loosens up and there's none of it, you think you have all
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.560]   the time in the world, you get nothing done.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.320]   Wow, man, I'm 23, I got all these years ahead of me, I'm gonna figure it out, right?
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.520]   I'm not gonna die, I got 50, 70, 80 years ahead of me.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.960]   No, you don't.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.060]   That pressure now is gone and you're wasting time, you're doing all sorts of things that
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.460]   aren't leading to any kind of skill, you're not learning or anything.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.080]   You need to put yourself on death ground, you need to feel that barometric pressure,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.160]   which is the actual reality.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.200]   The actual reality is you could die tomorrow, you could have a stroke tomorrow, you could
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.080]   be fired tomorrow, everything could fall apart.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.540]   You need to have that sense of urgency now because that's the reality.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.940]   You're fooling yourself by thinking you have all of this time.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.120]   And so when you feel that pressure, suddenly you can move mountains, you have energy, your
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.240]   life, you just have focus, et cetera.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.760]   Neurologically, everything clicks in.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.120]   And people who've had that experience where they've felt like the ship was going under
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.460]   and they better get their act together and survive, they talk about all these physical
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.620]   processes.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.480]   I have a story in my new book, I hope I'm not boring you with all this.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   No, quite the opposite.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:47.040]   About a mountain climber who, he was climbing this mountain by himself and he was having
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.360]   a great time but there was a storm coming and he had to get down and he suddenly fell
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.880]   and he cut his leg open massively and there was like a branch sticking in it and he broke
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   all these bones and he was going to die, he was on a ledge.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   He could see that it was getting dark and storm clouds were amassing, this was in the
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.200]   Rocky Mountains.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:17.720]   He was alone and suddenly he managed to get up on his two feet and he can't explain how
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.880]   but all of this energy, all this adrenaline started flowing in him and he said he was
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   like a mountain goat.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.720]   He was like going down the ledge, he jumped, he was able to kind of get down to another
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   ledge.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.760]   He got out of it and for the next 20 years, he was haunted by how did that happen?
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.240]   I want that feeling again because it was actually the most ecstatic feeling.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.360]   I had energy that I never suspected in myself and so he tries everything to get that feeling
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   back.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.720]   He tries climbing other mountains, he tries going to Mount Everest and it doesn't come
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.060]   back and finally he kind of figures out the formula for it and why it happened.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.020]   He studies a lot of neuroscience.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   It's a great book.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.020]   I'm using it in my new book.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:09.480]   It's called Bone Games, it's a very interesting book, a lot of science in it and he got the
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:18.640]   feeling back in a smaller sense but it was the feeling of your life is in danger, I better
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:25.120]   get my act together or it's the end and suddenly adrenaline, dopamine, all the other things
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.920]   were occurring in him and he found that energy.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.640]   That's the ultimate kind of death ground right there.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:42.160]   The human will to live is truly incredible and Sunai, I have to say, as I said before,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.560]   I'm so grateful that your stroke didn't take you out because clearly there's still so much
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:58.040]   in there and you're continuing to share what is really exquisitely useful knowledge.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   [Music]
