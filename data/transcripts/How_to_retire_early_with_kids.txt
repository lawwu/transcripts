[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about how to retire early with kids
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.700]   Because I truly believe it is nearly an
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.760]   impossible task
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.880]   I've talked about early retirement and financial independence since I started Financial Samurai in 2009 and that was when I didn't have kids and
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.040]   Then when I left in 2012, you know, I struggled here and there with trying to identify as an early retiree
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.340]   So I stopped and I did a lot of consulting work
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.720]   And I wrote on Financial Samurai and did it a lot of traveling and so forth
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.600]   But now that I've been a father for the past two and a half years
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.700]   I truly believe that retiring early without kids is like going for a walk in the park
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.100]   Maybe it's like getting a two or three hour Swedish massage the best massage you can ever have
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.120]   Retiring early without kids seems so easy now. I just wonder why don't more people get on board?
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.460]   There are absolutely various levels of difficulty for being able to retire early
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.060]   The easiest way to retire early is to have a working spouse
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.980]   If you got no kids to care for you're truly free to do whatever you want
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.520]   All you've got to do is keep encouraging your spouse to keep on providing while you kick back relax go play tennis
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200]   Drink some Mai Tais and just hang out with your girlfriends or guy friends
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.360]   And that is the best way and I know a lot of people who've done that and I even wrote a post about it called
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560]   How to convince your spouse to work longer so you can retire earlier
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.920]   It's a little bit far-schooled, but it's true. People are doing this all the time
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.900]   Another easy way to retire early is to be willing to live in or near poverty in retirement
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.200]   This is the definition of poverty according to the government the federal poverty level limit
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.340]   Ironically being willing to live like a monk is also one of the hardest hardest ways to stay retired
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.360]   Because you might start wondering what's the point of retiring early if you can't live it up with your free time
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.240]   If you got to count every single dollar in your wallet in your bank account
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.160]   Whether you can go to that movie during the middle of the day whether you can go out for drinks or whatnot
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.920]   So it's kind of hard. I believe to stay retired if you're living so spartanly a
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.620]   Much much harder early retirement achievement is to try to maintain the same standard of living in retirement
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.440]   Which you had while working without some budget sacrifices this route to early retirement is quite difficult
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.280]   nowadays
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.800]   Simple math suggests that it's hard to accumulate enough capital to sustain a middle-class lifestyle
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.320]   Because interest rates have fallen drastically
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   Yet just like proponents of the Roth IRA
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.720]   There are plenty of misguided people who think their investment income will be higher than their average working income. This is a near
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.600]   impossibility folks unless you're the best saver
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.720]   best investor in the world
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.520]   You are likely not going to be able to accumulate enough capital to generate as much as you did while you were working
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.840]   Do the math folks you now need two million dollars at a two percent interest rate to generate forty thousand dollars in income
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.680]   When in the past you only needed about a million dollars because the ten-year bond yield is at about one point seven percent
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.240]   It's under two percent
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.880]   So why is it so hard to retire early with kids?
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.140]   Well besides the cost the extra cost of raising children
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.220]   The main reason why it's so hard is due to them sucking up all your remaining time and energy outside of work
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:31.240]   Every early retiree I know spent hours outside of their day jobs finding ways to make more money to save and invest more
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.440]   Examples of what they've done include starting a blog on the side like I did creating online products
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.000]   driving for uber and lyft
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   coaching youth sports
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.200]   Pet-sitting consulting and freelancing buying rental properties and managing those terrible tenants
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.620]   Actively managing an investment portfolio to try to optimize it for dividend income going to business school part-time
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.060]   So you can earn more and helpfully get a promotion
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.640]   I used to spend 25 hours a week outside of full-time work writing on financial samurai. I wake up around 5 a.m. Or 6 a.m
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.640]   type for a couple hours go to work just get my face beat up and then maybe check my mobile phone for
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   30 minutes during lunch break and
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.860]   Then work some more and then come back and have the energy and passion to write more and do more online
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.320]   For another two or three hours and that went on and on until I finally left in 2012
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.360]   If I'd had adolescent children, then there's no way I'd have spent more than five hours a week on financial samurai
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.040]   Maybe nothing at all being away from my kid for 50 to 60 hours a week
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.240]   Would have made me feel even more guilty to work any longer at home
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.820]   Therefore, I probably would have devoted 70% of my time outside full-time work to my kids and wife
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:57.280]   20% with friends and playing sports and the remaining 10% to financial samurai or frankly probably more nap time
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.240]   I love napping and I would nap every single day if I could if I was working and actually I did
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.280]   During lunch break when I would go down to my car in the basement and take 20 minutes shut eye, but don't tell anybody
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.400]   So even though not having children while I was working is one of the top retirement regrets
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.520]   Having children while working would probably have delayed my retirement by at least 10 years
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.680]   If not 20 plus years because I know myself and I think having the goal to work until my kid graduates college
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.040]   Would have definitely been top of mind
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.200]   It's also hard to stay retired once kids come
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.240]   After we had a kid our already owner of
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:46.720]   $1,620 a month health care premiums jumped to $1,800 a month after our son was born for 2020 our health care premiums will rise to about
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.840]   $1,927 a month if we continue to only have one child we're talking over
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.000]   $30,000 a year in health care premiums alone and this does not include our deductibles and
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.440]   Copay out-of-pocket expenses capped at about sixty four hundred dollars
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.640]   Hope we never use them, but come on folks if we do use it
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   It's like thirty thousand dollars a year in health care premiums a year that that's just crazy
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.740]   We could try to and limit our household income to less than 400% of the federal poverty limit
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.580]   Which is eighty three thousand for a household of three to get health care subsidies
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.460]   But then we wouldn't have enough to comfortably live on
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:33.480]   Besides we would feel bad getting subsidies from the government when the purpose of the Affordable Care Act is to help those who are financially
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.900]   Struggling all my life since graduating from college
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.000]   I have aggressively paid into the tax system to support my fellow Americans, and I don't feel bad about it at all
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.240]   I've always been a contributor, and I want to continue that way so to go from being a contributor to
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.880]   Retiring early and then getting health care subsidies. It just wouldn't feel right
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.600]   In addition to higher health care premiums we obviously have extra expenses for diapers
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.000]   Clothes toys occasional babysitting to help keep our sanity and now he's in preschool and the tuition is
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.920]   $1,950 a month and there's probably two hundred dollars to five hundred dollars worth of other activities such as
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.160]   Fundraisers and donations and so forth that we have to pay as well
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.560]   We're hoping to send our son to public grade school because we find paying
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   30,000 to 45,000 a year in private grade school tuition to be
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.200]   absolutely ridiculous
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:35.560]   But the problem is San Francisco has a lottery system a public school lottery system for social engineering purposes
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.040]   It hasn't worked, but that's what our system is so even if you pay
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:47.760]   30,000 50,000 in SF property taxes your child has no guarantee of getting into your local neighborhood public school
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.400]   You could end up with your 10th choice 15th choice and have to drive 20 to 30 to 40 minutes across town
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.440]   And it just is a little bit ridiculous and it's another reason why we want to get out of here eventually
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.240]   So I've gone ahead and run the numbers in a detailed post on retiring off 200,000 a year in gross
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.920]   investment income for a family of three
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   $200,000 a year sounds like a lot
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:19.480]   But it really isn't if you live in an expensive coastal city in this budget, which you should click on the post to see
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.720]   You end up with about
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.260]   $1,400 in cash flow and that's not a lot
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:30.720]   So I guarantee you that this family living off 200,000 a year and it's not an outlandish budget at all
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.040]   We'll likely have to dip into
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.460]   Principle and that doesn't sound good. Now. You might look at the budget and think well
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.040]   $1,600 a month for food for three is unreasonable. Okay, let's cut that
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.720]   You might look at the budget and say 9600 annual vacation budget is unreasonable
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.560]   Okay, let's cut that. So let's cut five thousand to ten thousand a year from their budget
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.880]   Guess what if they have another child in other words a second child
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:05.920]   They are screwed. There is no way they can afford a second child on a two hundred thousand dollar a year investment income budget
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:13.280]   Well, they could but a lot of changes would have to be made now. Let's say you don't need two hundred thousand dollars
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.960]   You're like, well, that's just ridiculous
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.640]   I can take care of two children off two hundred thousand dollars a year easy because I'm gonna relocate to a lower cost a
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.520]   Living area and so forth. Well, let's just run the math
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.180]   Based on various returns or withdrawal rates. Here's how much capital you would need to generate
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.280]   $200,000 in investment income a year and
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   $200,000 a year in investment income
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.040]   So at 1.5% where the 10-year bond yield hit several months ago
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:48.000]   You would need thirteen point three million in capital or about six point seven million in capital
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.520]   to generate two hundred thousand and one hundred thousand at a 2% rate of return
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.280]   Ten million and five million at 3% six point seven million and three point three million at 4%
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:07.240]   Five million and two point five million at 5% four million and two million at a 6% withdrawal rate or rate of return
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.600]   You would need three point three million or one point seven million at 7%
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.240]   Two point eight five million or one point four three million and at 8%
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.520]   Two point five million and one point two five million
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.440]   That's a lot of millions folks with the median net worth for Americans under a hundred thousand dollars
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:33.400]   Coming up with 13 times to 135 times the median net worth in order to retire early with children is not very
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.680]   Realistic be realistic folks do the math look at your numbers
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.280]   If you are retired
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   You also likely have a much more
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.520]   conservative portfolio
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.320]   Because the last thing you want to do is get blown out of the water in terms of losing money in the markets and then having
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.480]   To go back to work and not spend time with your kids
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:59.560]   Therefore you've probably constructed a more conservative portfolio that might only generate closer to four to five percent a year if you're lucky
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:08.720]   Therefore you would reasonably and probably need closer to two to five million in order to retire early with kids in America
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.280]   During bull markets like one we are experiencing right now
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.880]   People tend to forget that stocks bonds and other risk assets sometimes decline in value the sequence of risk returns right right now
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.400]   It's like betting on black and hitting black ten times in a row in roulette
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.560]   You're eventually gonna lose and when it comes you're gonna suddenly have to rejigger your retirement investment model
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.480]   Alright now that I've deflated your spirits
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.080]   Here are some solutions I can think of if you still want to have your cake and eat it too
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.160]   Because having kids is really really wonderful
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.000]   But it is really really expensive and really really time-consuming
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.320]   So one make sure you pay yourself first
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.920]   No matter what don't let your desire to provide the absolute best of everything for your kids blow up your path to early retirement
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:05.200]   To relocate to a lower cost of living area instead of living in a city where the median priced home is over a million dollars
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:12.760]   Relocate to one of the hundreds of great cities across America where the median home price is closer to the national median of two hundred
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   $40,000 before you relocate though
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:24.080]   It's best to take a visit first to see if you will feel comfortable and included and it might not be as easy for some
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.600]   Groups of people than others. Let's be honest
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:34.560]   Three consider joining the military foreign service law enforcement or any organization that provides a pension
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.440]   You know teachers get pensions too if you join between 18 to 22 years old
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.080]   You can retire as early as 38 to 42 with a pension
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.800]   Even if you work for 10 more years to get a bigger pension, you can still retire much earlier than 60
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.920]   I truly believe joining, you know
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.680]   A service industry is really one of the most underrated things you can do because that pension is worth
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.960]   Gold, I mean it is so valuable. It blows the private sector benefits out of the water
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.720]   For send your kids to public grade school only unless your kid has a scholarship or you are rich
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.520]   In other words income of at least five to ten times the annual cost of annual private school tuition
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:22.380]   Private school tuition is a huge financial drag the amount you could spend on your kid once they're in private school is endless
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:29.340]   Because you will be forever pressured by other parents richer parents and also by the kid to spend and donate more
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.040]   Five make yourself feel better about not sending your kids to private school by selectively reading
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.480]   Perspectives from parents who sent their kids to private school and regretted their decisions
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   You know not all private school kids go on to great universities and do great things
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.460]   A lot of them end up just like regular folks or worse
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.320]   Then read up about all the great Americans who went to public school and did just fine
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:01.880]   Six encourage your kids to help out around the house more to not only save money, but also build their character as well
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.640]   Making kids consistently work for what they think they deserve is one of the greatest life
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:14.720]   lessons seven swallow your pride and start accepting health care subsidies intended for the
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:22.120]   Financially struggling to do so you may have to rejigger your portfolio to produce less income and focus more on capital appreciation
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   To make yourself feel better about taking instead of giving
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.980]   Look into all the ways other Americans have succeeded by taking advantage of the system
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.360]   Also, tell yourself that you've already paid into the system while working so it's time to get yours
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:44.560]   Next keep the fact that you're taking health care subsidies from the government a secret from your children
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:51.440]   Otherwise your children might grow up to be entitled and spoiled and decide to leech off you when they are adults for the rest of
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.680]   their lives
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.760]   Next negotiate a severance given pensions are rare for early retirees
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.080]   It's only logical to try and negotiate your own pension through a severance
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.120]   There is no downside to trying given you plan on leaving anyway without my severance
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.560]   I probably would have worked for at least another five more years
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:18.720]   Next if you're feeling the financial strains of early retirement make your spouse go back to work leave the house
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.480]   Even though having one working spouse and one stay-at-home spouse is not considered being early retiree
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.880]   Sometimes it's worth being selfish and delusional for your own sanity and just tell yourself
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:37.320]   Hey, I'm an early retiree because my spouse works even though I live off her health insurance and all that good stuff
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.280]   Once you have a working spouse life is kind of easy, you know health care and expense
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.000]   Yeah, it's subsidized by the employer by on average 71%
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.100]   Also a working spouse can also greatly reduce the amount of capital needed to produce early retirement income
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:59.080]   And finally number 11 if you don't wish to fool yourself into thinking you're retired while your spouse works
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.600]   Then take on some part-time work to supplement your income
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.800]   I found that working about 20 hours a week is the optimal amount of time for intellectual stimulation
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:15.040]   Earning an active income is rewarding if you can do so in moderation and with autonomy
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:22.080]   Autonomy is the key here folks when someone's telling you what to do for 20 hours a week. That just doesn't feel great
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.360]   So although life is short life is also very long
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.040]   Don't feel like you have to retire ASAP just because you saw someone else online retire early
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.980]   You're suffering from the classic new car in your neighbor's driveway envy syndrome
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.600]   Each year you delay retirement is one less year
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.200]   You have to pay for retirement and one more year you can save for retirement
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.040]   Before negotiating severance consider taking an easier at your job for one year to see how things go
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.360]   Maybe take a sabbatical as well
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   Take all your vacation days definitely
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.680]   Utilize the full hour for lunch get back to your boss a little later than normal and leave right at 5 p.m
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.200]   Let's see if life might be a little bit better
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:08.320]   If you didn't pressure yourself so much to work so hard to outperform your peers to get that raise in promotion
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.680]   By grinding less hard you might just start enjoying work a little bit more
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:19.280]   Further each additional year you work will add to your potential severance check when you finally walk away
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.920]   The severance calculation is generally one to three weeks of severance per year worked
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:31.120]   In conclusion, I say having kids is worthwhile. They're the best thing ever that will happen to you
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:38.040]   But they also put a tremendous strain on your finances. So make sure you put on your oxygen mask first
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.800]   Thanks so much everyone
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:46.720]   I'd love to hear from you how you plan to achieve financial independence with kids or how you did achieve financial independence with kids
