[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   Today, I want to share the most underrated hack for your health.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.600]   It's easy, it's totally free, and it helps with everything from immunity
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.040]   to sleep to sickness, asthma, anxiety and more.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.920]   And you might think I'm talking about exercise or a healthy diet, but I am not.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.120]   I'm talking about something
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.240]   the majority of us have been doing wrong for most of our lives, breathing.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.800]   And we're going to walk through exactly what you can do to fix it
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.520]   and transform your health.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.840]   If you are breathing improperly, you are denying yourself oxygen.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.240]   You are making your heart work harder.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.360]   You are increasing your chances of having respiratory disorders.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.760]   It's a disaster for your health.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.160]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and this is All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.760]   your life, money and travel.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960]   Today, we're talking with James Nestor, the bestselling author of Breath
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.200]   and world-renowned expert on this topic.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.960]   Do you think the average person even knows if they're a mouth or a nose breather?
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.240]   No, I don't think they do.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.680]   And a lot of people will deny it.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.720]   If you go into your kid's room at night, if you see them breathing
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.360]   with an open mouth, if they are holding their breath, if they are snoring.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.880]   These are serious warning signs.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600]   And if you don't do anything about it, we know that this directly leads
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.680]   to developmental problems in the brain and in the body.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.600]   You can change your airway.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.160]   If we've made ourselves sick, we can make ourselves healthy again.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.800]   How quickly would someone start to see some impact of doing this?
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   30 seconds, if you think I'm joking.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.160]   Let's go fix our breathing with James Nestor.

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.240]   Let's get into it.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.520]   James, thanks for being here.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.840]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.160]   I want to start humans.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.680]   Why do you think we are the worst breathers in the animal kingdom?
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.840]   What are we doing wrong?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.920]   I won't tell you why I think we are the worst breathers.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.360]   I will tell you why we are the worst breathers.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.480]   So there's a number of different things.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   I'll start with the most obvious.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.960]   And to me, it was the most revelatory thing.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.640]   The fact that our faces have changed, our mouths have changed.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.040]   Our airways have changed.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.320]   Our sinus cavities have changed in the past around 300 to 400 years.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.120]   And this has been caused by industrialized food.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.200]   We don't chew and everything shrunk, which is why we have crooked teeth.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.160]   And with crooked teeth, you have a smaller mouth, smaller mouth,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   smaller airway breathing problems.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.040]   But that's the first of a multifaceted
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.000]   series of reasons why we are such terrible breathers.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.560]   And what's the impact of all this?
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.760]   Right. We could talk about how we could get better and what we're doing wrong.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.800]   But why should people care about solving this problem?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.840]   If you're breathing improperly, you are denying yourself oxygen.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.720]   So it makes it harder for your body to process oxygen.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   You are making your heart work harder, which leads to hypertension.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.320]   Other issues, you are making it harder for your brain to focus
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.080]   and to make decisions.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.680]   You are increasing your chances of having respiratory disorders.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.800]   You are increasing your chances of having anxiety and panic.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.120]   I can keep going.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.400]   Yeah, I mean, so it's a it's a disaster for your health.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.920]   If you were to eat bad food, it's very bad for your health, right?
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.360]   That's very obvious.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.400]   If you sleep poorly, it's bad for your health, right?
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.960]   But people don't realize that if you breathe poorly,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.560]   if you are constantly suffering from even a slight dysfunction
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.080]   in your breathing, it's going to impact you
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.960]   and it impacts you in so many different ways. OK. And.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.840]   You talked about how we've evolved from food.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.400]   Obviously, we can't go as individuals back in time and change evolution.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   But how much of the way we breathe and the issues we might have from it
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.600]   are things we can actually change and correct?
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.720]   The vast majority. You can change your airway.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.200]   You can change your mouth size.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.520]   You can change the bone density in your face.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.760]   So you can change all of these things.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.360]   If we've made ourselves sick, we can make ourselves healthy again.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.320]   I've read the book.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.360]   I've listened to a few talks you've given.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.400]   Sounds like a big culprit is where, you know, the passage
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.040]   we're breathing through, whether it's our mouth or our nose.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.960]   Is that the place to start?
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.080]   It is. It's the most boring place to start.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.520]   And nobody wants to do this.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.200]   Everyone wants to go to breathwear classes and, you know, put on white clothes
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.400]   and put on some some necklaces, you know, and do that thing.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.240]   And that's great.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   But you have to start with the simple stuff.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.400]   You have to start with the foundation and then build up from there.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.000]   And the foundation, the number one thing is to become a nasal breather.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.440]   And if you don't do that, I don't think you can ever be healthy.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.440]   Across all forms of health.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.560]   Yeah, I don't think you can.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.400]   I am I am more sure of this now than I ever was.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   I don't know if I would have said that like seven years ago.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.160]   But the more people I talk to, the more research I do,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.880]   the more I'm convinced that if you are not an obligate nasal breather,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.600]   you can never be healthy.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.480]   And how many people, if you had to ballpark in the population,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.680]   are not nasal breathers? It depends.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.160]   So at night, around 60% of us breathe through the mouth, 60 to 65%.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.640]   So in the daytime, kids are the worst culprits.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.560]   They're the worst breathers.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.720]   So up to 50% and sometimes a little higher than that,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560]   sometimes a little lower, depending on the survey or the study.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.120]   But it's about half of the population.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640]   And so you have to start with that.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.920]   And how do you even diagnose yourself? Right.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.000]   How do I I've been thinking about this interview and trying to be self-aware.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But do you think the average person even knows if they're a mouth or a nose
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.920]   breather? No, I don't think they do.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.960]   And a lot of people will deny it, even if they are.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.520]   So you have to, first of all, be interested enough
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.720]   to want to do something, to diagnose yourself.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.520]   Then you have to be interested enough to treat yourself.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.680]   How many people are interested in that? I don't know.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.600]   And that's not my job, is to try to convince someone to do something.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.320]   I'm here to give you the facts of what I've learned along this journey
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.440]   of researching all of this stuff.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.360]   So one thing you can do in the daytime is set an alarm,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.240]   maybe four alarms per day.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.320]   When that alarm goes off, take notice of how you're breathing in that moment.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.640]   Are you breathing into the chest?
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080]   Are you breathing through your mouth?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.960]   Another thing you can do at night is this little controversial
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.440]   is to try using a little piece of tape at night.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.920]   And if that's very uncomfortable,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.840]   then there's a very good chance you're a mouth breather at night.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   If you wake up with a dry mouth all the time, if you're peeing
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   throughout the night, if you snore or if you have sleep apnea,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.720]   the very high chance you have a mouth breathing.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   I did an episode once with someone who suggested trying to use mouth tape
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.080]   and someone, a company called Hostage Tape was listening and sent me hostage.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.920]   I was like, well, I might as well try it.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.440]   And for anyone listening, I would say
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.920]   it sounds a lot more daunting than it is as an experiment.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.000]   I don't know if you've had people.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.880]   I think a lot of people think, especially with a name like hostage tape,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.040]   like this could be like a very stressful night's sleep.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.080]   Is that what you've seen from people trying it out for the first time?
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.680]   Yeah, I think that's the wrong message to send.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.200]   They sent me a bunch of crap, too, and then started using my clips all over.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   Anyway, cease and desist.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.760]   So beyond hostage tape, there are many ways to do this.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.680]   You don't have to buy a particular brand.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.200]   You can use any surgical tape, micropore tape.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.360]   Don't use duct tape or scotch tape or anything like that.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.560]   You want to find a tape that's designed to be put on skin
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.120]   and you want to take some of the adhesive off.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.400]   So this is not hermetically sealing your mouth shut like a hostage situation.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.920]   This is a reminder, just a little piece of tape, a reminder to keep your mouth shut.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.760]   That's all it is.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.960]   And at any time it comes right off.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.120]   That's why I don't think it's dangerous, even though you still hear
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.240]   ENTs and dentists and doctors saying, you know, putting your life
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.920]   in your own hands by wearing this teeny piece of tape over your mouth at night.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.760]   I think you're putting your life in your own hands if you're suffering
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.400]   from mouth breathing and snoring all night and suffering from sleep apnea.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.440]   They're not talking about that part.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.520]   Yeah. And I've even found that you can kind of breathe
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.960]   through your mouth anyways, if you really try, like stretch it just a little.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.360]   Hundred percent. Yeah, it's not very daunting.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.720]   I was surprised my wife and I tried it.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.600]   She if I remember correctly, this was a couple of years ago.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.080]   She found it more uncomfortable than I did, which I guess maybe means
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.320]   maybe I'm more naturally a a nasal breather than she was.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.880]   But it was a good a good experiment.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.160]   Well, it sucks for the first couple of weeks.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.400]   And that's why most people give up.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.480]   Right. They try it a couple of nights and it's terrible.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.280]   And then they move on to something else.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.000]   But just like most things, once you acclimate to it, you get used to it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.480]   It gets much easier.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.760]   So I have a hard time sleeping without it now.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.360]   So I'm the guy in a downtown hotel
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.640]   who forgot to pack it, who's walking the streets at night,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.400]   you know, looking for Walgreens, looking for some sleep tape
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.760]   because it makes such a difference to my sleep.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   And I track my sleep so I can see it.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.120]   And that's even even though you've learned to be a nasal breather,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.640]   even just having it at night helps.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   It's not it's maybe something that you can't just train yourself
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.760]   to always sleep through your breathing through your nose without it.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.440]   Some people can.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.160]   I'm not one of those lucky people.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.040]   I don't want to use this stuff, to be clear, OK?
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.160]   This is not something I want to have to pack
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.600]   in all my different suitcases and and, you know, carry ons.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.520]   But it's something that I need and I have tried to sleep without it.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.120]   And whenever I do, I just have the facial structure
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.520]   that when I put my head back, my mouth is open.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.000]   So I think I'm sort of screwed and I'm stuck with this stuff
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.760]   the rest of my life.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.400]   But it makes such a huge difference to my sleep quality
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.640]   and so many other facets of my health that I'm going to continue doing it.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.840]   And, you know, that's one place to start.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.160]   But I think you said your oral posture might be another place
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.240]   to start thinking about this.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.800]   I imagine the average person listening has no idea what oral posture even is.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.360]   No, I didn't until a few years ago.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.160]   So this is this concept where there is a proper way
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.560]   in which you should be holding your tongue in your mouth
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.880]   and a proper way in which your teeth should be a certain amount of distance
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.800]   between your back molars and your lips should always be shut.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.120]   I didn't know anything about this.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.800]   I thought this was fine posture, you know, for for your mouth.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   But it turns out that when you hold your tongue to the roof of your mouth,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.240]   this helps expand the palate, especially when you're younger,
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.200]   helps expand the face, helps expand the airway.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.520]   So that's all good stuff and helps expand the sinuses as well.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.800]   You have your lips lightly touching in your teeth,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.040]   about two millimeters of space beyond in the back.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   I know it sounds very complicated, but it's not.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.400]   You notice what happens to your airway when you do this.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.960]   Your airway is open.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.200]   You're relaxed in ancient Qi Gong.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.920]   They thought that this was the channel that helped keep Qi inside of your body.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.400]   So if you want to go mystical, you can believe that.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.120]   But biologically, as far as how we are holding our tongue and our mouth,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.040]   this is the most beneficial to breathing and the most relaxing to.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.280]   Wow. And so is that just something to practice,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.840]   just sitting and kind of rewind about 60 seconds,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.760]   listen to that a few times and kind of lock it in as as a default posture?
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.600]   Yeah, it's so sad that we have to learn how to practice
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   some how to have natural mouth posture.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.480]   But we do just like we have to learn how to practice how to eat again and exercise.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.560]   So once you get it down, it's quite easy.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.120]   But just like most habits, it can take a few weeks to really train yourself.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.640]   So set little reminders when you're walking.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.160]   Always do this as well. OK.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.960]   And what about chewing?
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.000]   You said the food we've eaten has had a huge impact.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.160]   Should we be eating differently?
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160]   Well, yeah, maybe.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.480]   Have you been to an airport lately?
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.680]   Yeah, we should be eating differently for a whole whole number of different reasons.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   But one of which that people just aren't talking
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.560]   about too much is chewing stress.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.320]   We need chewing stress.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.840]   OK, we used to chew for about two to three hours a day every single day,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.480]   which is why our jaws were enormous.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   Our airways were huge and our sinus cavities were huge.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.920]   We don't do that now.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.320]   So even with healthy food, you think about healthy food,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.160]   yogurt, avocados, these are all foods I love, smoothies.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.400]   There's zero chewing now.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.120]   And so it's especially important for kids.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.720]   Kids were weaned from breastfeeding to hard foods.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.280]   Now they're weaned from a bottle to soft foods, to applesauce.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.920]   So there's no chewing stress.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.800]   They don't develop the proper skeletal or musculature,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.360]   which is why they have a certain facial growth.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.200]   And that facial growth is not conducive to healthy breathing.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.960]   How early does this kind of get set in?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.680]   I'm thinking as someone with a one and a three year old, is it,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.240]   you know, now seems to be prime time.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's prime time.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.800]   You know, our ancestors and just to be super clear,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.960]   because I've gotten a lot of pushback from so many people on this.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.080]   I'm not telling people what to do, and I'm not shaming anyone for doing anything.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.480]   I'm just telling you what what I have learned, OK?
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.400]   Our ancestors, we used to be breastfed for a minimum of three years
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.720]   and in some cultures, four years, five years, six years, right?
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.680]   When you are breastfeeding a kid, it pulls the face out, OK?
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.440]   They develop proper nasal breathing because they can't breathe
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.560]   if they're not breathing through their noses, right?
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.400]   Yeah. Breastfeeding for a long time.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.600]   And they're doing this.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   How many times a day?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.520]   Eight times a day when they're when they're very young, 10 times a day.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   So this develops proper oral posture.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.000]   Nasal breathing from the get go helps pull the face open.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.240]   And I realize we live in a modern world that is not possible
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.440]   for a lot of modern mothers, which is completely fine.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.680]   But when you wean a kid from a bottle
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   and you wean them onto soft food, still, they're not getting that chewing stress.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.920]   So this whole concept of baby led weaning, I think, makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   Like none of us would be around if our ancestors
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.400]   didn't chew hard foods when they were infants, because that's all there was.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.160]   Right. They were given adult food like right from the get go.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.120]   So this concept that you can only feed a baby Gerber's,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.440]   you know, it's just not based on any real science.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   So it's it's most important earlier on for chewing.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.880]   But it still makes a difference when when you're older,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.840]   because when you chew, you help tone the airway.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.720]   And when you don't chew, that airway can get flabby,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   you know, can get out of shape just like any other part of your body,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.760]   which makes it more apt to
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.240]   cause problems when you're breathing.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.720]   Are there some foods that are just great things to add to your weekly rotation
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.920]   that they really give you a good exercise?
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.400]   Well, it depends if you're a keto person or a vegan person.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.160]   And I'm going to get in trouble here to eat a carrot.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.360]   Carrots are great, unless you're a keto person.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.040]   Celery. I think that is keto friendly.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.560]   If you're a keto person, eat some meat, things that I mean,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.480]   just think about all the foods that we used to eat.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.720]   They required the vast majority required chewing.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.600]   So it doesn't need to be that complicated for some people without TMJ issues.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.400]   Gum works really well. Right.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.600]   So you can chew gum for a couple of hours a day.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.160]   Hard gum, sugar free gum, no aspartame.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.040]   OK, like chew the stuff that tastes like crap that is really hard.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.160]   And that can have a lot of benefits to help toning up that airway.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.800]   We don't need to promote specific brands, but are there.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.920]   What does someone look for for a hard, bad tasting gum?
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.840]   I can't even imagine finding one at the store.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.080]   It would be from this Turkish gum called Felim.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.960]   It's available on Amazon.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.160]   It tastes awful.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.840]   They have flavors like grass and carbonate.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.600]   And that's the stuff I get because it's rock hard.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.320]   There's no sugar, no artificial sweeteners or colors.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.360]   And you can just chew it and you get a really good workout from it.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.440]   So you don't have to chew that.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.360]   There's also mastic gum, which comes from a tree in Greece
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.960]   and the Mediterranean and people like that as well.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.400]   And it's really hard.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.440]   Gives you a good workout.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.480]   But as I told you, if you have TMJ issues and a lot of people do,
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.680]   this is not good, this hard chewing, you have to get that taken care of.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.880]   What about I'm thinking as a kid, I had braces, I did Invisalign.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.560]   Are those things helpful towards breathing or are they helpful
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.040]   towards visual appeal and actually are setting us back for breathing?
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.000]   Well, another controversial subject, I'll tell you, two schools of thought.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.360]   So Dennis working today say, you know, we're straightening your teeth.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.720]   You should be happy about everything's fine.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.360]   A lot of the dentists I've been talking to for a long time,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.320]   and I would say about 50% have told me that all of these things that I had done
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.880]   extractions, braces, headgear, retainers, what they do, it's like foot binding,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.960]   like the ancient art of foot binding.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.600]   You take a kid's mouth that's too small for his face
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.880]   because his teeth are crooked, right?
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.760]   And you remove teeth and then you crane the remaining teeth back
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.040]   and let the rest of the head grow.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.880]   What's going to happen?
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.400]   You're going to change the kid's profile.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.720]   You're also going to inhibit their airway growth.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.080]   And so many dentists are saying this is one of the primary reasons
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.000]   so many people are suffering from breathing problems
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.160]   because their airways have been constricted.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.920]   Their jaws are set back like this because they were bound
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.240]   at when kids were 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 when they're having these crazy growth spurts.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.600]   So I think in 10 years, at least the vibe I'm getting is none of the stuff
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.880]   that we had done is going to be done to kids because of lawsuits.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.520]   And it's already starting.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.720]   Yeah, it felt almost like a factory as a kid.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.440]   You go to the orthodontist, there's 15 chairs around there.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.320]   Everyone's getting stuff.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.560]   That's what that's what it was.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.440]   They weren't looking at the individual.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.640]   They weren't designing this for your face or for the airway at all.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.840]   They had one goal.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.120]   Straighten this kid's teeth at any cost, at any cost to their mouth.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.400]   Their airway, the rest of their face.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.760]   And that's what they did.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.600]   And this all came about in the 1940s, this production line dentistry.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.320]   It was never done this way.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.280]   They used to expand kids mouths because makes sense.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.160]   Mouths too small. Teeth crooked.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.400]   Let's expand the mouth. Teeth growing straight.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.840]   Face develops the proper form.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.480]   Airway stays open.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.840]   It's harder to do that.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.960]   And it costs more money.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.840]   So why not get hundreds of thousands of kids, line them up
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.880]   and do the same thing over and over?
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.360]   So I know Dennis out there might be cringing at this right now.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.680]   I'm not arguing for one way or the other.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.080]   I'm telling you what I've learned from Dennis.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.000]   I've spoken at a lot of 88 conferences as well.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.400]   So all this is changing right now.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.640]   And those dentists who maybe would advocate
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.040]   not doing what we went through as kids, would they say,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.520]   just leave the teeth crooked or would they say, do something to expand
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.400]   that might cost more, but have a better impact?
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.120]   They would expand them.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.200]   Yeah, they wouldn't say leave the teeth crooked.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.000]   No, not at all, because that's not good for how you look.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.960]   It's not good for chewing. Right.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   The mouth, that's a sign that your mouth is too small.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:19.640]   So you need to make your mouth larger, not smaller by extracting teeth.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.920]   And so if you just look at the math of that, like
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   and I have no experience in dentistry, it makes perfect sense to me. Right.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.120]   And then you realize about half the dentists are now starting to fly this flag
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.760]   and the other half are defending what they've done for the past few decades.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.040]   But it's really starting to crumble.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.760]   Who knew we'd be talking about dentistry here?
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.560]   It was a small bullet on on things I wanted to hit on.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.760]   But OK, so that's a lot of anything else on the mouth.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.720]   We should be doing other.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.600]   So we could work on chewing, work on exercises, work on being more aware,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.560]   breathing through our nose, potentially taping our mouth.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.600]   Are there things I'm missing?
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.280]   Yes, there's a few.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.680]   There are specific exercises for your mouth, and I know this sounds ridiculous,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.400]   but these exercises, especially for kids, can be so beneficial.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.040]   The same way you would exercise your biceps, your legs or your abs.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.120]   You exercise your mouth and you tone your airway.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   It's called myofunctional therapy.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.480]   I think a branding expert needs to come in and rename that something hot
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.240]   because that word sucks.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.160]   But these myofunctional exercises for kids, even with sleep problems
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.920]   or with speech problems, can be incredibly beneficial. OK.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.280]   And so that's a lot about the mouth.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.080]   We should be nasal breathers.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.320]   What do we need to be doing to make that more possible?
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   I know a lot of people are always congested, struggle
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.560]   breathing through their nose, even when they're not trying.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.400]   Does this get even harder now that people might try to do it more intentionally?
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.560]   I would love to give you just one clear answer, but of course I'm not.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.640]   So I'm going to have to give you three separate answers
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.480]   because I can't offer a blanket prescription for everybody.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   Everyone's different and almost everyone has a specific problem
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.680]   with their nose that needs to be addressed in a specific way.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.040]   For some people, they need surgery.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.000]   OK, they have such a severely deviated septum or the turbinates are too big
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.600]   or too small that they need surgery to open that up.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.240]   So for the vast majority of people, they need to learn
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.800]   how to breathe through their noses in and out a lot more often.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.400]   And when they do that, the nose can tend to open up.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.760]   So it depends on who you are, where you are on that spectrum.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.040]   There are a number of different hacks you can use.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:41.040]   There are nasal dilators, breathe right strips that lift the nostrils up,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   create about 30% more space in the nostrils.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.720]   There are things that go inside of your nose to open them up.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.280]   They're called mute inserts.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.080]   I'm not endorsing.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.400]   I don't get paid from any of these companies, but they tend to really help
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.000]   people who are snoring because they allow more airflow.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.120]   So sometimes the problem is with the nostrils.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   Sometimes it's further up in the sinuses.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.680]   You have to diagnose where the issue is first.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.120]   But one thing everyone can do without going in and getting a scan
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.040]   is learn how to hum more and learn how to practice nasal breathing,
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.800]   inhaling and exhaling and see what that does for you first
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.360]   before you take a further step.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.720]   OK, and I've heard you say that there's benefits
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.400]   to just breathing through your nose because the way our nose is built.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.000]   Of course, yeah.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.120]   If you were to take a deli slicer view of your head now,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.000]   the nose takes up this huge amount of real estate, right?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.720]   Has all these very ornate, intricate structures.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.560]   That stuff isn't there randomly.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.880]   When we take an air, all of those structures baffle it
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.560]   and they clean it and they cleanse it and they defend our bodies
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.960]   against bacteria, viruses, allergens and more.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.680]   And when you're breathing through the mouth,
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.440]   you don't get any of those things, right? It's unfiltered.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.240]   Everything that's in the air
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.480]   is just entering directly into your lungs, which is bad news.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.200]   And how does nitric oxide play into this?
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.680]   So nitric oxide, a lot of people think this is laughing gas and it's not.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.600]   Wouldn't that be wonderful if we were just naturally produced
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.880]   a constant supply of whippets all the time?
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.440]   So this is nitric and nitric oxide.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.840]   This is a miraculous molecule that helps kill
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.680]   bacteria, helps kill viruses, is a vasodilator.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.560]   So it opens up blood vessels.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.680]   The way that erectile dysfunction drugs work, how do they work?
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.360]   They work by allowing your body to release more nitric oxide.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.920]   So we get six times more nitric oxide
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.400]   breathing in and out of our noses.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.520]   When I mentioned that thing about humming, when you hum,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:58.600]   you get 15 fold increase of nitric oxide,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.520]   which is why people who have chronic rhinitis, sinusitis,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.680]   you feel a cold coming on, start humming immediately.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.000]   And I think it can make a big improvement.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.880]   There have not been clinical trials of there never will be.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.600]   But I can say anecdotally, it's made a huge improvement for me
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.200]   and with hundreds of people that I've spoken to.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.360]   And I think about all these exercises I'm practicing breathing.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.040]   One of the things that just came to mind is I feel like a lot of breathing
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.080]   is like, oh, where you breathe your air into increasing capacity of your lungs,
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.200]   breathing into your stomach.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.120]   Like how much do those does that end of breath matter in all of this?
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.080]   I like how we're moving on down.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.880]   We got the mouth. We got the nose.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.360]   We're moving down to the airway.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.280]   So, yeah, it is beautiful.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.160]   So this is another very important thing.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.440]   And it's also extremely boring.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.760]   And but I'm going to make it very brief for you.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.240]   So once you have that nose thing figured out, number one, that's it.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.080]   Because when you're breathing through the nose,
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.200]   you naturally will be breathing deeper.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.920]   You will be breathing more slowly, more oxygen, more easily
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.080]   defending your body, all that good stuff.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.360]   But now a lot of people are hunched over like this all day.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.400]   For those of you listening and not looking, I am just in a very typical posture
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   in which my shoulders are hunched forward.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.200]   So even if I want to take a deep breath right now, I really can't.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.240]   I'm forced to breathe into my chest, whereas if I sit up,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.800]   it's much easier to breathe deeper and we want to breathe deeper
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.560]   because the vast majority of the oxygen that we absorb
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.320]   is in the lower lobes of the lungs. Right.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.920]   So it's much more efficient.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   You are also sending your body
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.160]   relaxing messages when you are breathing deeper.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.720]   Right, so I can give you 20 different reasons
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.480]   why it's so important to breathe deep, but but trust me, it's good.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.440]   But the majority of people
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.240]   breathe paradoxically, OK?
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.440]   And what that means is when they're breathing deep,
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.640]   they suck in their stomach every time they inhale.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.400]   Why? Because they want to look hot, right?
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   You have to have hot looking abs.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.000]   You don't want a little punch going on there.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.520]   But this is so damaging to the body.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.520]   So once you have the nasal thing figured out, place a hand on your gut.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.400]   And when you breathe.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.240]   Yeah, that means you, too.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.760]   You should feel a light, a very light and slight expansion of your gut.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.840]   And this should be loose.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.280]   Save, save the rock hard abs for, you know, Fort Lauderdale spring break.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.440]   The rest of the time, your belly should be loose.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.160]   And when you inhale, you should feel that slight expansion.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:50.080]   And the vast majority of people do not allow themselves
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.760]   the privilege of having a looser belly and having that deeper breath.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.000]   And that's one of the reasons they're in this vicious cycle of anxiety
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.280]   and constant stress.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.240]   Is that they're holding their stress in their stomach and their stress
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   in their stomach and the signals they're getting from the vagus nerve down here
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.040]   and all the other nerves and the frantic nerve that's attached to the diaphragm
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.320]   is that you are in a stressful, dangerous situation
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.560]   because you're breathing like this,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.760]   which is what we do when we get very nervous.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.840]   So there's this feedback loop between your brain and your gut
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.080]   and the diaphragm, right?
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.360]   And if you're constantly sending your brain messages
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.680]   that you are threatened or injured, you're going to stay in that state
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.280]   of chronic stress.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.320]   And I guess the deep lungs, you said, are calming.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.360]   So you're both you're you're kind of pushing both directions
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.240]   in the opposite way.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.000]   Yeah. And look, look at any animal in the wild
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.040]   and look at how it's breathing when it's calm, even even when they're stressed out.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.160]   They're breathing deep, fluidly and slowly.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.760]   Why should we be breathing any differently? Right.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.400]   That's this is what we came from.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.240]   This is what we're supposed to be doing.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.240]   And we've completely lost touch with it.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.200]   I had a note that I missed over
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.120]   when we were talking about the nose that I just want to.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.760]   Nostrils, they're different left and right.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.160]   They're different.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.320]   So this is one of the craziest things that we mentioned with the nostrils.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.440]   About 30 percent of the population suffers from something
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.520]   called nasal valve collapse.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.080]   This means that the tissue around the nostrils here is too loose.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.320]   So when you inhale, it flutters. Right.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.120]   And that's one of the reasons you can't nasal breathe or the nostrils
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.680]   themselves are too small.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.640]   So you don't have enough space there to get air easily in and out.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.560]   Beyond all that, our left nostrils and right nostrils control different
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.000]   or I should say influence different functions in our bodies.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.160]   Our left nostril breathing in and out of our left left nostril.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.720]   The heart rate will lower.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.120]   Blood pressure will lower.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.720]   You will get calmer.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.320]   The Yogi's believe you will get cooler.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.160]   This is the the cooling softer nostrils to breathe through.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.120]   When you are inhaling through your right, you're stimulating the body.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   Heart rate goes up.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.040]   Blood pressure goes up.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.400]   You get hotter.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.720]   So you might say, cool, that yoga stuff is interesting, but can it be proven?
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.560]   Has it been tested?
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.600]   And the answer is yes.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.920]   There's about two dozen studies that have shown even in the brain
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.720]   how this affects the brain breathing in and out of one nostril to the other.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.280]   What's interesting is there are yogic practices
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.480]   in which you are doing alternate nostril breathing.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.520]   A lot of people know that.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.880]   But our nostrils do this automatically every 30 minutes to three to four hours.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.080]   They will shift primarily from the left to the right or the right to the left.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.960]   So why why would they do this?
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.160]   Why would our bodies design ourselves to do this?
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.360]   I think they do this as a way to help balance the body.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.520]   You need more energy.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.040]   OK, it's going to shift close off the left shift to the right.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.360]   You need to calm down, calm yourself.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.560]   OK, we're going to shift to the left, which is fascinating to me.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.160]   Does that mean that if you're kind of in a state of stress,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.720]   you should close up a nostril and breathe through one?
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.680]   You certainly can do that, which is why that alternate
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.040]   nostril breathing works so well, right?
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.280]   There's studies behind that as well.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.320]   So breathing in and out through your left nostril and breathing,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.560]   making making sure you are exhaling through your right.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.480]   All that stuff can really calm you down.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.560]   If you don't believe me, you can check this out with whatever watch
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.280]   or ring you happen to be wearing, and you can see this happening in real time.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.080]   So you mentioned this breathe in through one nostril out to the other.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.240]   And I realize we haven't really talked about the exhale.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.680]   So you said, you know, learning to breathe through your nose
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.040]   instead of your mouth.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.920]   Where do we want to be breathing out?
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.520]   You definitely want to be exhaling through your nose. OK.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.880]   So I keep getting this question so much so that I went back to
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.240]   and I convinced the publisher to put this huge note
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.600]   in the book that says this should be breathing in and out.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.080]   And I mentioned a few times in the book, still get hundreds and hundreds
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.640]   of letters of people thinking I didn't identify that it was the nose
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   who are now walk these poor people walking around.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.240]   Has any other animal done that breathe like that?
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.440]   No, you don't want to do that.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.760]   You want to exhale through the nose because that forces you to take a slower
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.240]   exhale, more time to absorb more oxygen.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.680]   Longer, slower, calmer breaths.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.520]   So inhaling and exhaling through the nose, just like any other mammal.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.480]   How do they breathe?
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   They inhale and exhale through the nose.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.760]   And is this true in all circumstances?
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.640]   If you're, you know, sprinting and running a race?
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.960]   Do you do you change your breathing style or is it kind of consistent
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.120]   across all activities?
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.520]   I am talking about breathing during rest.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.280]   OK, for the vast majority of exercise, for like 85% of exercise
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:53.760]   in and out through the nose is much more optimal to be breathing this way.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:59.040]   If you're really cranking it up to zone four, if you're entering into zone five,
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.880]   you can take your consider breathing like a gear on a car
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.200]   when we had cars with gears.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.680]   And this is putting it in a fifth and you can consciously
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.640]   default to mouth breathing as a conscious action
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   for that moment to address that moment.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.520]   So there is a time and a place for everything.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.640]   I'm talking about nasal breathing at rest.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:27.000]   If you are an elite athlete and need to use that mouth breathing, that's great.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.320]   If you are jogging at a medium pace, you have no excuse
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.760]   to be breathing through your mouth.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.160]   And I can tell you of the thousands of people I've seen jogging by,
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.760]   maybe about three or four of them have been nasal breathing
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.600]   and they're not doing themselves any favors mouth breathing.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.160]   And can you just tell this by watching their mouth open?
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.720]   Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.760]   You can see it. OK.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.240]   And once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.960]   So unfortunately for you, you are going to be out looking at people
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.800]   jogging and looking at their mouths in airports at restaurants.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.040]   It's an awful thing.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.760]   I'm trying to erase it from my brain, but here we are talking about it once again.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.840]   Yeah. Sorry, your next airport trip.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.240]   Are there exercises when it comes to just breathing
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.200]   that we can use to practice our breath?
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.520]   Right. You talked about the kinds of breaths we want to take.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.560]   I know there are plenty and we shouldn't go through all of them.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.320]   But are there a few kind of entry level breathing techniques or exercises
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.240]   someone just resting can do to practice their breathing?
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.880]   Next time you're walking, inhale for four steps and exhale for four steps.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.920]   And if that's really comfortable for you, inhale for four steps and exhale for six.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.920]   OK. Try that out.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.200]   See how that feels.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.440]   If it feels like you're pushing it too much, you're really out of breath.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.280]   You can shorten that, you know, three and three, three and five, whatever.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.800]   But breathing at this pace rhythm while you're walking
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.600]   allows your body to enter the state of coherence where your heart rate
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   is locked in with your respiratory rate and everything is working like a watch.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.320]   And this is what you want, especially if you're a competitive athlete.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   It helps you burn more fat because fat burns with oxygen.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.200]   And we get more oxygen this way.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.280]   Helps calm you down while you're walking.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.920]   If you are just sitting around, nasal breathing is 70 percent,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.760]   75 percent of good breathing because it allows you to breathe
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.280]   more slowly and breathe more rhythmically.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.560]   It's hard to hyperventilate.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.920]   Doesn't work that way, right?
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.800]   You breathe calmly and quietly when you're nasal breathing.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.320]   If you want to add a little something to that, you can start
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.600]   breathing into a rhythm.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.760]   What's beneficial for a lot of people is around five to six seconds in
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.200]   and five to six seconds out.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.440]   A lot of apps that can train you.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   Is there a pause at the end?
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.640]   So breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.400]   Or think of it like a circle. OK.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   OK. This is what the yogis do.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.560]   Your inhalation and exhalation.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.800]   And this doesn't mean you should stress out about it.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.680]   And I get I get a lot of comments from people down here in Silicon Valley
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.360]   who are stressed out about the quarter second pause between the inhale.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.560]   Just calm the F down and just breathe fluidly.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.320]   Imagine as though you're breathing into that circle. OK.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:22.040]   That's really helpful if you find yourself at a state of stress
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.160]   and you really need to dial things down.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.000]   Try breathing in for four, holding for eight
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.160]   and out for eight, four, eight, eight.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.120]   Breathing can be very effective at downregulating stress.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:41.520]   OK. So in that case, there's a gap in the circle to pause in between and hold.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.840]   There is a breath hold and breath holding is a little more advanced,
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.760]   but is so beneficial for people with anxiety,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.960]   asthma, athletes and more. OK.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.760]   And what about some of these?
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.000]   I mean, the method I know a lot of people in the Bay Area
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.680]   have talked about is like Wim Hof and these kind of more extreme
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.440]   breathing techniques.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   I often wonder if sometimes they're so advanced.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.040]   People should really just have even learned to breathe through your nose
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.080]   before you start to learn these things.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.240]   Do those have a place for the average person
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.720]   or are they kind of really edge case things that people shouldn't start with?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.800]   I absolutely love those vigorous practices.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.720]   OK, I just got back a day and a half ago from a retreat that we do
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.480]   where there's a lot of very long hour long vigorous practice. Right.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.640]   But we don't do that until the end of the retreat.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.400]   The reason is I'd say 95% of the people who show up are breathing dysfunctionally.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.160]   This even means like the ripped bro with tattoos,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   like full and full ketosis for three months breathing so dysfunctionally.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.720]   So you have to have the solid foundation of healthy breathing
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.680]   and healthy biomechanics before you can really get the benefits
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.640]   from that other breathwork.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.800]   I'm not saying you can't just roll out of bed and do that
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.840]   without any programming and you won't feel something from it.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.680]   You will.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.920]   But if you really want to feel the full range of benefits,
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.840]   you have to get the rest of of what a proper breath is in gear.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.080]   And then you can do those more advanced breathwork systems.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.720]   And they really pack a punch.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:26.000]   And earlier, you're talking about how important oxygen is for our body.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.720]   Can you breathe too much or too fast?
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.600]   And, you know, in my mind, I'm like, oh, more oxygen equals better.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.680]   Breathe faster, breathe more.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.960]   I feel like that is counterintuitive.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.240]   So right now, I want you to mouth breathe.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.640]   This will be real quick. Don't worry.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.560]   There won't be dead air.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.800]   Just start mouth breathing and start breathing too much.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.560]   Start breathing too much. Yeah.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.040]   More, more. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.760]   There. How do you feel?
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.480]   There's a little lightness in your head.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.200]   There's some tingling in your fingers and your feet. Right.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.880]   Do you think that's from more oxygen in your body?
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.360]   It's from a decrease of carbon dioxide
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.160]   and all your blood vessels start closing.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.360]   So that is from a lack of blood flow to those areas.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.920]   So when you were over breathing like this,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   you were actually inhibiting your body's ability to use oxygen.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.320]   And this is something most people get wrong.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.560]   And this is something I got wrong for years and years.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.120]   Because you think, well, if I eat more food, I get more calories, right?
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.760]   If I breathe more air, I get more oxygen.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.240]   The opposite is happening.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.200]   You get more oxygen by breathing very slowly in and out of your nose
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.760]   because you need that balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen to do its thing.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.000]   Which is why when you go to Wim Hof breathing or your vigorous Pranayama
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.560]   or Kundalini, people think, oh, you know, those moments,
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.160]   those five minutes where I'm just breathing, I feel so high
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.520]   because I have so much oxygen in my body.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.200]   You feel so high because you are blocking blood flow to your brain.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.280]   That's what it's doing.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.200]   And there's a reason there's a breath hold right after that,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.480]   because then CO2 levels go up, all that oxygen in your bloodstream
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.080]   that hasn't made it to your hungry cells releases.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.960]   And so your body gets saturated from oxygen,
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.760]   from a state of hypoxia to full oxygenation throughout your body.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.960]   And which is why the Wim Hof method, very ancient method,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.960]   is identical to dozens and dozens of other methods
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.760]   that have you hyperventilate and hold your breath, hyperventilate
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.880]   and hold your breath.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.960]   And it's so beneficial.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.120]   We know that the science is very clear on that now.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.520]   What about our diaphragm?
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.600]   We've talked about a lot of the parts that are involved
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.160]   in the breathing techniques and just the whole process, but I feel like.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.000]   It's a special, special organ.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.240]   It's a special organ.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.000]   The most important muscle in your body is the diaphragm,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.600]   because if something happens with that, you're just dead within a couple of minutes.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.160]   So the diaphragm is what sits underneath your lungs.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.760]   So the lungs don't inflate themselves.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.640]   They're like wet balloons, right?
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.160]   They need something to do that.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.360]   So as the diaphragm descends when you inhale.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:12.640]   The diaphragm descends here, creates a vacuum and the lungs fill up with air.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.000]   And as the diaphragm relaxes.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.200]   You exhale, right?
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.000]   So inhaling, the diaphragm stretches out here,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.560]   sinks down into our guts and exhaling, it comes back up.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.400]   You need that range of motion in the diaphragm.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.880]   And most of us only use about 10% of the motion of the diaphragm.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:39.640]   If that a lot of people are using maybe 5% really dysfunctional breathers,
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.560]   which is why they start.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.800]   You see people start to breathe like this when they get older.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.200]   It's really sad that they're using their shoulders, right?
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.600]   Every breath you see a little tension here because their diaphragms
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.960]   aren't moving at all.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.240]   So you have to have this fluidity and this incursion
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.640]   and excursion of the diaphragm in order to breathe healthy.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.160]   So not only is that motion of the diaphragm important for breathing,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.680]   but that diaphragm pushes down on all your organs down here.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.840]   OK, the intestines, stomach, liver, all of that.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.080]   And helps them purge toxins, helps them purge lymph fluid.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.880]   So you need that range of motion in order for you to rid yourself
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.800]   of stuff and keep things moving in your organs.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.080]   And so how do you start using the other 90% that's just you breathe?
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.880]   You breathe deep breaths, OK?
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.960]   OK, do all the things that I just mentioned.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.000]   You place your hand on your belly.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.760]   You become comfortable enough with yourself that you can relax your stomach.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.360]   And all the go getters that are listening to this podcast right now
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.120]   who are running companies, who are stressed out, who look great.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.160]   You have to have flexibility in your belly, OK?
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.600]   You have to be comfortable with that when you inhale.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.120]   You have to be comfortable
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.680]   that there's going to be a slight extension of your belly.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.040]   You will be so much happier and so much healthier if you do this.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.160]   You'll look great, too. So don't worry about that.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.360]   So that's how you get that range of motion.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.800]   You become comfortable with a deep breath
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.480]   and you have to make sure that you exhale properly, too.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.320]   So and coming back to your question, right?
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.360]   You said, what's up with the exhale?
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.840]   So most of us just tend to breathe like this.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.320]   Just packing air, packing air, packing air.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.560]   So the diaphragm is just stretched out in this position.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.160]   We're not exhaling.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.880]   Allowing the diaphragm to come back up.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.480]   So exhaling and practicing long exhales is very beneficial
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.200]   because do you want to drive across the country and fill up your tank
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.280]   every time it gets down to a half a tank or, you know, three quarters of a tank?
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   No, you want to fill it up once it's empty, right?
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.520]   Because you're going to save a lot more time and effort doing that.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.960]   It's the same thing with our lungs.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.640]   Why do we want to just keep packing air in there when we should empty them first?
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.520]   Before we fill them back up again.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.720]   So another reason you should take those low, deep, slow breaths.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.200]   OK. And these are things that I imagine once you practice enough,
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.080]   they just become natural, right?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.120]   You're not thinking while we're talking today, oh, I've got to take a deep breath.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.680]   Oh, I don't want to suck in my stomach.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   Oh, it just becomes habit.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.480]   And all of the benefits we talked about earlier start to unfold in life.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.680]   Nobody wants to have to think about this stuff.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.320]   No one wants another checkbox, right?
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.120]   To have to go through every day.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.960]   I mean, think about the number of supplements
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.000]   we're supposed to be eating right now, you know, along with sleeping,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.720]   along with everything else.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.680]   But it can take months to develop good habits, right?
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.720]   Look, I don't have to doing this stuff and learning this stuff
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.600]   and being shamed by so many breathwork teachers for so long.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.440]   I don't have to think I know I'm nasal breathing throughout the day.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.080]   I know I'm nasal breathing at night because I'm using tape.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.920]   I know I'm breathing deeply and I'm breathing slowly.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.600]   But that took a long time to get there.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.080]   So the point is to build these good habits, to work at the beginning.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.480]   But you don't have to think about it.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.200]   And what I'm asking, I won't say what I'm asking,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:21.880]   what these other researchers have asked people to do is not outrageous.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.760]   It sounds a little weird.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.040]   It's like, oh, I got to put my mouth this weird posture.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.040]   I got to sit up. I got to loosen my belly.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.800]   This is how we're designed to breathe.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.920]   This is the natural way we're relearning what we were supposed to have been doing.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.280]   Right. So it's not like some new fangled development
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.800]   that we'll learn 10 years later is bad for us.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.560]   This is the right way of doing it, because this is the way
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.720]   nature has designed us to breathe.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.360]   And how you said months.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.680]   But how quickly would someone start to see some impact of doing this?
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.200]   Do you think 30 seconds?
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.280]   If you think I'm joking, I know you do.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.760]   You find me someone suffering from severe anxiety
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.040]   or panic or even asthma who is breathing extremely dysfunctionally
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.400]   because they all are people with those problems.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.240]   And you teach them how to take a slow breath,
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.040]   something most of them never been taught how to do.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.200]   And you teach them how to relax their shoulders a bit, relax their stomach a bit.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   And you see this calm come over them within a minute.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   That is can be transformative for a lot of people.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.720]   And some of them, after a few minutes, just start crying
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.120]   because I've never felt this before is no doctor has ever told them
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.840]   anything about this.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.320]   So I think that these fundamentals, these very simple things anybody can do.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.400]   If it's not right for you, if you want to go back to bronchodilators,
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.080]   you know, SSRIs, that's totally fine.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.120]   There's no judgment on that.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.440]   However, you should give your body a chance to balance first
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   before you make up your mind.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   And why haven't doctors prescribed to breathing as as an alternative?
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.600]   There's doctors in my family, there's a pulmonologist in my family.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.880]   Half of my friends are doctors.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.080]   They don't have time.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.080]   They're as frustrated as anybody else about this.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.280]   When you're seeing 20 patients in an hour, if you're in an ER, right,
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.000]   you're dealing with people just got in a frickin car accident.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.760]   You don't have time to sit someone down.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.320]   Do you suffer from mild anxiety?
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.320]   I'm going to sit you down here, you know, and teach you how to breathe right.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.080]   And it turns out that most of these doctors are terrible breathers as well.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.840]   So I think that's one thing.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.160]   There's a lot more awareness around this.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.920]   They're just dealing with emergencies all day long, right?
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.400]   They don't have time to do it.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.840]   But I'm seeing that starting to change.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.800]   A lot of doctors have reached out to me.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.040]   They want to learn more about it.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.360]   They want to start instilling more education in their staff
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.600]   and their patients and developing a system to do that.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:52.080]   So in the States, I just don't think, you know, it's pretty cut throat out there
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.800]   and you got to turn over patients, and that's why. Wow.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.040]   One one other thing we didn't talk about was posture.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.600]   And it's funny when I'm sitting here, I'm constantly very, very self-conscious
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.480]   as well here.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.800]   So two self-conscious guys trying to have the best posture.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.720]   How important is it to sit correctly,
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   to be able to breathe correctly?
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.760]   It's so important.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.680]   We got into this a little bit earlier.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.720]   So when we're hunched over, especially if we have a laptop
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   and we're at a cafe or hunched over like this,
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.120]   even if you wanted that diaphragm to descend, if that was your intention,
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.280]   you can't do it because you've cut it off, right?
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.120]   You've forked it off.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.600]   You can only breathe into the chest and you can get by doing this,
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.480]   but it's not healthy.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.960]   You're you know, in the Dow 1200 years ago, there's this quote that
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.520]   that talked about how form dictates breathing and breathing dictates posture.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.800]   So, of course, those two things are connected.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.200]   You want to be able to breathe that low, slow breath.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.640]   And so you have to have the posture that's conducive to doing that.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.480]   OK, and what about work standing desks?
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.680]   You know, I've heard great things happen over here.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.200]   I don't use it as much as I.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.360]   Well, maybe maybe I will find out as much as I should or shouldn't.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.360]   Is standing more instead of sitting more solve a lot of these problems?
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.800]   It solves a lot of the posture breathing problems.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   I'm a huge fan of standing desk, and even if I don't want to do it,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.600]   I make myself do it and I go back and forth throughout the day
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.200]   when I just get tired, too tired of standing out, I'll sit.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.640]   And that's that's the wonders of having these desks that are very adjustable.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.240]   So it solves a lot of these problems, not not all of them, but a lot of them.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.360]   It allows the diaphragm to descend properly.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   It allows you to take a proper exhale.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.600]   It makes you more conscious of your breathing.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.480]   So I think there's so many good reasons to use a standing desk
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.800]   and breathing function and biomechanics is just one of them.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.520]   OK. Any other things, devices, products
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.760]   people could have on hand to just aid in this entire journey?
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.080]   We talked about standing desk.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.760]   We talked about mouth tape.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.280]   I think those were the some of the nasal strips and stuff.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.200]   Anything else?
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.880]   So I take no money from any any of these companies.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.400]   OK, just to be totally clear, maybe I should or I should have a few years ago.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.360]   So the nasal strips can be really beneficial for people
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.040]   who suffer from snoring, OK?
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.760]   And you can try those out when you're jogging as well.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.520]   I can't breathe in and out of my nose.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.880]   Try one out, right?
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.280]   They have them that are flesh colored, right?
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.800]   If you're self-conscious about it, but no one's looking at you anyway.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   So wear one of those.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.080]   That can really help.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.080]   Sprays are good for chronic congestion.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.880]   Neti pots, I get a lot of benefit from those.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.800]   I also carry around these sprays.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.560]   I fly around a lot.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.600]   And, you know, that's how you can be exposed
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.440]   to a lot of different viruses and bacteria.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.040]   So I'm a fan of those.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.520]   Beyond that, you know, what other tools can you use?
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.320]   There are dozens and dozens of different things.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.960]   Those are the primary ones to the good training wheels
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.520]   to help you build that solid foundation.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520]   I would start with that.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.080]   And when you say sprays, do you mean just like nasal mist of saline
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.120]   or do you mean kind of ones with drugs in them?
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.760]   You know, afrin, those kinds of things.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.920]   Xylitol is a good one.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:16.680]   So saline and xylitol has been shown to be pretty good.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.560]   And that those are the ones I use.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.120]   And also for more heavy duty stuff, if you know you've been exposed
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:27.280]   to something in in the air or if you're around a bunch of people of COVID,
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.960]   you know, some have a small dose of iodine in it that that can be really beneficial.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.280]   So you just have to assess, do you constantly have congestion?
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.200]   And if the answer is yes, there's a number of things you can do.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.360]   And those those sprays are one of them.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.240]   Also, humming.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.040]   I know I mentioned it once.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.360]   It can be really, really beneficial.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.760]   You're not going to hear about this because there are zero amount of dollars
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.880]   that are to be made by telling people to hum.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.040]   However, there's two different companies right now that have devices.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.640]   And guess what these devices do?
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.960]   Their FDA cleared devices, they've been shown to work.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.160]   Guess what they do?
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.400]   They make your nose hum.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.040]   They hum for you.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.280]   They hum for you.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.960]   OK, you put them on your face and they hum for you
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.920]   at a resonant frequency of around 120 hertz,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.160]   which is for most heads is the most productive for nitric oxide.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.040]   But you can just hum a B2 on a piano.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.560]   And it does the same thing.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.760]   Or you can strap this thing on your face, which is totally fine, too.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.160]   Again, no judgment, of course, no judgment.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.360]   One aspect of breath we haven't talked about,
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.040]   and I know you wrote a book on freediving
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.440]   and we haven't talked about holding your breath.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.000]   And, you know, is there any benefit other than for sports
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.880]   like freediving to actually learn to hold your breath longer?
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.080]   And is that something we should also be training?
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:52:00.240]   There is a reason why all of the ancient Qigong methods
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.120]   that date back thousands of years, breath holding is center.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.920]   Along with breathing slowly, nasal breathing, all the things we talked about.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.400]   There is a reason why if you look at ancient yoga practices,
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.080]   pranayama practices, pranayama means the cessation of breath.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.440]   OK, holding your breath.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.880]   We can build more EPO.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.440]   We can, which helps us build more red blood cells.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.960]   We can build blood vessels.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.440]   We can release more P53 and HIF-1.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.200]   If you're getting really technical things that have been shown
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.280]   that can help defend us against cancer and other issues.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.160]   Five maximum breath holds over a course of five minutes
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.800]   shoots up your EPO by something like 23 percent.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.440]   It's some an EPO is erythropoietin, OK?
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.280]   Not protein.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   People often get that wrong, and I certainly do as well.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.200]   But that is what triggers the release and the growth of red blood cells.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.680]   So you can carry more oxygen more easily.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.040]   One of the reasons why athletes go to altitude,
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.360]   they do altitude training is to build blood.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.360]   You can do that by breath holding.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.280]   So there are so many reasons to hold your breath and all of them are good.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.040]   And I mean, there's there's kind of two versions.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.600]   One is just hold your breath to the extent you can.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.320]   And one is, you know, we've all been snorkeling or many people have.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.680]   It's like, well, wow, if I could hold my breath for three minutes,
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.440]   I could, you know, do more.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.840]   How important is the longevity of the breath hold versus just doing it?
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.880]   I'm going to do a little self edit here.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.920]   So conscious breath holding.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   So many benefits.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.160]   Conscious breath hold.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.640]   Unconscious breath holding something called EMO,
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:48.080]   apnea or continuous partial attention syndrome is very bad for you.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.600]   This is a fear response, OK?
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.280]   When you are nervous about something, someone says something that upsets you,
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.160]   you look at your email, your boss is yelling at you, you hold your breath.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.440]   That's a fear response.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.760]   People do that throughout the day.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.960]   That's very bad.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.000]   Unconscious breath holding.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.360]   Sleep apnea. Unconscious breath holding. Very bad.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.120]   So I hope I made that extreme, extremely clear.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.800]   When you're willing yourself, when you are making the decision
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.320]   to take a big breath of air and hold your breath,
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.360]   there are so many benefits to be done by that because you're doing it
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.320]   in a very controlled way and you're only doing it a few times.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.040]   You're not doing it throughout the day.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.680]   So what else does breath holding do for you?
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.280]   It allows you to hold your breath.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.360]   If you get really good at it, hold your breath for five, six,
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.280]   seven minutes at a time.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.080]   And if you're able to do that, you have this secret key
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.840]   that only few people have that allows you to unlock
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.040]   the wonders of the underwater world.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.520]   A lot of people who are scuba divers think that they also have this key
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.080]   and they do to a certain extent have been a scuba diver for for decades.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   But when you are a breath hold diver, when you are a free diver,
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:00.640]   you are able to enter into the underwater world in complete silence.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.240]   And so all of the other life forms come up to you and interact with you
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.320]   because they think you belong down there.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.760]   You're not loud huffing and puffing like you have a leaf blower out, right?
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.360]   And disturbing everything.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.160]   And this is how you get access to dolphins come up.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.920]   They start communicating with you.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.640]   It's like some new age dream whales come up to you.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.080]   It's just such a beautiful thing.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.560]   It's something I discovered how to do about 12, 13 years ago.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.920]   I learned how to free dive from some of the best people in the world.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.200]   And it's something I think about all the time and can't wait to do more often.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:37.480]   And how I mean, I think some people might think learning to hold your breath
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.680]   for five, six minutes is something that, you know, is genetic and gifted.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.480]   Is there a training protocol that anyone could learn to do that?
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.760]   Anyone in a reasonable health, give me 45 minutes
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:52.080]   and I will get them holding their breath for around three minutes,
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.480]   three and a half minutes.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.680]   And I've seen this time and time again.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.120]   And then after a week or two, you're holding your breath for four minutes
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.160]   to five minutes.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.000]   And if I mean, if it takes 45 minutes to explain,
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.320]   tell people where they can go, because I'm sure you said,
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.680]   give me 45 minutes and I can do it.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.720]   And I'm sure your phone call, your phone's not open for everyone.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.000]   No, no, no. Don't call me.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.800]   I'm not a certified freedive teacher.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.760]   You want to talk to.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.880]   So when I was talking about Qigong, I was talking about pranayama.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.320]   I was talking about breathwork, Wim Hof method.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.640]   In a lot of people do Wim Hof method, which which is fantastic.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.040]   The breath hold by around third or fourth round is three minutes, four minutes.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.560]   People are nailing that within the second or third time they've
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.800]   they've done the Wim Hof method. Right.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.240]   So this is a matter of relearning things
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.520]   that your body automatically knows how to do.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.920]   So if you want to learn how to do this, you can do Wim Hof method.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.760]   You can take freediving training.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.680]   Freediving training is so beneficial for not only that access
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.960]   to the underwater world, but it teaches you about your lungs.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:00.080]   It allows you to have better lung capacity.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.280]   It allows you to stretch out your diaphragm, allows you to be entering into.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.440]   It allows you to enter into a meditative state wherever you are,
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.720]   whenever you want, because it focuses on the breath. Right.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.360]   You can't freedive.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.920]   And you can't hold your breath unless you know how to breathe properly.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:21.600]   You have to really access that that lung volume in order to hold your breath
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.600]   for five, six, seven, eight minutes.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.000]   Well, freediving has always been something I've kind of looked at with excitement
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.200]   and not explored.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.920]   And in researching this conversation is kind of a little bit of a spark
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.040]   that is something that I'm going to be spending some time on.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.680]   You know, throw out one little caveat.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:40.240]   So freediving has gotten popular again because of the deepest breath.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.560]   The Netflix special.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.400]   The only thing you're going to see about freediving
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.160]   is this glamorized competitive freediving,
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.240]   which is not true freediving.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.680]   I think that should be called something else
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.240]   because that is forcing your body to do things that
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.520]   to the limit in which you are.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.080]   Potentially going to kill yourself or hurt yourself, right?
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.920]   The freediving I'm talking about is listening to your body.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.320]   It's not turning off the messages your body is sending is listening to it.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.640]   Whenever you need to breathe, when you're freediving recreationally,
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.360]   you just go up to the surface and breathe.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.400]   You don't say, oh, I can I can go down another hundred feet,
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.120]   even though I really need to breathe.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.680]   You're attuned to your body.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.240]   And when you're attuned to your body, I think, yes,
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.800]   I think that this is a safe activity to do if you listen to your body, right?
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.520]   Your body's really smart.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.560]   You have to be conscious of that.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.720]   And also what it allows you to do is is be in a place
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.040]   where there's no cell phones, where there's there's no distractions at all.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.960]   You are alone.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.920]   You are in complete quiet.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.000]   You are surrounded by nature, and it's just such a magical thing.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.360]   And I would say from my experience, I'm probably not at five minutes,
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.440]   but maybe a minute or two.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.320]   It turns the average kind of, I don't know, Hawaii snorkel adventure
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.520]   into something ten times more interesting because everyone's
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.960]   kind of at the top looking down and you're down looking around and exploring.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.520]   Like you might scuba diving, but in a much more casual,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.320]   less expensive, easy to do setting, you'd be amazing where you can go in one minute.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.000]   OK, you'd be amazing.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.320]   The adventure that you can have in one minute of being weightless,
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.480]   of cruising around, of having fish come up to you, going down
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.960]   even 30 feet and sitting on the seafloor and just sitting there for a minute
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.280]   and having everything come around you and swirl around you
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.360]   and have them not be threatened by you, but being accepted
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.600]   as someone who belongs in the ocean.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.520]   I'm very excited.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.280]   Last thing I mentioned kids a few times.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:49.520]   Anything specific I should be doing at a young age or at any age for someone,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.480]   kids to help them with this, just practicing the same breathing techniques
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.160]   or any of them not safe for kids to do?
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.160]   Yeah, don't do Wim Hof with your three year olds, right?
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.680]   Something that a lot of people aren't talking about,
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.160]   which I'm going to spend these last moments to talk to you about
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.200]   is there is an epidemic of sleep dysfunction,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.600]   breathing, very dysfunctional breathing for kids,
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.360]   and that is directly related to ADHD.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.200]   So if you go into your kid's room at night and you hear them breathing,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.160]   if you see them breathing with an open mouth, if they are holding their breath,
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.760]   if they are snoring, these are serious warning signs.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.040]   And if you don't do anything about it, we know that this directly leads
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.000]   to developmental problems in the brain and in the body.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.920]   It can inhibit growth, bone growth and more.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.840]   So it's such a serious problem.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.200]   A lot of people aren't even talking about it because they don't know about it.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.720]   So assess your kid's breathing health as early as you possibly can.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.080]   And if they have a problem, if they're breathing dysfunctionally,
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.280]   you can absolutely fix it, right?
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.080]   They're kids. They're malleable.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.480]   They're bendable with the right input.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.160]   They can improve.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.800]   So that's that's something I would really focus on.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.920]   If your kid does not have any of those issues, if they're breathing normally,
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.760]   if they're a nasal breather, you can try breathing exercises with them.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.960]   You can try humming exercises with them.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.720]   They frickin love it because their bodies respond instantly to this.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.840]   Especially when they're crying, when they're stressed out.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.400]   When I was a kid, it used to be, hold your breath and count to ten.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.240]   Then respond to me.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.880]   That's a breath hold.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.720]   It works really well.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.080]   I I'm going to sneak into my kid's room tonight
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.200]   and listen to their breathing, and I'm really interested in this.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.080]   And you can put one final thing I'll mention about that.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.680]   You can there's various apps.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.880]   Again, I'm not getting paid by any of these apps.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.880]   There's SnoreLab, there's SnoreClock.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.920]   You can place your phone in your kid's room
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.960]   and it records their breathing throughout the night
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.760]   and then gives you a graph readout.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.080]   You don't have to go and listen to it.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.560]   Gives you a readout of where they are on the scale of breathing.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.320]   And that is one quick way.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.960]   It's not perfect, but it's a general assessment
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.760]   of how they're breathing throughout the night.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.880]   I would highly suggest parents do that.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.760]   It's free.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.280]   Can you do it for yourself also?
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.680]   Yes, you can do it for yourself.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.320]   It's not just for kids.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.240]   You can do it for yourself.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.000]   And this is one thing when people say, especially people who are single,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.440]   right, they don't have a spouse or a partner saying,
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.320]   you've been snoring throughout the night.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.720]   No, bro, I breathe great.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.880]   You know, I'm focused on everything else.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.960]   Use this app and let the app decide how good you're breathing
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.720]   because you can go back in both of these apps.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.280]   I think there's three or four of them.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.720]   And you can listen to yourself breathing throughout the night.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.640]   So if you're hearing
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.920]   or it's really bad news
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.280]   and you have to get that fixed.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.480]   So try those apps.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.760]   Snore Clock is one totally free.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.040]   Snore Lab is another.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.000]   They have a paid version.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.440]   They have a free version.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.000]   Again, I'm not getting paid by any of these apps, but I've used them both
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.240]   and I've really been impressed with it. Wow.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.600]   OK, we didn't touch on everything.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.680]   The book you have is incredible.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.480]   Where can people go who want to get more?
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.120]   I have a website, which I need to update sometime at Mr.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.720]   Mr. James Nester dot com, because some other
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.080]   James Nester in Michigan took took the real one.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.640]   So that's what I'm stuck with.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.720]   I also try to do the Instagram thing.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.760]   I'm not so hot at that either, but I'm posting to both of these.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.240]   All the latest research I'm finding easy tips.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.800]   It's all free. There's no paywall.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.760]   Come on over and I'll tell you what I'm learning along the way.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.200]   Yeah, I'll link to both those.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   I'll link to the book.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.560]   James, thanks for being here.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.500]   Thanks a lot for having me.
