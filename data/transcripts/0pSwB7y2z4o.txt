[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.680]   - Happy Friday to everyone.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.400]   Today's question comes from Casey in Oregon.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   Dear Pastor John, I have been a Christian
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.600]   and a Bible student and a Bible teacher for many years,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   but I sometimes find myself a little puzzled
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.260]   and if I'm honest, a bit disquieted
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.000]   by John's teaching on abiding.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.960]   In particular, I think of the opening of John 15
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.640]   and much of the material of the letter of 1 John.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.320]   It provokes many questions for me.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   For example, how does this relate
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840]   to the doctrine of perseverance?
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.880]   And does this mean that in some sense,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.000]   it is up to me to keep me in God's family?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.060]   Could you give a brief APJ length overview
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.340]   of John's theology of abiding in Christ?
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.400]   - What is an APJ length?
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.320]   If you ask Tony, it's one thing.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.480]   - Yes it is, that's right.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   - He's always on my case to make it shorter.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.800]   So here we go, let's do it quick.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.640]   - It's true.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.680]   - This is huge, I mean, a challenge to give a theology
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.240]   of abiding in 10 minutes.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.480]   Let's see what we can do.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.040]   I'm gonna sum it up from John 15.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.400]   Let's just go there with seven or is it six points?
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.560]   I can't remember how many I jotted down here.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.040]   It's just six.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.840]   Yeah, six points.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   Let's read it.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.200]   I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.720]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.880]   and every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.160]   that it may bear more fruit.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.080]   Already you are clean because of the word
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.360]   that I have spoken to you.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.640]   by itself unless it abides in the vine,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.120]   neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.580]   So first observation, number one.
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.520]   I think the essential meaning of our act of abiding,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   our act of abiding is the act of receiving and trusting
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.940]   all that God is for us in Christ.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.940]   If a branch remains or abides attached to the vine
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.760]   in such a way that it is receiving all that the branch
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   has to give, then that is a picture of what John means
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.120]   by believing or trusting Jesus.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.960]   He says in chapter one, verse 12, to all who receive him,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.600]   who believed in his name, he gave the right to become
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.420]   the children of God.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.420]   So believing is a receiving of Christ into the soul,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.560]   welcoming him, trusting him, as it were, drinking
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.480]   and eating and savoring him, which is what he says
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.920]   in chapter six, verse 40, 35.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.840]   I am the bread of life.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.600]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.400]   Whoever believes in me shall never thirst.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.880]   So believing is an attachment to, a coming to,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   an attachment to Jesus and a receiving from Jesus,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   a trusting in Jesus, a remaining in fellowship with Jesus,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.040]   connected to Jesus so that all that God is for us in him
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.600]   is flowing like a life-giving sap into our lives.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.480]   So that's number one, abiding is believing,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.020]   trusting, savoring, resting, receiving.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.020]   Number two, Jesus gets very specific about what is flowing
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.520]   between the vine and the branch.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.260]   He mentions words, his words, his love, his joy.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.260]   Verse seven, if you abide in me and my words abide in you,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.840]   ask whatever you wish.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.880]   Verse nine, as the father has loved me, so I have loved you.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.480]   Abide in my love.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.920]   Verse 11, these things I have spoken to you
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.520]   So abiding in the vine means receiving and believing
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   and trusting in the words of Jesus and the love of Jesus
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.560]   for the father and for his people and the joy
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.520]   that Jesus has in the father and in us.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   It means sharing the joy, the love, the words with Jesus.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.880]   This is very similar to Paul saying
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.200]   the fruit of the spirit is love and joy
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   as we hear and trust the promises of Christ
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.200]   in Galatians 5 and Galatians 3.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.320]   Number three, third observation,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   nothing of any spiritual eternal significance is possible
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.280]   apart from this abiding in the vine.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.600]   Whoever abides in me and I in him,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.960]   he it is that bears much fruit
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   for apart from me, you can do nothing, zero, John 15, five.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.220]   In other words, we are not dealing here
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.080]   with something marginal or optional.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.900]   If we are not united to the vine
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.200]   so that Christ's life is flowing into us,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.000]   his words, his love, his joy,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   we will be utterly, utterly, totally barren.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.960]   Nothing of any lasting value will come from us.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   Observation number four, abiding proves
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.000]   whether the attachment to the vine is coursing with life
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.760]   or is merely artificial and external.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.000]   Here's verse eight, by this my father is glorified
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.740]   So fruitfully abiding with life, love, joy,
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.040]   coursing into us through the connection
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   between us and the vine, prove us to be disciples.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.600]   Verses seven and eight, abiding and fruit bearing,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.920]   confirm us, the negative is also true.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.640]   Verse six, if anyone does not abide in me,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.200]   he is thrown away like a branch and withers
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.280]   and the branches are gathered and thrown into the fire.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.080]   And earlier in verses one and two,
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.060]   if anyone doesn't bear fruit, he's taken away.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.600]   Now this is what provokes Casey's question
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.640]   about perseverance or eternal security.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.300]   Can we be born of God?
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.600]   Can we be authentically in a living way,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.560]   united to Christ, truly Christian and lose our salvation?
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.120]   Now in John's understanding,
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.220]   in the writer's understanding of abiding,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.440]   the answer is no, we can't.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.280]   I say this for two reasons.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.000]   In chapter 10, verse 28, he says, quoting Jesus,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.720]   I give them eternal life.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.120]   They shall never perish.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.400]   No one will snatch them out of my hand.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.960]   My father who has given them to me is greater than all
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.560]   and no one is able to snatch them out of my father's hand.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.200]   He's bending over backwards to say,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.060]   when I choose someone for myself and they hear my voice
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.320]   and I take them to be my sheep and my children,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.560]   that never changes.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.040]   Here's the second reason I think John means this,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.520]   and it's the answer to what in the world is going on
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.920]   with broken off branches.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.640]   I think 1 John 2.19 is a description in the church
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:50.260]   of what it means that certain branches are broken off.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.440]   It says, they went out from us,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.860]   that is they were broken off,
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.400]   but they were not of us.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.000]   For if they had been of us,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   they would have continued, that is remained, abided with us,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.320]   but they went out that it might become plain
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.040]   that they are not of us.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.360]   So I think John provides us with the category
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.960]   for understanding a kind of superficial,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.440]   external attachment to Jesus
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.980]   that is not a saving attachment
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.260]   and can result in a fruitless, empty life
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.000]   where there's no sap coursing and be broken off,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   that is fall away from the church, but never were of us.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.540]   Here's number five, fifth observation.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.020]   The branches are being cared for both internally
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.460]   by the life of Christ flowing into us
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.240]   and externally by the vine dresser who prunes us.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.160]   This is amazing.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.800]   I didn't see this until just a few years ago
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.320]   when I preached on this at one of the conferences.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.440]   Jesus says in verse one,
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   "I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.160]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   Every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.400]   that it may bear more fruit."
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.660]   Now pruning means cut, cut.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.460]   So the branches are being cared for
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.820]   to make them maximally fruitful,
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.820]   both by internal life flowing to us from the vine
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.700]   and by a vine dresser who with his very painful scissors
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.100]   or saw cuts us, hurts us,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.760]   so that by these painful providences in life,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.860]   we experience the fullest possible impact
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.460]   of the inner life of Christ.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.720]   So we are being cared for both internally
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   by Christ's life coursing into us by the spirit
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.880]   and externally by the providences of a loving father
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.720]   who knows how to discipline his children
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.140]   to make them very, very holy.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.460]   And my last observation about abiding
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.040]   is the goal of abiding is the glory of God.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.240]   Verse eight, "By this is my father glorified
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.420]   that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples."
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.420]   The whole design of our not being the vine,
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.400]   but being the utterly dependent branches
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.320]   grafted into the vine,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.240]   the whole design of depending on a vine dresser
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   to manage the outward shape of our vine structure
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.680]   and our branch structure,
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.320]   that whole design is so that God gets the glory
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   for bringing it all about.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.840]   So bottom line, hour by hour,
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   let us receive and rest in and trust
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   and savor and enjoy Christ's word and love and joy
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.640]   while we submit externally
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.620]   to the merciful providences of God.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.080]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.480]   11 minutes.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.020]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.920]   - We'll try better next time.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.760]   - Yes, we will.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.600]   - I'm playing with Pastor John here, folks.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   Casey, thank you for the question
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.080]   and thank you for listening
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.320]   and making the podcast a part of your day
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.600]   and commute for yet another week.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.880]   Three times a week we publish
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.120]   and keep up with new episodes that we release.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.160]   And you can search our old episodes in our archive
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.200]   and even reach us by email
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.600]   with a question you may be facing in your life like this one.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.120]   Do all that through our online home
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.600]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   Well, on Monday, we're going to talk about the Lord's Supper
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.840]   specifically whether the celebration
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.440]   is supposed to be somber
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   or whether it's supposed to be cheerful.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.880]   What is the proper mood to the Lord's table?
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.800]   That's on the docket when we return on Monday.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.680]   We will see you then.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.760]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
