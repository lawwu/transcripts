[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   [silence]
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.600]   We've all heard of the opioid crisis by now,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.520]   or at least most of you have.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.800]   The opioid crisis refers specifically
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.140]   to people taking exogenous opioids, taking opioids, right?
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.840]   So taking pills that activate particular receptors
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.800]   in the brain that lead to analgesia in some cases,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.680]   so pain relief that lead to changes in mood.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.480]   There's a lot to be said about the opioid crisis.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.120]   It's called a crisis for a reason.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.400]   Many, many people are addicted to those compounds.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.840]   That's a discussion for another time.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.180]   Keep in mind that the receptors those drugs bind to
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.880]   are opioid receptors.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.400]   And those receptors that you and I all have, by the way,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.180]   do not exist in order to bind drugs
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.160]   that are made by pharmaceutical companies.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.000]   They exist in our brain and body
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.080]   to bind to the so-called endogenous,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.640]   naturally made opioids that we all make.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.120]   And those receptors have different names.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.840]   The mu-opioid receptor, the kappa-opioid receptor, et cetera.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.880]   They tend to have the names of Greek letters
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.800]   to differentiate them.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   Now, ketamine can bind to various opioid receptors.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.180]   And when opioid receptors are bound,
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.600]   we know that creates certain effects,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.440]   things like pain relief,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.120]   things like changes in psychic states,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   dissociation, for example.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.340]   If enough of them are bound, you can get euphoric states.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.480]   Under certain conditions of high dose binding of ketamine
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.000]   to those opioid receptors,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.140]   you can start getting into planes of anesthesia
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.520]   where people lose consciousness
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.120]   and actually have no response to pain whatsoever.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.960]   If you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.440]   where ketamine was used to relieve depression,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.620]   well, the dosage used in that study, as you recall,
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.940]   was half a milligram per kilogram of body weight.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.140]   That is the dosage that will induce these dissociative,
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.600]   mild euphoria, those sorts of states of mind,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.760]   but where people are still conscious.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.700]   When you start getting to dosages of ketamine
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.840]   that are in the range of one to two milligrams
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.200]   per kilogram of body weight,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   now you're talking about anesthetic doses.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   And when that happens, you're going to get full parking,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.520]   full saturation of all the potential receptors
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   that ketamine can bind to.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080]   Those NMDA receptors, it's going to block those.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.920]   It's also going to bind
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   to the so-called mu-opioid receptors,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.660]   and maybe this other type as well,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.640]   for those of you that want to know, uficionados,
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.200]   also the kappa-type opioid receptors.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.480]   And so what we've got here is a drug, ketamine,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.160]   that is hitting two different systems,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.200]   the glutamate-related system
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.880]   and the endogenous opioid system.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.320]   And researchers and clinicians
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.000]   have logically started to ask whether or not
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.120]   some or all of the effects of ketamine
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.720]   are due to the opioid system,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   and they want to know which effects those are.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.880]   Now, this is where things start to get really interesting,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.280]   both in the context of clinical treatment of depression
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.320]   and recreational use.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280]   First of all, when people take ketamine,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   again, it enters the bloodstream and it goes into the brain,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.700]   but it is metabolized to something called HNK,
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.360]   which is hydroxynorketamine.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.440]   Now, I don't expect you to know
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.080]   what hydroxynorketamine is,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600]   and I don't expect you to care about it
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.560]   until I tell you what I'm about to tell you,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.520]   which is that hydroxynorketamine
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.400]   has an incredible specificity for the mu-opioid receptor,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.960]   and maybe that kappa-opioid receptor as well.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.800]   In other words, when we talk about ketamine,
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.480]   that's the drug people take,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.920]   but when it goes into the body,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.520]   it's converted into yet another drug,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.780]   and that other drug, hydroxynorketamine,
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.920]   is selectively activating the opioid system.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.260]   So this led researchers to ask it a very important question,
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.000]   which is when a human being takes ketamine
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.080]   in order to treat their depression
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.680]   and they get some relief from depression,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.300]   is that the consequence of neuroplastic changes
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.040]   and all those NMDA, glutamate, BDNF-related circuits
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.580]   that we talked about before?
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.420]   Or is it the consequence of something happening
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.920]   in the opioid system?
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.600]   You can't ignore the fact that ketamine has this property
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.720]   of binding to these opioid receptors
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.640]   because they have such a powerful effect on our thinking,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.480]   on our mood, on our state of consciousness.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's entirely reasonable that the opioid system
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.200]   could be a major player, if not the major player,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.160]   in this whole depression relief thing,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   and maybe even in the creation of dissociative symptomology
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.280]   when people take ketamine recreationally.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.260]   So what researchers/clinicians did
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.860]   is they undertook a series of experiments
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.180]   where they gave people ketamine
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.820]   for the relief of depression,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.880]   but they also blocked the opioid receptor system.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.740]   And they did that using a drug called naltrexone.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.100]   So what I'm about to describe to you
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.580]   is a study done by my colleagues
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.260]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.500]   namely Dr. Nolan Williams and Alan Schatzberg
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.180]   and colleagues, entitled "Attenuation of Antidepressant
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.580]   and Antisuicidal Effects of Ketamine
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.080]   by Opioid Receptor Antagonism."
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.400]   And as a consequence of me reading you
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.800]   that title a moment ago,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.680]   you now already have the conclusion of the study.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   What they observed is that when people were given ketamine,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.920]   they got relief from depression.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.880]   That wasn't surprising.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.700]   Again, many studies had shown that before,
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.060]   since the early 2000s.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.800]   If, however, individuals were given naltrexone
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.360]   to block the opioid receptor pathway,
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.680]   and they were given ketamine,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.880]   well, then the antidepressant effects of ketamine
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.560]   were no longer observed.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.000]   Now, that suggests that it is the opioid receptor system
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.620]   that's responsible for the antidepressant effects
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.460]   of ketamine.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.520]   And perhaps this HNK, this hydroxynorketamine,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.400]   which is the metabolite of ketamine,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.280]   is the way in which ketamine normally relieves depression.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.200]   Now, a lot of people took note of these studies
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.660]   because after all, there are probably dozens,
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.440]   if not hundreds of studies looking at the effects
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.120]   of ketamine on all that NMDA receptor stuff.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.160]   And indeed, neuroplasticity and mood-related circuits
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.880]   can't be discounted as one way in which ketamine
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.360]   provides relief from depression.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.760]   But what was very interesting is that in people given
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.200]   ketamine and naltrexone,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.960]   those people still experienced the immediate effects
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.480]   of ketamine, the mild euphoria, the dissociation,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.560]   the feelings that one would normally expect
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.120]   when people were under the effects of ketamine.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   But what they didn't get were the longer term changes
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.400]   in mood that we would call relief from depression.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.440]   Now, of course, the goal of modern psychiatry
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.120]   is to treat depression, not to block the effects
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.520]   of these drugs that are capable of treating depression.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.860]   Now, what this study does, and by the way,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.440]   there are several studies like it
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.400]   that support these general set of findings
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.040]   that part of the critical role of ketamine
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.600]   in providing relief from depression
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.460]   is to activate the opioid system.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.600]   But what this study does is it really points to the fact
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.320]   that when we say ketamine treatment,
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.000]   or we talk about somebody taking ketamine recreationally,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   for that matter, we have to pay attention
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.740]   to what's happening while they are under the influence
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.280]   of the drug.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.000]   We also have to pay attention to what's happening
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.280]   in the days and weeks after they're under the influence
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.120]   of the drug.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.040]   And perhaps most importantly, this calls to mind
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.520]   a really important idea, which is that whether or not
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.140]   you're talking about ketamine induced relief
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.360]   from depression, or psilocybin induced relief
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   for depression, or MDMA induced relief for PTSD,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.400]   a topic that I covered on a previous episode
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.640]   of this podcast, we have to step back
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.680]   and look at the idea that the effects of the drug
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.560]   that people experience, whatever those may be,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.940]   because obviously it's going to depend
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.500]   on what particular drug they took,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.000]   those immediate effects may not actually be related
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.800]   to the long-term clinical benefit
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.760]   of those particular drugs.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.040]   Now, I realize that many people might not like that idea.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.640]   And frankly, I don't actually think
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   that's the way that it works.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.920]   I don't think it's going to be an either or situation.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.120]   However, because drugs like ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.320]   have such profound effects on people's psychic states
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.040]   when they are under the influence of them.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.600]   And because at least in the proper clinical setting and use,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.840]   they do seem to provide impressive relief
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.500]   from a lot of these psychiatric challenges
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.720]   like depression and PTSD.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   People naturally correlate those two things.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.480]   They couple those two things.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.160]   In fact, they collapse those two things
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.240]   and presume that their experience of what they saw,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.640]   what they heard, how they felt
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.680]   while they were under the influence of the drug
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.900]   was actually the stimulus that created the relief
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.920]   from their clinical condition like depression.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.720]   But what these data on combined treatment
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.320]   with ketamine and naltrexone
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.480]   to block the mu opioid receptor really show us
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.640]   is that that may not actually be the way that it works.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.520]   It may be that the effects of a drug like ketamine
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.800]   that one experiences, while interesting,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.120]   perhaps even profound, perhaps great insight comes to one
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.900]   when they do that therapy in the proper context,
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.160]   it is not clear at all that it is that experience
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.560]   and the effects of those drugs
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.600]   in those immediate minutes and hours
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.480]   that's actually what's causing the relief from depression.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.400]   Now, again, I don't think it's an either or.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.840]   I like to view the whole situation more or less
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.760]   as a sort of wave front
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.900]   that the experience that one has subjectively
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.600]   while they are under the influence of a drug
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   like ketamine or psilocybin or MDMA sets off a series.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.100]   And in fact, multiple series, is that a word?
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.660]   Multiple types of processes in the brain,
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.500]   some of which rely on things like NMDA receptor,
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.300]   BDNF, et cetera, type neuroplasticity,
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.380]   others which rely on the opioid receptor pathway.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.260]   And that each of these have different time courses
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.800]   such that some provide immediate relief
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.460]   in the days and hours after treatment,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.540]   some in the weeks after treatment,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.260]   and some more durable, long-lasting changes
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.680]   that can occur over months or maybe even years.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.260]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.180]   (upbeat music)
