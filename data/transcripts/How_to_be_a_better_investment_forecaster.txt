[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.260]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.900]   And in this episode, I want to talk about inflation.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.180]   Because great news, the October inflation numbers
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.180]   came out on November 10th.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.020]   And they came in below expectations.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.060]   October consumer prices plus 0.4%
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.540]   versus consensus of plus 0.6%.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.660]   October CPI, x food and energy, came in at plus 0.3%
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.660]   versus consensus of plus 0.5%.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.460]   And then October consumer prices overall
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.900]   increased 7.7% from a year earlier.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.060]   And core CPI was up 6.3% year over year.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.820]   And what's pretty cool is that you heard a podcast episode
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.140]   just a couple episodes ago talking
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.700]   about the most bullish economic indicator yet.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.460]   And that bullish indicator, as you recall,
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.660]   was a lower series I bond rate, lower by 2.7%.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.420]   And the general thesis was inflation has clearly peaked.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.820]   The government has shown its cards.
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.420]   And the upcoming inflation numbers
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.300]   reported in November, December, January, February,
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.660]   March will likely be overall below expectations.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.820]   Or individual months will be below expectations.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.380]   So right now, we're spot on.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.860]   We've got October numbers coming in below expectations.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.660]   And what's happening with the stock market?
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.100]   The stock market is up 4%.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.580]   The NASDAQ is up over 5.5%.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.660]   So clearly, investors like this print
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.220]   because it shows that inflation really is rolling over.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.380]   And there's hope now that the Fed
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.620]   won't hike as aggressively in December, January, and February.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.820]   I think it's really important to know that once inflation turns,
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.140]   it can turn down very quickly, just like how inflation turned
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.460]   up very quickly.
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.340]   And as a result, interest rates can also turn up and then also
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.940]   turn down very quickly.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.060]   So a 10-year bond yield at 3.8%, that's a 30 basis point
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.340]   move in just one day.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.220]   That's huge.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.780]   That's like a two standard deviation move.
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.900]   So you will see mortgage rates concurrently, on average,
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.620]   go down about 30 basis points.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.300]   So let's say 6.5% mortgage, you can now
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   get it at 6.2%.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.580]   And again, with the series I bond collapsing by 2.7%,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.380]   and given the rate is for six months,
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.820]   I can very easily imagine where the average mortgage rate will
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.900]   be down between 2% to 3%.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.380]   So in other words, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.940]   could decline to 4.5% to 5.5%.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.740]   And the reason why is because everything
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.060]   is correlated in finance.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.100]   Everything is correlated to a risk-free rate and the series
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.140]   I bond rate.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.060]   It's not a great example of a risk-free rate,
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.700]   given there's a $10,000 limit per person,
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.860]   but it is a risk-free rate nonetheless.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.580]   And the government has to be consistent with its offerings.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.380]   It can't say, OK, the next six months,
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.660]   we're going to offer 6.7% on the series I bond,
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.060]   but inflation is still at 8%, because then people
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.820]   will be like, well, why bother investing in such a lower rate
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.220]   when before you were offering 9.6% on the series I bond?
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.980]   Everything is relative to the risk-free rate return.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.420]   You've got to think about that as an investor.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.940]   Another thing to consider is how come more PhD economists
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.620]   and highly paid Wall Street strategists
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.580]   didn't recognize upcoming inflation figures will likely
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.700]   come in below expectations?
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.700]   Expectations are the expectations.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.940]   So how did these numbers come in below expectations?
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.940]   They get paid a lot.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.260]   They spend 40-plus hours a week crunching the numbers,
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.340]   looking at the research, and so forth.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.860]   So how did they miss that?
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.380]   Conversely, how does a tired, stay-at-home dad
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.220]   who hasn't worked in finance in over 10 years
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.860]   get the call correctly?
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.940]   And to give you an idea of what I'm up to,
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.180]   it's right now 10:05 AM on November 10,
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.140]   and I'm sitting in my car a block away from the hospital
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.940]   because I just dropped off my wife and daughter
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.700]   for a nose and ear and throat checkup.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.620]   So the first important thing to know
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.300]   is that skin in the game matters.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.820]   If you're just pontificating with no money at stake,
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.780]   it's harder to connect the dots.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.900]   There is no financial pain if you get your call wrong.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.780]   And if you rely on investments to take care of your family,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.540]   as I do, you will experience max pain if you mess things up.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.740]   This situation is akin to being a PhD researcher
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.500]   about retirement who has gainful employment
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.060]   and a wonderful pension waiting for them.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.140]   You know, they can research all they want
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.980]   about retirement lifestyle, withdraw rates,
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.900]   once you retire, and more, but unless you eject,
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.860]   press that eject button, and no longer have
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.500]   biweekly paycheck and a pension,
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.700]   what you think about retirement will be pretty different
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.420]   from what you model out.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.220]   Personally, I can't afford to be too wrong
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.660]   with my investments because my investments
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.220]   are what generate enough passive income
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.620]   so both my wife and I don't have to work
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.100]   until our kids go to school full-time.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.180]   You know, this time is precious,
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.500]   and we can't afford to lose this time.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.820]   So having financial exposure is very important
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.100]   for making better forecasts.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.940]   It's kind of like when you're arguing with a friend
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.180]   and she believes one thing, you believe another,
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.540]   and you just say, "Look, let's bet."
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.580]   And once you say, "Let's bet," that puts skin in the game,
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.420]   that crystallizes the odds, and if you really believe
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.820]   in what you're saying, then you'd be willing to bet.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.660]   Otherwise, you'll just shy away.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.180]   All right, two, you wanna invite dissension,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.900]   people who disagree with you.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.740]   Getting things wrong is a part of investing.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.020]   Therefore, listen to people who have an opposing view.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.500]   You can publish your thesis or talk about your thesis
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.820]   and invite others to tear it up
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.540]   because finding your blind spots is really key.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.900]   You won't know what you don't know.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.460]   So with Financial Samurai, I have this platform
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.740]   where I can publish a post, and then people can comment
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.260]   and say, "You're an idiot.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.480]   "I agree with you.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.020]   "Have you looked into this and this and that?"
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.860]   It is vital to see the other point of view,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.300]   the other side of the story,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.760]   because if you just have people saying,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.720]   "Yes, sir, yes, ma'am, I agree with you.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.080]   "I love your thesis."
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.820]   Whatever it is, you are gonna develop these blind spots,
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.980]   and you might suddenly think your poop doesn't stink
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.380]   and you're just God's gift to earth.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.940]   But the reality is every experienced investor
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.060]   has lost a ton of money before.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.300]   Hopefully, we can all get it right at least 51% of the time.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.740]   If we do, we're gonna win long-term.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740]   But in the short term, it's really hard,
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.140]   and you need to at least call the direction.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.020]   Once you get that direction correct,
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.980]   then you can look into the minutia.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.240]   Please uncover your blind spots.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.280]   All right, three, don't be delusional.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.920]   All right, post-mortem analysis is very important.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.120]   Ask yourself, did you get the call right
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.880]   because of your reasonings or because of something else?
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.980]   Because if you confuse your reasonings with something else,
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.580]   you're gonna be delusional.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.200]   Let's use an example.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.120]   Let's say you predict so-and-so
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.920]   is gonna win the tennis match,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.840]   and you predict because the forehand,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.000]   the person's forehand is better and they're fitter.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.660]   And the person ends up winning.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.160]   So you're suddenly thinking, ah, you're a genius.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   But the real reason why your person won
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.000]   was because the opponent had a stomach tear,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.680]   and he twisted his ankle, and he was getting over a cold,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.760]   so he couldn't perform to 110% of his ability.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   If you don't know that,
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.680]   then you are going to over-optimize
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   on betting on the person you thought
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.280]   who would win, and over the long run,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.480]   you might get very frustrated when that person doesn't win
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   because of your reasoning.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.040]   The same thing goes if you got your investment thesis wrong,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.960]   but the results turned out correctly.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.400]   Please don't forget that you got your investment thesis
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.280]   wrong, and basically luck bailed you out.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.400]   Very important.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.560]   Don't confuse being born on third base
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.880]   with hitting a home run.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.320]   All right, final point here on how to be
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.520]   a better forecaster and hopefully a better investor,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.840]   because it is hard.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   Man in the Arena, a great speech
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.680]   by President Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.160]   Here is part of the speech.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.000]   It is not the critic who counts,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.140]   not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.360]   or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.840]   The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.200]   whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.600]   who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.080]   and again because there is no effort without error
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.640]   and shortcoming, but who does actually strive
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.200]   to do the deeds, who knows great enthusiasms,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.800]   the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.840]   who at the best knows in the end the triumph
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.000]   of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.600]   at least fails while daring greatly,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.120]   so that his place shall never be with those cold
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.080]   I love this speech.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.320]   I have the speech hung up in my bathroom,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.120]   so every morning I see it to not give up.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.800]   Except you will get plenty of calls wrong
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.040]   and lose money in the future.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.480]   That's just the way investing is.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.340]   But stay humble and recognize luck.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.080]   To achieve financial independence,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.440]   to make money on risk assets, you must continue to battle
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   and suppress the fear of looking like an idiot
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.640]   by taking calculated risks.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.680]   Think about it.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.640]   When I was coming up with my investment thesis
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.220]   on the most bullish indicator I've seen this year,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.320]   I was kind of concerned.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   I was afraid, like, is this investment thesis correct?
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.480]   Will readers and listeners think I'm a dumbass?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.840]   But then I thought to myself,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.440]   well, I look like a dumbass all the time
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.280]   based on my writing and my podcast.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.080]   Hey, y'all tell me that all the time in the comments
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.180]   and I've come to embrace it, right?
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.160]   So I wanna look at those blind spots
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.840]   and I wanna do my due diligence and figure things out.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.200]   And I said, you know what?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.920]   People get things wrong all the time,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.480]   but you know that if you don't try,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.160]   if you're not in the arena,
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.840]   putting out your investment thesis,
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.280]   battling it out on the tennis court or on the pitch,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.820]   you're never going to win.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.400]   You're never gonna win at all.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.200]   The reality for me is that money is too important
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.360]   to be left up to pontification and just winging it.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.680]   It's one of the reasons why I started this podcast
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.640]   and why I started Financial Samurai in 2009,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.120]   because writing and recording this voice
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.720]   helps me think things through.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.160]   Because when I write, I've often discovered,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.840]   ah, I missed something.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.640]   And it just really helps crystallize
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.120]   and make you think more purposefully.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.200]   So I highly suggest it for all of you
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   before you make an investment thesis or investment decision.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.680]   Moving forward, I'm pretty confident
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.600]   the worst is over for this bear market.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   3577 on the S&P 500 reached in mid-October, 2022.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.760]   Hopefully, likely is the bottom.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.880]   As a result, psychologically, mentally,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.520]   I feel more at peace that we're not gonna go down
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.480]   to the depths of despair like we did
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.000]   during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.880]   However, the X factor is whether the Fed
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.040]   will really recognize, verbally, publicly recognize
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.920]   that inflation has peaked and that they will slow down.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.720]   They are the X factor.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.040]   And I hope that my podcast and my articles,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.160]   just speaking out will help pressure them
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.640]   to be more balanced and thoughtful
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.560]   for the middle class going forward.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.000]   Because the last thing we want
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.360]   is to have millions of people unemployed
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.240]   for the sake of pushing down headline inflation
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.840]   by two or 3%.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   Yeah, inflation stings, but losing your job,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.760]   losing your livelihood, stings even worse.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.400]   All righty, if you enjoyed this podcast,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.040]   I'd love a positive review and a share with your friends.
