[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, we are to fear God and we are to flee to God.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And while those two things, fearing God and fleeing to Him, may sound oddly contradictory,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   they're not.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.500]   In 2008, Pastor John preached on Psalm 103, a psalm with some pretty amazing statements
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500]   about God's love to those who fear Him.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   Verse 11 says, "For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His steadfast
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500]   love towards those who fear Him."
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500]   And in verse 13 it says, "As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000]   compassion to those who fear Him."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.500]   And in verse 17 it says, "The steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000]   on those who fear Him."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500]   God's covenant love is for those who fear Him.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.000]   And the following sermon clip comes from Michael, who lives in the beautiful city of San Diego.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500]   Here's John Piper expounding Psalm 103.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.000]   The only people that will eternally experience the love of God as the love of God
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   are people who fear the Lord.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   Is that a separate and distinct requirement over against keeping covenant with Christ,
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000]   by trusting His new covenant provisions?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.500]   I don't think so.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   Here's what I think fearing God means today.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   I think fearing God means that God is, in your mind and heart, so powerful and so holy
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:08.000]   and so awesome that you would not dare to run away from Him, but only run to Him.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   In other words, fearing God is not another requirement.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500]   It's the way you do covenant keeping.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   It's the way you receive Jesus.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   It's the way you come to Jesus.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   You come reverently.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.000]   You come humbly.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.500]   You come without any presumption that you deserve anything or He owes you anything.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   You come trembling, or as we saw in Psalm 51,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   you come with a heart that is broken and contrite.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   Tremble if you ever feel any inclination to leave this God.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   There is only destruction away from Him.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   Oh, how we should fear to leave the Lord,
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   and tremble in His presence that He would so graciously receive us,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   forgive all of our sins, and make an everlasting future.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   And so many people do not fear their carnal departures.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   They don't tremble.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   So, my answer to how these two requirements,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   the covenant keeping one where you fly to Jesus for His blood and righteousness
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   and hold fast to Him as your only hope,
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   and the first one fearing this is just the way you fly.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   Your faith in this Christ and your flying to Him desperate and fearful
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   that you would turn to any other resource
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   must be real.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   Can't play games.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   And the Bible is so amply plain that if you have come to Him as Savior,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   if you have come to Him as King,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   if you have come to Him as treasure,
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   if you have flown to Him with trembling that you could go any other place,
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   it's going to change your life.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   Period.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   It's going to change your life.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   It cannot not change you if it's real.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   So, we've been together long enough, although there are a lot of guests.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   You know I don't believe in Christian perfection.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   It ain't going to happen in this age.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   Not a single person will live a single day perfectly.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   Okay?
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   Just get that away.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   However, you cannot make sense out of the Bible if you don't say
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   obedience to the commandments as a trajectory of life,
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   repenting of failures,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   confessing sins,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   and getting back on has got to happen.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   In other words, the central requirement,
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   the law of keeping through faith in Jesus has got to be real,
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   and obedience is the evidence that it's real.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   It's the sign that it's real.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   It's the mark that it's real.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   It's the fruit that says the tree's real.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Dads, we would lay our lives down, wouldn't we,
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   for that to happen in our children.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   Because if it doesn't happen,
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   they will cease to experience the love of God when they die.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   And they will experience only wrath from then on.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   It's called hell.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   And they will cease to experience the righteousness of God as maintaining some kind of order and justice in the world.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   And they will experience the righteousness of God only as condemnation from the Holy Judge forever
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   if our children do not experience covenant keeping,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   fearing God,
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.500]   and the evidence of obedience.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   That's why we have families.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   That's why fathers exist, to do the impossible,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   and to bring our children to that place.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   To do the impossible, yeah, that is the true burden of fatherhood,
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   of bringing into this world eternal beings who must know and understand the wrath of God
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   and flee from it in Christ.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   Sobering call for dads and for moms, fearing God and fleeing to God in Christ.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   This clip came in from Michael in San Diego.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   Thank you very much, Michael.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   All of our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   And we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.500]   If you have one, email it to me.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   the timestamp of when the clip happens in the audio,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   Well, thanks to the smartphone, online dating is now the most common way couples meet.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   Not through friends, not at school, not in church.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   The vast majority of couples now meet online through apps.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   Finding a new date has never been easier.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.500]   You just swipe to the right, and that ease is posing a new problem for serial daters.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   We'll find out what that is next time.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   We're rejoined in studio with Pastor John when he returns with us on Friday.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   [no audio]
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   [no audio]
