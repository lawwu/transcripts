[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.660]   No, Darwin does that because instead of observing how things actually work, they were trying to carry out an agenda.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.660]   So he creates these ideas and he said, under these ideas, you people can do what you want.

[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:29.740]   And if you were, for example, to extend the privileges of partial autonomy among school kids,
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:38.740]   you would shrink the establishment and that is no way they retain power or income.

[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:25.920]   and the sense of powers behind it.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:25.920]   It's behind the scenes very, very strong. Let me give you a few specifics. It's been clear since the beginning of standardized testing that the tests do not predict.

[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:41.400]   But actually, as Harvard and Princeton told me, it's not a significant determinant. They just don't want to rock the boat, the glue that holds this pyramid together.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:55.420]   They don't predict. And why is 10% of the school year and school budget devoted to exerting stress on so many millions of people?

Instead of going to the recognized engineers and blowing all their water on one shot, on the internet they globally put out to anyone at all, from any background at all, they wanted a theory.
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:33.960]   They wanted a theory of how to find that ore body. And somebody who had nothing to do with mining, pick up the book, because I'm losing the richness of the details.
