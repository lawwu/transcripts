[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.300]   ♪
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.300]   [beep]
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.300]   Sound?
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.300]   Yep.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.300]   Alright.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.300]   [inaudible]
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.300]   I'm going to slate.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300]   It's a day with John Taylor Gatto, roll three.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.300]   [clap]
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300]   I dropped my handkerchief.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.300]   When we left off, we were talking about how the committees were investigating the foundations.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300]   So there was a Cox committee, there was a Reese committee,
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.300]   they were looking into the origins of the education system and what is it really doing
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.300]   versus what do people need to survive and thrive in this world.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.300]   And they discovered there was more than a crevasse, more than a Grand Canyon.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.300]   There was a gap between what we need to survive and thrive and be successful entrepreneurs
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.300]   pursuing the American dream with a real hope of attaining it versus being a servile class.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300]   And these committees kind of snapshot it and said that there's some foundations
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.300]   and there's some things in action and they're trying to evoke real change
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.300]   and they're going after our children.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.300]   They were puzzled because they detected an agenda,
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.300]   but they couldn't figure the agenda out.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.300]   And with the second commission, the Reese, a firestorm broke loose.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   In fact, Reese was never able to finish thanks to the chief counsel.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   Was that Cox?
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.300]   The chief counsel, well I know there was a lawyer involved with the Reese committee,
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.300]   Catherine Casey, who was the lawyer sent by Norman Dodd to go into the archives
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.300]   of the Carnegie Foundation.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   And after being brought up in a traditional status quo education,
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   she went there and saw the actual minutes and the words of these men in these meetings
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   planning on how to take over this country and to take over the diplomacy and power of war.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   Was Dodd the chief counsel for Reese?
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   Dodd was the chief researcher.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   He was out of J.P. Morgan earlier and he had said,
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300]   "You guys need to return to sound banking."
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   And they said, "Norm, we're going to let you go."
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   And then Carol Reese had called him up and said,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   "Norm, we want you to head up research because we think --"
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   What they were describing is communist activity from my research,
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   like in the comprehensive sense.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   Well, they didn't see clearly.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   That was the bet noire of the moment.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   And so that was the easiest way to organize,
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   but it was something far, far more profound than communism.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   Yes.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   Right.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   So that gets back into Pestalozzi, Lavater,
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300]   other people who were intellectual elites who joined clubs.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.300]   It's like the Bavarian Illuminati was one such club
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   that has a lot of the intellectual elite of the area getting together,
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.300]   and in their drawing rooms, they're drawing out the plans for other people's lives.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   And they basically, when you look at the origins of our education system in America,
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.300]   it goes directly back to Adam Weisshoff's plans,
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   which are planned on earlier plans,
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.300]   but still there is an organized effort to go after our education system.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   Well, there's one more recent than that.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.300]   There was the Metaphysical Club at Harvard right around the turn of the 20th century,
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   and it contained such muscular figures as William James,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.300]   who is the reason we have a course in college's academic psychology.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   That's James' prestige brought that in, and James was a kind of--
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   he had a ligature to Wundt, although Wundt intimidated James a bit,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.300]   because he wrote so much and so copiously about everything.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   In the Metaphysical Club, besides William James, was John Dewey,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   Oliver Wendell Holmes, and a number of other of the shapers of 20th century American institutions.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.300]   The most important figure, though, is not known to many people.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   He's perhaps the last major philosopher human history has produced.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   He was--it's pronounced Pears, but it's spelled as if it were Pierce.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:26.300]   Charles S. Pierce, a strange figure, a part-time lecturer at Harvard,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   created the pragmatic philosophy that William James was probably the chief distributor of.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.300]   But your key man's Pierce, because he's much less--how would I put it?
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.300]   He's much more direct than James.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   James comes from a long intellectual tradition, a genteel tradition,
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.300]   and in a sense, James knows just what to say in every situation.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   Pierce is very nakedly describing that pragmatism--he doesn't make this connection, but I have--
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   is very similar to the Old Norse religion that said, "Praise Ice when crossed, a woman on her deathbed."
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.300]   In other words, no predeterminations until you see performance.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   Pierce said that truth and justice flatly do not exist.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.300]   This was picked up, by the way, by Oliver Wendell Holmes,
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:48.300]   who then said truth and justice are what the strongest members of society say they are,
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:56.300]   and any sane judge decides a case before he hears the arguments,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   because you don't want to rattle the framework of society.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.300]   I mean, this is big-time radicalism.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.300]   Of course, they didn't see it that way at all.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:20.300]   They saw it as nitty-gritty truth, and all these superstitious, sentimental additions had occluded the fact
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.300]   justice is what strong people say it is.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   Truth is the same thing.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.300]   So that's an evolution of Kantian philosophy, where they remove cause and effect,
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   and then their irrationality can be rationalized.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.300]   Yes, of course, they left out Kant's...
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   Is it...
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.300]   It's one of the three critiques.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:56.300]   Probably the best intellectual defense for the existence of God is from Kant.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.300]   That was inconvenient for this group.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   But pragmatism, if you now connect pragmatism with the concept of justified sinning from Calvin,
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:18.300]   you have an absolute blank check in any situation to invent truth, invent justice,
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   sacrifice biologically inconsequential people, and invent any excuse for doing that you want.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:42.300]   It seems to me that's been the driving force in American affairs for a long, long time there.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   But interestingly enough, it's been the driving force of an intellectual elite, I believe through history.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   It's just they didn't have the dominance that technology gave them.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   Well, Bertrand Russell has this quote.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   He's often misquoted, but when you actually read the book, the sentence starts with,
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   I'll paraphrase, "As Fischt would have wanted, the purpose of education is to remove individuality
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   and self-reliance and all these other things."
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   The idea was that Bertrand Russell was noticing that what Fischt in the 19th century was trying to do,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   but didn't have the technology to do, that they now in the Norbert Wiener, Bertrand Russell era of the 20th century,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:34.300]   now had the ability to mass mind control billions of people at the same time.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.300]   It's all done on a basis of irrationality, a denial of cause and effect.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:46.300]   That goes back, you can start looking at where the influence of utopia took place and took root
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   in Francis Bacon with New Atlantis and how it goes up.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   Then it's just formalized by some people using other jargon, psychology in the 20th century, the pragmatism.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   It's all just, they want to do what they want to do anyway,
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   and they just keep using education to say, "Well, this is a good reason why we're doing this."
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, here we are then.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   What thoughts do you have about the amount of people on the origins of this country that were literate
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.300]   versus the amount of people that are literate today?
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   It's quite fascinating because the political census of Connecticut, I believe it was 1690,
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   but don't hold me to that, very, very early on, showed a population that was,
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.300]   for all practical purposes, entirely literate.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:48.300]   We also have the more than circumstantial evidence.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:54.300]   If you simply look at the popular writing in early colonial times,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   it's taught in a seminar level in colleges today.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:13.300]   As well-known a novel as Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans is, in truth, unreadable by college.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   Not because he's not a skillful writer, but the allusions to science, politics, history of all sorts
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   is so comprehensive and interwoven that the allusions themselves defeat an ordinary reader,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   including an ordinary college reader.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   The book I saw in your bathroom, Common Sense, sold 600,000, sold in a population of 3 million.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:11.300]   You know, a country that was half serf, slave, and now you can find it on seminar level in Princeton and University of Chicago.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:17.300]   Because so many people were literate at the origins of this country, they were able to publish these pamphlets.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:24.300]   So when you'd have propaganda on behalf of the elector of Hanover, better known as the King of England,
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   and you had these retorts by Thomas Paine, who's not from America, he emigrated here,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   and he doesn't have a formal education, but somehow he figures out how to put things together for himself
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   and speak in a way such that the common person can really get something from this.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:48.300]   And it's not so much his aspect, his propaganda, he's propagating an idea,
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   but just describe the effect that just being able to have the printing press
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.300]   and somebody who could pick up these ideas without being through their formal schooling
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.300]   has the power to change and influence a country and inspire revolution, etc., etc.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:15.300]   Oh yes. And in Paine's case, what he had mastered is even today when I tell kids it's priceless to master.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   No complexity of ideas can't in fact, with the pains on the part of the speaker, the writer,
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:34.300]   be reduced to plain talk and speech without harming the delicacy of the idea.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   And Paine really hit that on the button. He's quite a model in a sense.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.300]   It's like if you want to write adventure stories, you want to read Edgar Rice Burroughs
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   and the Tarzan books and the Mars books, because you're just propelled from beginning to end
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   on a somewhat more rarefied level. Dickens had that ability.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:10.300]   And of course it could be distributed wholesale, but doing that would hand weapons to people
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   you don't want to be able to be heard.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   You know, when you teach people to speak and think in academies,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   you reduce their effectiveness to their associates.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:39.300]   So yeah, no, we had some very productive experiments in mass literacy,
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.300]   including a phrase, a label that's vanished from use.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   There was constant talk of something called the act of literacy.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   As long as you read well, you can develop original thinking, but you can't communicate it.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:08.300]   But to be able to master spoken speech, you can talk to anybody
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   and they can actually understand what you're saying,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.300]   or written speech were known as the act of literacies.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:24.300]   The British government made those a crime, a prisonable offense to teach ordinary people.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:31.300]   The act of literacy is not reading because you want your flunkies to be able to read
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   so they can follow your orders, so you can go and play golf or go fishing.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:46.300]   But to actually communicate dissident thinking and writing, you can reach way beyond yourself.
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   So the act of literacies are, you find in the handful of elite private boarding schools,
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   this tradition preserved.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:06.300]   In fact, in the academy tradition all over the world, there's a clear understanding
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   that to be able to blink your eyes and knock off 300 words on anything at all,
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   including a subject you know nothing about, is de rigueur.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:26.300]   And so it is to be able to speak fluently, even on things you don't, where you can see.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   And I would love to know how it was done.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:38.300]   The current president is masterful, not just good, he's masterful to nuances of speech
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   that can only happen, doesn't happen naturally.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.300]   There. Where on earth was that training?
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:54.300]   There are little figures he uses that have fancy Latin names to them there.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:04.300]   And of course, Bill Clinton was no slouch, but he comes out of a populist preacher tradition
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   and is masterful with what he does.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:17.300]   But the other is a formally trained science of speech.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   And I listened to the modulations, you know, you can shift from one idiom to another.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   And I said, somebody with this odd background all over the world, who's my daddy, who's my mommy,
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.300]   you know, something intervened there.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.300]   It's no accident, by the way, that Bill Clinton suddenly emerges from a state
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   in which Rockefeller is the governor.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.300]   Who was Bill Clinton's mentor?
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.300]   Well, he has a variety of mentors, the very fact that he steered into Yale,
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:09.300]   which is probably of the elite universities, the one that keeps the class tradition,
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.300]   the British class tradition, most actively alive.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:21.300]   In fact, they all fled from Harvard when the Unitarians took over and are talking,
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   you know, we're all in this together.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:31.300]   So they bailed out of Harvard, headed west, dropped the biggest load,
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:38.300]   no pun intended, in New Haven, but continued on a line that you can trace
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   all the way across to Seattle, leaving behind traces of this brilliant class-based thought.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   I once, years ago, and don't ask me to reclaim it now, but I once actually did trace
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   the movement from the evacuation of Harvard in about 185, 1810.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:12.300]   What had happened was the Unitarians, who were one of the great heresies of,
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:22.300]   you know, the last 500 years, they worked out a way to initially convert
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:30.300]   to whatever religion had a church in the area, and then when they were the majority,
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   they would vote the thing out of business, take the assets, and reopen as a Unitarian parish.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   The entire Massachusetts school committee, no accident, every last member was a Unitarian,
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   even though there were less than 1% of the Massachusetts population,
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.300]   because they understood leverage.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:04.820]   So, how you, the wolf, what is the symbol of the Fabian Socialists in Britain?
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.740]   It's the wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.940]   They have a big laugh at how easy it is.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.940]   You know, to fool...
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:26.460]   The funny thing is that Kitty Mugridge, no, no, no, excuse me, Beatrice Webb, who is really
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.980]   Fabian Socialism, she carried her husband around, but Beatrice is the welfare state
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.860]   architect.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:45.660]   She was the niece of Herbert Spencer, the most articulate intellectual racist in human
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.660]   history.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:59.040]   Roothog, or Die, she sat with him on his deathbed for six weeks, and both of them agreed they
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:06.220]   were after the identical goals, but by different means.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:14.300]   He said, "Exterminate the brutes," the famous line from Heart of Darkness, and she said,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.140]   "Kill them with kindness."
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.340]   You know, I noticed you had Ayn Rand on your shelf.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:29.580]   The idea of taking care of somebody else, apart from the innocent charitable thing,
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.940]   is that you ruin them by doing that.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.540]   It doesn't take very long to ruin them.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:45.780]   So Beatrice Webb, the Fabian, and the great conservative Herbert Spencer, same bloodline,
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.820]   same goals, different methodology.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:54.300]   Fabian Socialists also founded the London School of Economics, among many other things.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:59.660]   Sydney and Beatrice Webb were working with Arthur Balfour in the Society for Psychical
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.660]   Research, I believe.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.500]   One of the other characters that was spinning in that crowd was a guy named William T. Stead,
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:13.140]   who was editor of the Review of the Reviews, died in the Titanic, and was the editor-in-chief
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.100]   over that last Will and Testament of Cecil Johnson.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.900]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:25.860]   And of course, and I have no idea how he pronounced his name, but I would call it Stead, was the
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:36.380]   character in The Lady with the Black Leather, what was, oh, a sort of international spy
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.060]   series on television about 20 years ago.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.860]   Diana Rigg was the female lead.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:51.500]   And Stead was an inside joke.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.060]   Kind of like the James Bond films are an inside joke to MI6 and Ian Fleming's whole career.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.260]   And James Bond was an ornithologist, which is a bird watcher, which is what James Bond
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.260]   is.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.740]   He's watching girls and playing this whole game for the De Beers cartel, which controls.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.620]   And if you believe in justified sinning, that's what a license to kill is.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.340]   As for Her Majesty or whoever.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:21.060]   Well, and Thomas Paine had some words to write about, you know, where monarchies draw their
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.660]   idealistic power and who created crowns and these sort of ideas where somebody is born
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.220]   into a situation where they're allowed to rule over other people, and that's a collectivist
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.580]   mentality where they expect you to sacrifice yourself to the state.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:40.060]   So Prussian schooling is definitely created to uphold that status quo.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.360]   What is the equal and opposite?
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.420]   How do people transition themselves and remain individual and grow and learn and do these
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.420]   things for themselves?
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:58.100]   Well, I think there are a variety of smaller inspirations besides the fact that if you
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:06.860]   and I are correct, it's the natural instinct of people who sort of been made aware of the
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.900]   life and the arc of a life.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:19.580]   But oddly enough, the congregationalists are very little white-spired, beautiful churches
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:28.420]   that once I believe you couldn't vote in this state unless you were one.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:38.060]   They taught that the Presbyterians, as Milton said, "New Presbyter is but old priest writ
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:43.580]   large," because they met together once a year.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:49.580]   And he said, "That will ruin you having this collective mentality."
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:56.140]   The congregation is sovereign in a real congregationalist church.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.300]   I don't know how they've mutated through history.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:10.260]   And the minister is simply the official of the moment to organize the back and forth.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.140]   But the minute the minister becomes cheeky or out of line, out he goes.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:23.080]   And usually if he asks for more money, because the minister is a functionary, the congregation
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.140]   gets the word directly from God.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:34.580]   This is of course Martin Luther's enormous breakthrough, which he couldn't sustain.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:46.300]   That what is probably the great freeing line in human history, every man his own priest.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.940]   No organization is necessary.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.660]   The communication is direct.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:57.220]   Constitutions modified it and said there's some value in other people's opinion, but
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.060]   not too many other.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.900]   The people who show up and donate to the church, yeah, we want to hear what they all have to
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.460]   say.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.180]   But the minister, you know.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:19.540]   So that was one source for a long time, these dissenting and independent religions that
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:27.380]   were unwelcome in Britain came here and there's so much space and it was so disorganized outside
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.380]   of cities.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:34.020]   And we had this infinite splintering.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.500]   So that was one.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:45.700]   I think the scale of the country itself, which couldn't be really monitored until very recently.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:55.100]   Long ago it occurred to me that when you have to depend on say horses, no telephones, no
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:02.660]   iPads, when you get about 20 miles from the center, they don't know what you're doing.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:08.140]   Once a year, blue moon, they send somebody out and you say whatever the guy wants to
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.780]   hear.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.540]   Back goes, it looks like everything's cool.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:22.140]   That's how we had, there are no continuous governments in human history.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:29.380]   None of them last very long and I'm sure it's because this ferment on the fringe, which
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:40.660]   isn't very far away, eventually is fatal to the idea that the hierarchy must be preserved.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.260]   I think that's just a sign that there's so many people in this country.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.460]   When things can get that obviously irrational, that there's just no intellectual self-defense,
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.540]   there's no one left to form a sentence, let alone a paragraph, let alone have the power
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.780]   to get it printed in front of millions of people anymore.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.780]   And that's what I noticed.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:03.300]   And no editor would dare print it anyway for fear the ads would dry up.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:08.980]   Senator Oscar Calaway in 1917 addressed the Congress and he said that the JP Morgan interest,
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:14.020]   the shipbuilding powder interest, had all gotten together and bought the top, they placed
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.500]   editors at the top 25 newspapers in order to control the content on political policy
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.700]   and military policy.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.900]   So that was really the declaration, the first origins of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:30.840]   which goal is to kind of control and mold the minds of the masses using official experts
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.020]   and historians and-
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.660]   So these clues won't leak.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:44.100]   How about Harry Truman's speech before the US Senate in 1942 denouncing the Rockefeller
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:51.460]   interest as traitors because they were selling oil to both sides.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:58.540]   What he didn't know was that the Krupp cannon makers were doing the same thing, making the
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.300]   German cannon, selling them to the French or anyone else who would buy them.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:11.140]   They had already become a virtual global society.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:17.340]   But Truman's denunciation of the Rockefellers on the floor of the Senate, you would think
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:25.460]   that would be just elementary sharing with generations of school kids.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:32.060]   No, it doesn't exist for all practical purposes, unless you're willing to sit in the, well,
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.540]   I generally sit in the library stacks and go through.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.100]   I did that in Columbia.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:47.580]   I said, "I'm going to find out," oh, no, I'm going back to 1958.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.580]   So I got a stack pass.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.620]   I've heard about stack pass.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.380]   I'm down like in the sixth level.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.980]   There's these huge stacks of popular magazines.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:05.900]   You know, I'm interested to find out what the popular newspapers and magazines said
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:13.820]   about the Second World War before it started, for like the 90 days before it started.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:21.540]   Let me tell you, to a publication, there not only was a certainty there was going to be
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:30.100]   war, but no worry at all, they all agreed that there was no ability on the part of any
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:36.660]   potential enemy to sustain a war, that all the gains would be right away, then they couldn't
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.300]   replace their losses.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:47.500]   I noted that Quigley said, "Not only did the British start the war with a larger air force
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:55.420]   than the Germans and more advanced technologically, but they could replace their losses and the
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.300]   Germans couldn't and the Japs couldn't at all.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.740]   So they ended the war with the same plane they began the war with."
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.660]   Well, this was understood before we had a war.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.500]   This is a good way to get out of the depression.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:17.620]   Good way to cow dissidents in the population always is to declare a national emergency.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:24.060]   Then you have an excuse for foreclosing freedom of speech.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.300]   What did Quigley do that was so unique or remarkable that no one else had done before?
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:36.020]   Well, what Carol Quigley, the head of the Foreign Service Department at Georgetown University,
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:47.300]   no marginal school, what he did was use his invitation to be the only human being ever
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:54.500]   invited to view the files of the Council on Foreign Relations, and I believe its predecessor
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.020]   also.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:02.860]   What he did was to actually write a major piece of nonfiction.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:13.460]   Must be 1,300 pages long, fairly small print, and he made the fatal mistake of being a superb
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:21.180]   writer and thinker so that it's accessible to anyone who gets a hold of a copy of the
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.540]   book.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:30.220]   That was quite impossible beginning six months after the book was published, and I can just
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.420]   see the manuscript must have been this big.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.740]   So an editor asked to vet the thing and make sure.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   And after all, Georgetown, this guy's safe.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   Out it goes.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.940]   Macmillan publishes it.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.900]   Sells out instantly.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.100]   Instantly.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:33:00.940]   And any conspiracy theory you've ever heard of is documented, not as a conspiracy theory.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.860]   Gives you the name, the date, the time, the actual letters.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.300]   Good God.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.620]   Well somebody got hung for that.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:18.580]   Macmillan broke the plates, told Quigley there was no interest in the book at all.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.500]   Broke the plate so it couldn't be reprinted.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:28.900]   Quigley's on a tape recording right at the end of his life that's stored down in Georgetown
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:36.580]   in the stacks saying that they lied to him, that they had tons of who wouldn't want to
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.540]   read the book.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:47.700]   I spent six months looking for a copy of the book and finally found one in the rare book
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:55.620]   room at New York University and had it stolen.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:01.500]   And then a couple of months later, because I'd looked in so many cities, I got a call,
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:09.460]   mysterious call from a fellow, I think turned out to be a dentist, had a radio show.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460]   I know who he is.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.460]   Okay.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460]   It's Stan Monti.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.460]   Yeah, Stan Monti.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.740]   He said, "I understand you're looking for a..."
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.140]   "Well," I said, "do you know where..."
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.460]   "Yes," he said, "I have some copies."
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.980]   Of course he had reprinted the copies.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:39.100]   And after Monti, over the next couple of years, several other people had taken the Macmillan
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:50.140]   and reprinted it so much in fact that it became the basis for a growing number of aware people.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:59.620]   They weren't sure what they were aware of other than that the story was not as delivered,
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.140]   not in junior high and not at Harvard.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.540]   It was a different story.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:11.500]   It was a story that could accommodate two fraternity brothers at Yale running against
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.980]   one another for president.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.260]   The big agenda.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:26.580]   But Quigley's real gift to the rest of us is his absolute mastery of prose and his really
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:33.420]   interesting mind and his confession that he agreed with the plot.
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:39.940]   He simply, as a good Roman Catholic, didn't apply it with the secrecy.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:46.420]   He said, "I believe there's nothing anyone can do about this anyway."
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.700]   It was marvelous.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.740]   I go back whenever I feel despair.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.740]   And not an easy...
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:58.900]   I mean, it's an easy read because it's so well written, but it's a big chunk.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:07.540]   He says, for example, that the only times liberty's ever appeared in human society is
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:14.660]   when the population is privately armed with deadly weapons.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:21.620]   And to reach the acme of liberty, they have to have the same weapons available to them
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.900]   that the government has available to them.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.940]   And yet we're not talking about some guy who rolls his collar up.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:35.380]   We're talking about this internationally famous scholar.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:41.700]   Well, at the beginning of the American Revolution, the people who were fighting against the British
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.460]   government had equal arms.
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.460]   They were landowners.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.700]   They had an interest to fight over it.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   That stopped being equal in the 1930s with mechanized warfare and mass production because
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.500]   they've had Prussian education in place for 80 years, and now everyone's an obedient worker.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.420]   And Omsk Spraka allows a lot of people to do things that they normally wouldn't do,
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.740]   but now it's part of their job, and now it's their responsibility, and now it's their duty.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.140]   And all the things that Milgram drove home through his experiments.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.100]   Look, these people will kill other people if you put a white coat on.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.740]   Yes.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.260]   Yes.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.500]   Well, it's quite exciting.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:23.140]   It's a hideous turn in human history, but it's quite exciting.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:33.660]   The comprehensive surveillance mechanism prevents local groups from developing armament.
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:44.460]   These Arabs have done the only thing of which there isn't a successful defense, and that's
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:52.780]   to blow, just what the Japs did at the end of World War II, to blow themselves up, to
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:38:00.700]   blow babies up, to blow, not women very often, but still they're beginning to appear as human
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.500]   weapons.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:09.660]   What you can do is suppress that activity, but you can't do it and say, "This is a free
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.700]   society and we're all in the game together."
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.460]   There are four copies, I think, of Tragedy and Hope around.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.900]   Have you seen the first edition?
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:28.340]   I have, and I'm wondering when Macmillan has been forced to reprint it, very recently,
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:35.220]   the last year or two, and I'm wondering, you only have to delete key sections, still be
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:40.980]   a big book, to take the real sting out of it.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:47.460]   I thought somebody with young eyes and a lot of stamina ought to sit with the original
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.020]   edition and the reprint just to make sure.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.060]   So we're doing it tomorrow afternoon.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.980]   We have a first edition and we have several other reprints and we're going to...
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:05.420]   So do let me know, because I have other people I'm trying to see the idea and I could say
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:10.380]   there's projects underway and why don't you send them a little check.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.380]   Absolutely.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.740]   What do you think about Quigley's book, Anglo-American Establishment?
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:23.660]   You know, I was, again, I was impressed by the thinking and the scholarship, but I think
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:32.820]   the presentation puts it beyond the reach, not beyond the understanding, but beyond the
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:38.500]   reach of ordinary people without a coach.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:47.380]   And I do think we have a pressing need to find, without diluting the complexity, to
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.380]   find the idiom.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:56.540]   I think I said to Rich earlier, it drives me insane.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:04.340]   Things I've been rewriting for years because I'll try them out and I'll feel that an audience
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.220]   misses how that plugs in.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:16.200]   It's almost as if the audience needs a little bit of, you know, re-inspiring their curiosity,
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.940]   but then giving them a methodology by which they can start to reignite their learning.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.260]   And then once they bring their attention and consciousness up a little bit, then they can
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.460]   receive some of these other messages.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:30.860]   In the meantime, we can be coaches and help them kind of get that.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:40.060]   We mentioned this earlier, but the great favor Charles Darwin did for people like me is to
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:47.100]   indict the Irish as hopeless biology because my audience is a full Irish and I say, don't
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.620]   trust an old broken down school teacher.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:41:01.860]   Pick the book up and go to the Irish sections because it's unmistakable his scorn and contempt
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.380]   to dismiss them as irredeemable.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.940]   The Spanish is irredeemable.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:15.340]   It's quite a little catalog of people, not Swedish blondes, mind you.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:21.500]   No, Darwin does that because instead of observing how things actually work, they were trying
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.940]   to carry out an agenda.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.620]   So he creates these ideas and he said under these ideas, you people can do what you want
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.060]   and it's going to make them hopeless.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.180]   And if you think you're hopeless, then you're not really aspiring to climb up any ladder
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.900]   because there's no ladder because you've been told you're hopeless.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.980]   And he gets them to basically self-amputate their curiosity and then they bring in compulsory
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:45.380]   schooling and that cauterizes the whole thing and they're like, you won't be curious anymore.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:54.020]   I think Darwin himself had a lot of, and he's not innocent, but he had a lot of innocence
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.420]   in his character.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.780]   Galton has none.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.780]   None.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:07.980]   Galton knows exactly where to drop these things to cause maximum damage and to institutionalize
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.420]   the anti-educational nature of school.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.500]   Once it's institutionalized, nobody has to know what's going on.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.140]   That's the way you make your living.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:29.900]   If you were, for example, to extend the privileges of partial autonomy among school kids, you
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:40.100]   would shrink the establishment and that is no way to retain power or income.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:50.380]   If you were to find substitutions for the purchased supposed improvements in curriculum,
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:58.860]   I mean the truth is superb education doesn't cost a penny to deliver.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:05.020]   If you understand what it is, what you're aiming for, and what you can use, it's a lot
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:13.240]   easier if you have money, but what money's usually used for is to purchase layer after
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:23.780]   layer of interventions and those interventions prevent the educational result.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:29.620]   Compare and contrast how Adam Smith felt about money and the earning of it to sustain oneself
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:38.380]   versus today where it's just earned to buy more and compulsory status symbols, conspicuous
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   consumption.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:47.540]   I must tell you, I used to be enough of a favorite at the Cato Institute that I was
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:52.620]   named the Secretary of Education in their shadow cabinet.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.820]   That has to be, oh, that's when, did you know Marshall Fritz?
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.500]   No, I don't know Marshall Fritz.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:05.340]   He was a legendary member.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:13.220]   When I discovered what Adam Smith actually said, which I wouldn't deny the key people
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:25.540]   at Cato also know, I became very, very problematical because in theory of moral sentiments, Smith,
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.420]   I'm going to give a shorthand here.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:35.660]   Smith says that to spend your time making money as a mark of insanity and what it'll
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:43.620]   buy you is a bad life, but we should be grateful to the people who do that because they assemble
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:53.180]   capital, they pay the biggest price and they create improvements for everybody else.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:45:05.540]   I don't think the religion of libertarian capitalism wishes that complication to be
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.620]   well understood because there's no way to explain it away.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:14.740]   Just as he's very clear that the peasant son and the Duke son are the same people, he's
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.360]   very, very clear.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:22.820]   You got to be nuts to assemble capital.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.500]   What lessons can we learn from Ben Franklin?
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.420]   Franklin's life is the best lesson.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:40.140]   Franklin was such, I almost slipped into Pittsburgh profanity, but I won't.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:46.820]   Franklin was not a morally nice human being in any way.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:55.540]   In fact, his son broke off contact with him and never spoke to him again for 40 years
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.260]   for the rest of their life.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.260]   So Franklin was the ultimate pragmatist.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:07.820]   He masqueraded as a Quaker even though he had no ties whatsoever.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:14.460]   The French who financed the revolution talked about this marvelous Quaker.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:21.740]   I mean, he was like a national sensation over there and he didn't disguise in his dress.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:26.220]   I mean, he camouflaged himself.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:33.180]   He always walked a line where he could justify what he was doing.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:43.140]   But his life is evidence from a huge, probably a lower middle class family, a candle maker.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:49.500]   They always had food on the table, but his autobiography is worth its weight in gold
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   many times because he explains how you can introduce the highest level curriculum imaginable
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.900]   to 10, 11 year old people.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:13.100]   That his father, who had no touch with scholastic theory, would bring in every night a strange,
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:23.140]   stranger from the street, set an extra place at table so that the in-house culture could
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:29.660]   be infused with fresh input there.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:40.180]   That he and his friends decided that without mastering high level written prose, there
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:46.620]   are opportunities, I mean, he's 11 years old and they say, "How are we going to get a big
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:53.860]   time literary style when nobody?"
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:48:02.100]   They take the New Yorker magazine of the day, the Tatler and the Spectator, written, read
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:10.860]   by only the most hoity-toity, and they rewrote the articles in their own words and then would
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.940]   present the rewrite to strangers and say, "Pardon me, sir.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:21.620]   Could you tell me where this article might have come from?"
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:28.700]   And when everyone said, "Oh, that's Tatler or Spectator," they knew they had mastered
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.700]   that.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.820]   Come on, they wouldn't do that at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:45.340]   These are 11, 12 year old boys and he's doing it while he's working a 60 hour week at labor
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:54.020]   and he's putting capital aside for his own business by selling beer to the printers at
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.660]   their lunch hour.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.820]   How does he get to do that?
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:03.180]   He goes to the owner of the print shop and he says, "Look, you're letting these guys
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.180]   go for lunch.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:11.580]   Some of them are coming back woozy, some of them are not coming back at all.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:20.020]   Let me bring the buckets of beer in, make a penny, and they'll be chained to the machine."
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.980]   That's Ben Franklin, mind you.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:29.900]   So his accomplishments, I mean, he's the reason we have a post office.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:34.180]   He's the reason there's a University of Pennsylvania.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   He's probably the reason the German isn't a co-evil in Pennsylvania because all these
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:54.580]   little German pottish groups were not speaking English any more than they could get by with
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:03.940]   and he found ways to put political pressure and penalties on them if their kids weren't
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.460]   surrendered to English training.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:18.940]   Now he's a miraculous example of what nobody can do if they know what to do and have some
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.140]   discipline, mind you.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:30.540]   I would say nobody should not read Franklin's autobiography very, very slowly.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:38.500]   Do not read it for the story but for the details and you have a formula that anybody could
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.340]   use.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.900]   So there's for Ben Franklin.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:50.780]   What could a student learn from the life experiences, young life experiences of Thomas Edison?
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:51:02.820]   Well, Mr. Edison from New Jersey begged his mother not to waste his time sending him to
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.820]   school.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:11.540]   That's before he was 12 years old and to allow him to go west during the Civil War
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:20.740]   where opportunity was burgeoning and she let him do it a thousand miles from home.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.380]   He became a train boy.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.140]   That's the lowest job imaginable.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:35.300]   You know, at whistle stops you go out and buy sodas or coffee.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.860]   You know, you're everybody's factotum.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:46.620]   But he talked the train into letting him put a broken down printing press in the boxcar
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:53.660]   and then during the Civil War, because he was able to connect things into new realities,
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:52:03.380]   he knew that the train stations got Civil War news at the same time the newspapers did.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.340]   But the newspapers didn't come out to certain hours.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:12.300]   He used his printing press to run current Civil War news.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:21.980]   Instead of auctioning off children at the whistle stops, he sold the Grand Trunk Herald.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:27.220]   And because he wasn't the nicest guy in the world, he varied the price from a nickel to
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.300]   a quarter depending on what the audience could pay.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:39.860]   He put together a substantial stake that founded his own.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:49.900]   Plus, he used the stake in the years he was doing this to start three businesses, each
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:53:01.060]   one of which depended on the advantage he had by going up and down the Michigan length
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.060]   there.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:13.700]   Now let me see, I'm years away from, one of them, one of them was that he could distribute
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.180]   magazines and newspapers free.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:23.380]   He'd just pick them up at some drop point and he could put anyone out of business because
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:28.100]   he didn't really have to charge much to do that.
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:34.220]   There were a couple of other, I think one was a food business so that when he ran out
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:38.660]   to get something for the passengers, he was the owner of the business.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.380]   And there was a third one.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:46.860]   He of course has 1,007 patents.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:52.620]   Without a day in college, in fact, when he founded GE, it wasn't called GE, that's what
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:54:01.980]   it became, he made the test for hiring executive staff so hard that he used to laugh and say
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.980]   nobody with a college degree can pass this test.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:15.980]   Now notice if all of this documented history was, and it's your birthright, if this were
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:21.380]   shared with you in third grade and fourth grade and fifth grade, notice that you would
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:29.500]   arrive at the age of 12 with a whole different idea of what your prospects were rather than
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:35.580]   your hands shaking because you got a C on your report card and that probably would doom
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.580]   your career.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:49.220]   I mean, it's a colossal crime and I'm speaking now as a detective story fan.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:55:00.940]   I'm staying away from the moral high ground here because it's so far beyond what we define
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.500]   as good and evil.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:14.100]   And for the people who do this, it is good because as Darwin's Malthus, as Thomas Malthus
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:22.980]   says clearly in his essay, climbing the mountain, the high ground, the moral mountain, he says
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.620]   it's a kindness.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:33.220]   These people are doomed to such miserable lives that to hasten their demise is a great
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.420]   kindness to them.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.460]   You work them to death, you starve them.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.540]   You're doing God's work.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:52.140]   He of course was a parson of the Church of England, which Charles was trained to be,
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:57.460]   but left in Galton.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:03.500]   We had people like Lippman and Bernays who recognized that people were inherently irrational.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:08.060]   And instead of trying to teach them critical thinking, they say, let's use fear and confusion
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.740]   to control them even more.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:21.620]   And Spinoza as the author of that, get a hold of there around a translation of Tractatus
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.580]   Religio Politicus published in 1690.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:33.140]   And any outlook you have on Spinoza will change radically.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:40.540]   You're in the hands of a man who could put Adolf Hitler and his high command in the shade.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.300]   He had worked out all the ways.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.420]   There weren't any escape loopholes.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:57.580]   And he sold the plan to monarchs, you know, who had a long, hard slug to sell it to, you
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:07.020]   know, the traditional upper classes who still had scraps of morality, traditional morality.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.460]   They still hadn't become justified sinners.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:21.300]   Thomas Jefferson in Notes on the State of Virginia.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:29.580]   He's trying to assemble, because Spinoza's ideas are already in America, he's trying
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:39.380]   to assemble the possible good use that could come out of an institution of schooling.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:47.140]   That's why shallow teacher college texts say that Jefferson was one of the pioneers.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:57.540]   But what Jefferson said was that unless five things are done, it will be a mere secular
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.540]   religion.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:08.940]   And as soon as I saw that Spinoza's direct positive program to get rid of emotional religion,
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.540]   that's a wild card.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.780]   Secular religion's okay.
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.340]   And that's what the Church of England did.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.980]   Wasn't inspired.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:23.540]   Men sat around in committees and figured out what God would want.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:29.260]   We have one minute left on this tape for today.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.660]   My question would be in the last minute, who was Niccolo Machiavelli and why should every
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.340]   school child take a gander at what?
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.980]   You've got to take a gander at Machiavelli.
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:50.740]   Machiavelli was a Florentine at a time when Italy wasn't a unified nation.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:55.700]   It was a collection of powerful city-states, or at least some were.
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:59:02.620]   And Florence was one of the most powerful, but it had important rivals.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:10.580]   And Machiavelli, he was a middle-level politician, call him.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.540]   And he was ambitious.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.180]   So he wanted to, it was the famous Borgia.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.780]   Cesare Borgia and Medici.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:30.340]   He wanted to do what Henry Kissinger did, is to establish himself as a fountain of utility
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.420]   for the Borgias.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.260]   And he really had an excellent mind.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.500]   And it's hard to tell what his character was because he has other books that are rather
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.260]   morally grounded.
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:53.260]   But for the first time in history, the secrets that have been talked about in drawing rooms,
[00:59:53.260 --> 01:00:03.900]   maybe leaked a little bit like Hobbes' Leviathan there, suddenly it was an unbroken presentation
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:12.060]   of how the prince should maintain and enlarge his power there.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:16.500]   It electrified the planet.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:23.540]   First of all, the people who already knew these things were ticked.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:30.500]   And the people who suspected them were put in a moral quandary of buying.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.900]   Now it would be a deliberate choice.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:43.660]   But for the great unwashed and for the religious power that represented them, here was, and
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.580]   his name was after all, Nick.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:55.060]   There was old Nick.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:04.060]   We could give us ten years and no one could pass through school without being aware of
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:11.740]   these high or low points in the creation of their own society.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:17.780]   Then at least they would have choices.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.620]   And I know some would choose to sell on.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:28.460]   But others, because of that romantic quality in the young, that's why we send them over
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:35.660]   to get blown up, would they do what they did in the 60s?
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:40.340]   It's a turning point in American history.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.980]   After national policy...
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:51.940]   I'll just mark where we are.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.580]   Remind me tomorrow, I'll do this.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:03.740]   After national policy was contradicted by the riffraff in colleges and high schools,
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:09.500]   word went out that was never to happen again.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:18.220]   A group called the Trilateral Commission published a book, they subsidized it, NYU, it's worth
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:24.940]   picking up, it's called The Crisis of Democracy, 1975.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:33.060]   And in shorthand, the crisis is, if the people take it seriously, we've got trouble on our
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.660]   hands.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:42.460]   So we've got to hide power and how decisions are made even more rigorously than they've
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.460]   done in the past.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:50.140]   Just like Hobbes said, power is never where it seems to be.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.020]   It's never there.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.260]   Those are always the, you know, the black catch.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.500]   If only Hobbes was writing for the average person, if only the person was literate, if
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:06.860]   only they had critical thinking so that their literacy didn't make them a slave.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:09.700]   Yeah, it makes you think of people like Hobbes.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.420]   Oh, it's just another book.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   It's a man's book.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   That's his opinion.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:24.340]   Well, he was the advisor to the king, and the book stayed in print, you know, for 450
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.100]   years.
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.700]   It's actually in the great books.
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.700]   It's in with Machiavelli.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.700]   Machiavelli and Hobbes, volume 23.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.700]   From that set over there.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.700]   It's the great books of the Western world.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.700]   It's written by Chicago.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:49.300]   I was accepted to the University of Chicago when I was in sophomore in high school.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:04:13.700]   My mother wouldn't let me go, and my uncle graduated from there.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.820]   It's all good for right now.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:16.820]   Some won't be up there.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:17.820]   I just wanted to make sure.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.820]   [slap]
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.820]   That was loud and clear.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.820]   All right.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.580]   First, I would like to present you with a book.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:31.940]   Not that you don't have enough books, but this particular book was written by a friend
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.980]   of Thomas Beckett, and he wrote it for Thomas Beckett.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:40.940]   For Thomas Beckett didn't have, in this author's opinion, enough intellectual self-defense
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.900]   to do what he was doing, and he was trying to help him out.
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.380]   His name is John of Salisbury, and it was written in the 12th century.
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:53.660]   I thought, if there was such a thing as reincarnation, this guy reminds me of you, and that you would
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.460]   greatly enjoy this book.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.700]   I will read it with pleasure.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:04.900]   12th century defense of logic and reason in a time of irrationality.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:10.580]   I took the liberty of, just in the prologue, I marked a couple pages there that has some,
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.820]   there's a couple quotes in there where he basically lays out why he's doing it.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.940]   I thought, I got a chuckle out of it, and I thought you could always use a good laugh
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.940]   now and then.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:24.940]   This will be the very next thing I read.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.020]   All right.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:31.420]   Now I have one last bit of housekeeping.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:36.340]   Let me see.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.820]   If you could read that to the camera while, at the same time, holding this mug, and it'll
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:46.540]   be the intro for the episode.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:49.020]   Or you can change it however you like.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.020]   Give me the high sign.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:58.060]   Hi, I'm John Taylor Gatto, and this is What You've Been Missing.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.580]   Awesome.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.820]   Yesterday the name of R. Gordon Watson came up, and you raised your eyebrows.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.620]   What does that name mean to you?
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:16.660]   Well, it means to me, Soma, the magic mushroom, and that Watson wasn't some fringe nut, but
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:23.020]   some Wall Street heavy hitter.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:29.580]   I read it with great pleasure, not once, but until it fell apart.
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.620]   Before you leave today, I have a DVD for you.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.620]   I just have to burn it.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.540]   I have the folder made and everything, and in there I put Watson's Russia, Mushrooms,
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.020]   and History book, which is very hard to find on PDF.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.220]   I just thought you'd get a kick out of it.
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:43.100]   I will get a big kick out of it.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.700]   What does the name Antony Sutton mean to you?
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:52.540]   Actually, I corresponded briefly with Sutton.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:07:03.300]   He made the contact after he read Underground History, and his books about the rise of Wall
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:10.180]   Street and the rise of the Soviet Union and Wall Street and the rise of Nazism were important
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:17.820]   parts in a slow process of overcoming my own skepticism.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.300]   I mean, I had all the pieces.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:28.060]   I had many of the pieces, rather, but they seemed to add up to a reality that I could
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:34.100]   find no hint of recognition of.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:43.780]   In the copious reading I had done and kept current, why weren't there any references
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   to this at all?
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:55.620]   For occasionally when someone like Ramsey Clark would seem to breach the wall of security,
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.940]   Ramsey was toast.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.580]   He was marginalized.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.740]   No one ever mentioned Ramsey again.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.060]   He wasn't a guest on any show.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:10.060]   Well, the same thing happened to Sutton because he worked for the Hoover Institute at Stanford
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:13.860]   University, which is very prestigious, and then once they started reading his work, they're
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.380]   like, "You can't write this."
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.180]   He said, "That's the ticket out of here.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.300]   I must go find out what's going on."
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.500]   I think he wrote nine or more books on these various subjects.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.540]   When you see how Wall Street funded the Bolsheviks and Wall Street was funding the Nazis and
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:32.260]   the Bushes and the Harrimans and all those families that were also eugenicists and the
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:35.260]   ones that want to do compulsory schooling and tell you what to do with your kids and
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.620]   all these other things, there's a very small-knit group.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:42.460]   Once you try to understand the philosophy of what makes them the utopians that are trying
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:48.500]   to shape everyone else's lives and violate their volition, I thought it was like that's
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:53.180]   overwhelming to discover that, but then you discover someone like Lysander Spooner or
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:57.540]   Bastiat, Frederick Bastiat, and read the book The Law, and it's so simple, and yet if you
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.660]   don't understand the simplicity, it's easy for these other groups to take it away from
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.660]   us.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:02.660]   Yes.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:08.300]   Very easy to marginalize as, "Oh, it's time for this nonsense."
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:18.540]   I mentioned in our session yesterday that as I was poking around for other reasons in
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:26.180]   the history of American adoption, I kept running into the people who were the architects of
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:34.500]   American schooling, and I said, "What possible correspondence?"
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:41.260]   The chapter in underground history, Daughters of the Barons of Runnymede, is actually a
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:51.620]   kind of lens into my brain trying to prove to myself there was some sense in following
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.100]   this road.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:04.540]   If the heirs of the people who fought at Runnymede had maintained an 850-year continuity, and
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:11.700]   then I found other organizations that had, I said, "It's possible that someone with an
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:17.060]   agenda other than this."
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.380]   So who was Ignatius Loyola?
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:34.620]   Well, Loyola was the founder of the Army of Jesus, the Jesuits who penetrated the Reformation
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:41.340]   and eventually produced the phenomenon in the history records as the Counter-Reformation.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:49.500]   They slowed the momentum down because the Reformation really is founded, although Calvin
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.940]   is the eminence Gris.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:11:04.020]   Luther's "Every man his own priest" is this wild declaration of radicalism.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:11.300]   To get rid of the religious priesthood is to get rid of all middlemen, yes.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:16.020]   There were many countries that outlawed the Jesuits in the late 1700s, and one of those
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.580]   was the province or electorate of Bavaria.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:25.020]   And then there was a Jesuit professor of canon law named Adam Beischaupt who created a group.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:30.460]   What influence specifically has that group had on the education system?
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:39.740]   Well, to pursue that line would require so many illusions.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:50.500]   I prefer not to enter an area where I can't field the hardest questions with substantive
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:12:00.020]   facts, but certainly the sense of powers behind the scenes is very, very strong.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:05.540]   Let me give you a few specifics.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:15.340]   It's been clear since the beginning of standardized testing that the tests do not predict, and
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:24.060]   the best American, the most prestigious American universities have either dismissed it or kept
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.740]   it in pro forma place.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:34.580]   But actually, as Harvard and Princeton told me, it's not a significant determinant.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:42.020]   They just don't want to rock the boat, the glue that holds this pyramid together.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:51.660]   They don't predict then why is 10% of the school year and school budget devoted to exerting
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:59.740]   stress on so many millions of people and through the children, their families, and why does
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:08.020]   so many innocently ignorant school teachers say this will determine your future when it
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:14.580]   only does if you convince yourself that it determines your future?
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:22.660]   It has no predictive power at all other than to signal this is someone who will memorize
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:26.020]   whatever you ask him to memorize.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:29.740]   This is a useful skill, an anti-skill.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.020]   In the book, the Leipzig Connection, Basics in Education, toward the end of the book after
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:39.140]   talking about Pestalozzi, it talks about Pestalozzi's mentor, who was Johann Caspar Lavater, who
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:45.260]   was working and experimenting on Swiss lower privileged children in a universal schooling
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:46.260]   system.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.940]   He was also a grandmaster of the Illuminati.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:52.580]   So since Pestalozzi and Lavater and all these other key figures that were in the Prussian
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.420]   education system were also members of the Prussian Illuminati, it just seemed natural
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:04.260]   to see the takeover and undermining of nationhood of our society, the taking away of our identity
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:09.020]   through the school system is also making we as a nation incoherent.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:14.020]   It just seems like there is a very militaristic strategy that's been in place a long time.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:18.180]   Notice what the specific mechanism is.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:25.580]   It's an artificial extension of childhood, theoretically to the grave, but certainly
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:31.180]   beyond the point where learning anything is easy.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:38.500]   As long as you indulge childish fears and childish appetites long enough, you've effectively
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:44.020]   rendered somebody harmless.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:52.020]   You can see it in its crudest form in the military, in the training of recruits, or
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.980]   in fraternities in the hazing of freshmen.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:06.700]   But actually, yesterday I hope we talked about Richard Branson and the turning point of his
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:13.900]   life at age four when his mother drops him miles from home.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:22.060]   But most of human history anywhere on the planet, childhood is over by the age of seven.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:31.580]   And even in the most permissive cultures, it's over by the age of 11 or 12.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:40.260]   People are, even in our own country at the beginning of the 20th century, a substantial
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:46.900]   number of young women at the age of 13 were married or becoming married.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:58.060]   I'm thinking in particular of, I'm thinking of an 18 volume History of the World that
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:06.300]   used to be for 20 years the premium of Book of the Month Club, written by a husband and
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.860]   wife team.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:16.500]   And still a rather respectable history in an inside historian say, "It's not bad history.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.500]   It's very, very."
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.220]   >> They also do a history of philosophy set?
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.220]   >> Yes.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.220]   >> I have it.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.540]   Gino Denning just sent it to me last week.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.540]   I just scanned in.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:28.180]   It's on my desk if you want to go get it.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:33.100]   All we need is the last name and it'll trigger.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:42.820]   In any case, the fellow who had been trained, I think at UChicago as a historian, marries
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:47.020]   his wife who becomes his co-writer and-- >> Will Durant.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.740]   >> Will Durant and Ariel.
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:55.780]   Ariel was either 13 or 15.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:01.740]   There's a dispute on the internet about how she wasn't older than 15.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.740]   And I suspect she was 13 when they married.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.580]   Was Will some form of sexual oppressor?
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.580]   No.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:18.220]   Instead of going to junior high school, Ariel studied professional historiography and its
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.180]   protocols.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.820]   And she was a full partner in the writing.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.740]   And Will died, pre-deceased her 10 years.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:36.300]   And she continued to lecture, having begun her productive life when people began their
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.260]   productive lives.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:47.540]   To extend this to the late teens or beyond the late teens is to fly in the face of the
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:53.500]   first admiral in American history being in charge of a warship.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.500]   >> Farragut.
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.220]   >> Farragut at the age of 12.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:07.180]   Or George Washington being the surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia in his mid-teens.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.900]   >> Very entrepreneurial attitudes that they have.
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:17.260]   >> Or Jefferson running a plantation, his parents both dead, 250 employees.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:19.300]   He's 12 or 13.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:23.580]   But these examples go on and on and on.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:32.940]   Why have we marginalized the young who, whatever they lack in experience, more than make up
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:40.220]   for in resilience, in acuity, they bring new eyes to old situations, which is the secret
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.580]   of scientific invention.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.580]   So it's done because they're the most dangerous.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:54.020]   They're the least overlaid with these conditioning.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:58.220]   And of course, that must have been understood way, way back in history.
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.020]   Alexander the Great, after all.
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.060]   >> You're noticing, you're observing that values have changed since the time of our
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:08.180]   founding fathers who were literate, autonomous, entrepreneurial.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.420]   They also grew hemp.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:10.900]   They knew the value of hemp.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.540]   >> How about George?
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:18.500]   He did it for medicinal purposes, so I assume it wasn't.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:22.620]   >> And Jefferson traveled the planet collecting different strains, and they had contests,
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:26.740]   and they wrote letters about their, "Hey, I've grown this strain, and it does this."
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:27.900]   And they're competing.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.660]   And so the fact that you're not taught about this in school, and the role that hemp played
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:36.700]   in making the sales and the clothing and everything was hemp dependent.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.460]   >> Or to miraculous fiber.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:47.900]   There are some rather sober accounts of the lengths to which the Hearst family went, because
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.700]   they were the largest forest owners in the country.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:55.060]   They supplied the wood pulp for newspapers.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:00.900]   But hemp newspapers are infinitely superior to wood pulp.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:10.140]   So they moved heaven and earth to create the narrative of re-ferment.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:15.260]   >> So if we're using wood pulp paper to make books these days, we're not only killing trees
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:21.620]   which eat CO2 and produce oxygen to make paper towels and toilet paper and all these other
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.860]   things beyond books.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.940]   But I noticed that a lot of the books that are printed recently, the pages are disintegrating.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:32.220]   And when you get old books from the 1800s, 1700s that are printed on hemp paper, they're
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.940]   still pretty existent.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:39.540]   We have a Johnson's Dictionary from 1848, and it's not printed on the same wood pulp
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.900]   acid paper that we have today.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:47.860]   So can you comment on ... They undermine education, but they're also undermining just our ability
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.300]   to get our hands on the books to educate ourselves, closing libraries and using types of paper
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.460]   that basically turn to dust.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.380]   >> Oh, yes.
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:08.260]   Since I've been in college in the '50s, there's been a prevailing wise guy ethic that you
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:15.780]   don't actually need to read these old books because there are plenty of abstracts, digests
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:22.380]   of these old books in existence, and that will give you the guts of the old book.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:27.460]   Well, let's take Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:33.060]   What the digests don't give you is the wealthiest, most powerful man in the world.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:40.300]   I mean, I don't know if that confluence has ever existed after Aurelius saying that nothing
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:46.540]   you can buy is worth having and nobody you can order around with your power is worth
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.580]   associating with.
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:52.740]   It's a rather acid ...
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.580]   >> So how old were you when you first met Marcus Aurelius?
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:22:07.020]   >> I was initially in translation in sixth grade in a coal mining town in western Pennsylvania
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:13.620]   where it was offered in translation, and of course, it's eminently readable.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:20.460]   And then in ninth grade, there was an option of reading it in Latin or doing something
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.820]   else.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:31.380]   So my mother insisted that I read it, Julius Caesar in Latin, "Gauleis omnis tuis in parte
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:36.740]   stres," at 75, or "Coram unum in colon belgio."
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:41.420]   I had to memorize the early part of it.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:49.780]   But Caesar's Gallic Wars isn't some old piece of fustian that, you know, if you're an elitist,
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.500]   you read to plug into the ancient world.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:23:01.100]   It establishes the principle that a weaker force can whip a larger force by dividing.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.620]   >> And being better prepared.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.620]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:08.060]   You can set the larger force against one another.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:17.820]   And you see that in schooling, the ordinary classes are set against one another by constant
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:28.100]   meaningless testing and small inconsequential prizes being given to the people who test
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:35.060]   best and wiggle their hands in the air so that the ordinary classes are divided for
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:41.180]   a period of 12 years through meaningless competition.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:48.620]   I noticed when I was in basic training in the Army and was told that I was going to
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:57.780]   learn in three hours how to take a rifle with 57 parts of blindfold and put it back together,
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.420]   I knew that I could not do that.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.940]   I knew I could not do that.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:13.060]   And yet in a room with 500 other scared young people, we all did it.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:21.100]   And they didn't say, and he finished first, you know, the important thing is what do we
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.780]   learn that's enhanced by competition?
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:30.020]   I mean, what real do we learn?
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:38.740]   It gets in the way because now your rank becomes a factor rather than the quality of what you've
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.740]   learned.
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:50.940]   I made these ideas clear to 13-year-olds at all times and found that after about 90 days,
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:59.740]   they became as addicted to ideas and the whys of things as I was.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.060]   Never a new idea would emerge in the classroom.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.860]   This is quite literally true.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.980]   I would grab a piece of chalk and write it on the wall.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.580]   I'd climb a ladder, write it on the ceiling.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:21.300]   Inside of that first 90 days, there were hundreds of digestive ideas everywhere.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:26.460]   On the floors when there was no room left.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:34.300]   On the backsides of the room, I had world maps and national maps and I could leap up
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:41.020]   and point to the origin of the idea as we know it or simultaneously they came.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:49.700]   As I say, it was roughly 90 days when classes that were considered the stupidest, people
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:58.020]   who'd never eaten off a tablecloth in their life were actually, they were hot to talk
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.300]   about ideas.
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.420]   We couldn't have that.
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:11.380]   How could we maintain the social order and the economic order if we had people who became
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:18.700]   fully alive when they were young and could get up when they're knocked down?
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:27.420]   I think a lot of the problem, it's very easy to assign this completely to sinister motives
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:30.940]   and there are certainly sinister motives at work.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:40.140]   But I think part of it is the problem of how we would manage a society that didn't require
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.140]   managing.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:46.340]   I don't think anyone's been able to solve that problem.
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:54.700]   The early America probably did it better than anyone we have easy access to.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.620]   I think it's not about anarchy.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.620]   Anarchy is just a void or a vacuum of government.
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:26:59.620]   It's about being autonomous.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.700]   If you take away the government, it doesn't automatically give people critical thinking
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:08.180]   or the self-reliance that they need and the compassionate communication that they need
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:12.420]   to work together with other people to achieve goals.
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:17.140]   Your explanation of how you learned the most powerful lesson of doing the impossible, you
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:21.220]   knew you couldn't do that and after an hour or so, you had just done something that you
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:22.300]   knew you couldn't do.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.740]   I knew I couldn't do it.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:28.080]   You took that experience and you taught younger people that they can do that because now they
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   have more years.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.740]   You had to be at least 18 to be in the army.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.540]   Now you're teaching 13-year-olds that the things that you know you can't do, you don't
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.540]   really know that.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.540]   Right.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:38.140]   You need to get that up here first.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.140]   Right.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:42.780]   The other question that I would follow up with is, in your third interview on Gnostic
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:47.580]   Media with Jan Ervin, I heard you mention these words, "trivium" and "quadrivium."
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:52.100]   I thought it maybe is something that was off your radar, but you spoke eloquently about
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.180]   it.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.740]   Where do you have familiarity with the trivium and quadrivium and what does it mean to you?
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:03.100]   I went to Jesuit boarding school in third grade.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:11.340]   So I'm between the ages of seven and a half and eight and a half years old.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:22.420]   The curriculum, reflecting back on it, which I first began to do 15, 20 years ago, the
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:32.420]   intellectual diet was not modified in any way for our tender years.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:45.940]   And the devices of discipline and motivation that would be used in an authoritarian world,
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.180]   they were not cherry of using.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:52.540]   But I do believe that their hearts were in the right place.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:29:01.340]   I remember being humiliated, I told you privately about this yesterday, by a Jesuit brother
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:09.820]   from St. Vincent's College, which is across the street from Xavier Academy where I went
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:17.260]   and was beaten on a daily basis by the Ursuline nuns, sometimes for mispronouncing French
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.060]   there.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:25.700]   But the brother was talking to us in the middle of the Second World War about the causes of
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.340]   the First World War.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   And he had written a list of causes on the board.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:36.740]   I had a magnificent memory before Drink intervened.
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:41.860]   And he said, "Could somebody face the back of the room now and tell us all the causes?"
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:48.580]   And I, with my memory, I did, word for word.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:57.220]   And he burst into a harsh kind of laughter and he said, "You fool, you believe me."
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:03.180]   He erased the board and said, "These are the causes of the war.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.300]   Now could you do it?"
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:10.940]   And now, chastened, I did, a lot less confidently.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:15.540]   And this time, the room exploded with his scorn.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.620]   He did it again.
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.620]   He erased the board.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:27.060]   He said, "You will never know the causes until you embed yourself into the primary documents
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:31.180]   and see how complicated a thing this is."
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:33.580]   That changed my life.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:38.460]   I only wish I might have had a second year there.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:43.380]   Before you can form your logical understanding, he said, you need to get in check with the
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.860]   knowledge, the actual grammar.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.860]   What are the artifacts?
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:46.860]   Where do these things document?
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.020]   And what's the primary sources?
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:57.660]   And this probably has occurred to other groups, but the intellectual part of the universal
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:06.460]   Christian religion, the Catholic Church, had a respect for scholarship.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:15.420]   And what happens as you collect data is that it forms itself into patterns.
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:22.340]   And if you record the patterns and test them to see that they hold true, eventually that
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.900]   suggests behaviors.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:35.660]   So they created a two-formula, a basic formula, which Dorothy shares.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:42.620]   And I'd urge all your listeners to read her essay, "The Lost Tools of Learning."
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:46.460]   She's a marvelous detective story writer.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:50.620]   And the detective stories really aren't genre stories.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:57.460]   They're a comedy of manners about the British upper classes.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:09.100]   But the trivium was becoming comfortable with a pattern of thinking in which you could dispel
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.140]   confusion.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:18.820]   And then the quadrivium was pushing it farther into specialized areas.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:32.140]   One of the huge mistakes that schooling makes, even homeschooling, is to organize the agenda
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:42.980]   and the goals in terms of subject learnings, English, math, social studies, science, because
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:51.660]   those categories, while better than chaos, are so crude they tend to mask what you're
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:54.380]   actually after.
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:59.780]   Take the universal study of the English language.
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:11.740]   What you're after is a mastery of the written language, the spoken language, and your own
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.780]   writing.
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:16.660]   So you've got these three divisions.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:23.820]   And now if you're after those things, your measurement's not through memory.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:30.980]   It's through performance, which is so much more accurate, as we spoke about a little
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:33.940]   earlier in this session.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:41.220]   The standardized tests aren't predictive, and every first-class university knows that.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:48.460]   You don't select people because they scored here on the SATs or whatever other tests are
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:56.900]   administered because they end up disappointing you, and you waste people who actually--
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:34:01.020]   In real life, we don't use standardized tests to make decisions, whereas you actually do
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:06.340]   use the trivium to observe, to process that information, and to make informed decisions.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.780]   Right.
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:16.700]   And while there are personal variants-- so I think the fundamental thing, as every philosopher
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:21.300]   in human history has said, is know yourself.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.620]   This is the fundament.
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:32.260]   Now you can take principles like trivium and quadrivium, and you can do a personal adaptation
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:37.100]   of the-- you know how they will work for you.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:45.180]   But the course I actually followed at the beginning was to say, I know this is not good
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:53.060]   for the kids I've been hired to teach, and where will I find an unerring structure?
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:35:00.180]   I said, obviously, it will be in the most expensive elite private boarding schools.
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:08.060]   So I made a 10-year study, although it paid off at the end of the first year, and I distilled
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:13.940]   the 12 secrets of the boarding school curriculum of power.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:20.900]   Now I'm talking about not private schools versus public schools at all, because most
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:26.180]   private schools follow the template that public schools laid down.
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:30.860]   I'm talking about the inner circle 20 or so.
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:34.220]   Let me just name a few of them.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:41.060]   I'm talking about Groton, where Franklin Delano Roosevelt emerged.
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:49.060]   I'm talking about St. Paul's, where the senator from Massachusetts who ran for president,
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:52.500]   the tall skinny guy John Kerry emerged.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:57.060]   I'm talking about Andover, where the Bush family went.
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:01.220]   I'm talking about Choate, where John F. Kennedy emerged.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:08.220]   I'm talking about one that not one person in 10,000 has ever heard of, Episcopal in
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:15.740]   Virginia, where John McCain, the populist, give me a break, emerged.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:22.660]   I learned about Episcopal from the sports section of a newspaper.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:30.020]   I'm looking for the next Pittsburgh Pirate to feed, and suddenly I see a tiny item that
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:37.780]   says it's the homecoming football game for Episcopal Prep School in Virginia.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.660]   25,000 alumni showed up.
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:43.900]   I said, "Boy, it's got to be a misprint."
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:47.220]   I mean, I can understand a thousand.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:54.740]   25,000 people came from all over the world for a high school alumni game.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:37:03.940]   So now I start to look and I discover that Episcopal, it's the naked revelation of the
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:11.180]   importance of religious tradition in upscale education.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:18.780]   Over half of the elite boarding schools in the country and all of the inner circle ones
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:27.780]   are grounded on religion, almost all on the Anglican religion, which isn't faith-based.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:36.220]   It was put together by committees arguing about what must have been in God's mind.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:40.540]   But also there's a respectable number that are Quaker-based.
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:48.460]   Now here we're talking about a tiny fraction of the population, no more than 100,000 people.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:53.540]   It's produced in the 20th century, two presidents.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.060]   How is that even possible?
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:59.740]   Statistically, what would a bookie say?
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:07.700]   The odds of this little splinter group who we all are taught are innocent and unworldly
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.540]   and pious.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:18.760]   So anyway, so I got the 12, I'd like to, if possible, go through a few of these because
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:28.580]   I adapted them instantly to Harlem kids and almost immediately began to produce results.
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:35.260]   It was roughly 90 days because at first Harlem kids don't believe that anything useful to
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:38.580]   them is going to happen at a school.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:47.060]   But after about 90 days, these kids start winning competitions with the inner circle
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:49.940]   kids of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:39:00.580]   Instead of being amazed and wondered about, I'm called in and accused of child abuse.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:03.660]   What on earth are these people doing?
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:08.340]   You must have written that for, I said, I will confess.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:12.340]   I corrected the spelling and the punctuation.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.820]   But that steel trap set of ideas proving the case is not mine.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:21.260]   I'm not up to that standard there.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.540]   So I began to get hot water ever since.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.820]   Let me share a few of these.
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:37.940]   We all are vaguely aware that literacy is at the heart of an intellectual inner life.
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:46.300]   But what we don't understand is that prior to the First World War, literacy commonly
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:56.860]   was divided into passive literacy, reading, and active literacy, speaking and writing.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:04.220]   And none of us are aware that in colonial days to teach active literacy to ordinary
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.420]   people was a crime.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.820]   Why?
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:14.100]   Because reading, you're locked in your own head and you still have the benefit of being
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.940]   able to read the boss's instructions about what to do.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:25.260]   But if you can speak well, as our current president can, or write well, you can reach
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:32.340]   way beyond your own skull and recruit allies.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.540]   That's a no-no for ordinary people.
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:41.820]   They're supposed to be so inarticulate, or their writing will look so funny with ink
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:46.140]   blots and things in it that no one treats them seriously.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:54.580]   So strong competencies in the active literacies are at the core of elite private boarding
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:41:03.900]   schools like Groton, St. Paul's, Choate, Lawrenceville, Gunnery, Hotchkiss.
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:11.780]   And each one of those schools, by the way, has some legendary tycoon as a patron, or
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.580]   sometimes more than one.
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:20.820]   Canton, Connecticut is J.P. Morgan's baby.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:24.300]   And this is in no particular order.
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:28.220]   It's in all institutional forms.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:36.220]   You're supposed to know the logic, the steps that we arrived at a prison system, or a library
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:42.780]   system, or all the other, the military system, obviously.
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:52.820]   Third, some of your listeners, watchers, viewers will be school teachers.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:42:02.380]   And if you teach history or literature, you will run into a great deal of difficulty moving
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:03.380]   kids.
[01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:09.940]   But if you approach those subjects and share this with the kids, that what we're after
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:17.420]   here is not a good story or memorizing details from Jane Austen for the test.
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:21.460]   We're after a theory of human nature.
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:31.380]   And anyone who's written a book that lasts more than their own time has spent years closely
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:35.260]   observing people in interaction.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:42.480]   And the trace left behind is an insight that you might spend a lifetime and never have.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:50.300]   So that's what we're after, a theory of human nature drawn from history or philosophy or
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:52.620]   literature or law.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:58.140]   Or the greatest trove that's unexamined is theology.
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:08.820]   I used to go to auctions and there'd be boxes of religious books, 50 cents or a dollar from
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:10.980]   a century ago.
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:13.980]   Nobody wanted them at auctions.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.900]   But I bought them because they were cheap.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.220]   And one day I have a barn in upstate New York.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:29.020]   I picked one up idly and I was in the hands of an intense thinker who was drawing on all
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:35.780]   history and philosophy to create an insight into human nature there.
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:43.860]   And I said, "Interesting that theology is something that we don't regard at all if we're
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:46.060]   ordinary people."
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:55.620]   So a few other of the secrets of the boarding school curriculum of power, mastery of the
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:58.940]   social forms.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:06.620]   And I would say it didn't take more than two days to take kids who had never eaten off
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:16.300]   a tablecloth and get them to see that the signs they give off when there's an egg glass
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:23.300]   spilled on the shirt or when they walk down the street listening to the radio or when
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:30.580]   they're too aggressive in approaching somebody shuts off opportunity.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:35.220]   They're like little badges that I don't want to speak to that person.
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:48.660]   And a lot of what we consider as racial or ethnic prejudice is simply that the disguise
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:55.940]   of these social forms is unknown to the person who then is discriminated against.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.540]   And I said, "Don't believe me."
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:08.860]   I said, "I'm going to instruct you in a superficial gloss of how to approach people and then the
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:16.100]   intellectual excuse we'll use is I'm sending you out of school for days to gather data
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.020]   for statistical processing.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:27.660]   We're going to test the local comparison with what the New York Times says the nation is
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:28.660]   thinking.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:35.260]   And I'll teach you the elementary statistics in one class session that you need."
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.940]   And it's a legitimate project.
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:43.580]   But meanwhile, you don't want to approach somebody and have them jump back or say, "If
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:46.180]   you don't get away from me, I'll call the police."
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:52.580]   And that's what you think will happen because of the overt racial prejudice on the liberal
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:54.460]   West Side of Manhattan.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:56.740]   But it won't happen, I guarantee.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:58.420]   Nor did it.
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:45:59.420]   Nor did it.
[01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:09.780]   The transition, I won't say it was 100%, but it surely was 80% simply from having a gloss
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.140]   on these social forms.
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:19.500]   And then this should tickle people watching this segment.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:29.060]   Then suddenly I saw that the rules of access to the great institutions of New York City
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:35.300]   by young people, which required, let's say at the sub-treasury building where the gold
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:40.500]   is kept down in Wall Street, one teacher for every five students.
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:47.900]   Well, a public school class of 30 students, you're not going to muster six teachers.
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:51.620]   And I said to the kids, "How do they know you're not a teacher?"
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:54.460]   "Well, we're only 13."
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.940]   Nobody knows that.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:59.740]   They know it because you're chewing gum with your mouth open.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.340]   They know it because you're scratching your head.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.540]   They know it because you slouch.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:06.940]   They know it because you giggle.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:11.540]   They know it because you carry a notebook that falls on the ground every few minutes
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:13.940]   and paper goes everywhere.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:22.540]   Why don't we master what a college student who could be a student teacher, what signs
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:23.820]   they would give off.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.700]   They'd carry a clipboard.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:29.620]   They'd cock it at an arrogant angle on their hip.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:37.140]   They would be slightly nasty in taking attendance every few minutes or saying, "When your mother
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.460]   hears about this, Jack."
[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:48.340]   I said, "Let's see if we can pick five people out of this class and penetrate security at
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:54.100]   the sub-treasury building, at the mayor's office, anywhere.
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.460]   We were never caught, not once.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:05.980]   Now, the Bronx Zoo says one for every 15 kids, but how are you going to even get two teachers
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.860]   to take kids to the Bronx Zoo there?"
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:17.500]   Well, it's easy if the kids can shift from being 13 to being arrogant college student
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.420]   teachers.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:23.780]   Never caught in eight years of doing this.
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:24.780]   Well, that's real self-esteem.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.860]   It gives them real confidence from experience.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:31.340]   To be able to go into Columbia, sit in the back of a class and see what college is like
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:34.220]   before you have to go to college takes away a lot of anxiety.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:37.060]   I don't know why you said that.
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.100]   Oh, okay.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:46.700]   We were only 20 blocks from Columbia, and I have a degree from Columbia, so I understood
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:53.020]   that the law school classes, there are 300 people in these banks of seats.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:58.660]   The only way, no one takes attendance there.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:05.620]   Your grades on the tests are evidence of whether you've been attending or not.
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:10.780]   But if you sit there slouch and pulling gum out of your mouth, yeah, someone will say,
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:12.820]   "Who are you?"
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:17.380]   Never caught once.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:25.900]   So our age, this artificial extension of childhood that we talked about at the beginning of this
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:35.700]   particular session, is a secret of crowd control where people become their own prisoners by
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:43.780]   adopting the cultural signs that they're immature or they're not of our group.
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:51.700]   And simply by seeing these things as languages, there isn't one English language, there are
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:56.140]   none that are modified according to the...
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:04.460]   Someone like Obama, how, I'm not sure, they understand this and they can shift effortlessly
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.140]   from one idiom to another.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:09.820]   And I would say that to the kids.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:15.660]   I would say, "Look, here's why you're reading English poetry."
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.980]   Now, there are a lot of reasons, but here's why we're doing it.
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:28.260]   You're going to find that the ordinary unit of meaning in the English language is three
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:37.020]   hard stresses long or sometimes four, but often it's two, three or four.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:43.620]   But as you enter the realm of intellect and you have more to say or more nuances to say,
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:48.060]   you need larger units of meaning.
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:51.740]   Five, that's iambic pentameter.
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:55.020]   Even six, that's hexameters.
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:58.860]   The Greeks use seven septameters.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:05.260]   And I want you to feel that and you'll feel it by reading and memorizing some of this
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:06.260]   poetry.
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:13.900]   You'll have the models built into your head to shift back and forth according to your
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.460]   audience there.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:22.900]   Shakespeare to the ignorant writes iambic pentameter lines.
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:28.540]   And one of the reasons you don't want to even look at Shakespeare is all the lines seem
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:32.060]   to be pretty much the same length.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:38.320]   But I'm going to teach you something that he knew four centuries ago.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:42.480]   It looks like they're all the same length.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:49.100]   But there's a breath pause in this speech after two heartbeats.
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:56.580]   The next breath pause is 12 before you've delivered your meaning, three, four.
[01:51:56.580 --> 01:52:04.440]   There's this inner jazz at work underneath this regular pattern.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:09.900]   You can learn to do that once someone exposes the secret to you.
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.380]   That's half the game.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:17.260]   And the other half of the game is simply building the models into yourself so you don't have
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.660]   to think, "Hmm, now here."
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:30.820]   And yet we use an exercise that if I tell you immediately turned horribly dull writers
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:37.940]   into at least modestly interesting writers, and it's totally mathematical, I said it'll
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:42.220]   take you a while to incorporate what I just said.
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:51.460]   So what I'm going to ask you to do is write one to 20 on 20 pieces of paper, put them
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:57.620]   in some sort of container and draw them out at random and then list what you've drawn
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.260]   out at random.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:06.620]   And I said, "Now you're going home, not for homework, but to learn this massive skill.
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:13.100]   And you're going to write a paper on X subject, and if one is the first number that came out,
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:18.140]   the first sentence will be one word long, one beat long.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:22.980]   If the second one is 20, it'll be 20 long."
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:23.980]   Immediately these horrible...
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:30.060]   Remember, I had to read 120 of these things at a time.
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:35.580]   And one of the reasons they were horrible is they were all... everyone had either a
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:40.060]   three or a four unit or a mixture in there.
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:48.420]   Now they had the kind of jams that readers aren't completely conscious of, but they record
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:54.300]   as something interesting about it, even when he's writing about a milk separator.
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:54:04.420]   And you as a filmmaker, remember Eisenstein's film of the peasants watching milk being separated
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:08.060]   on a Russian farm in the 1920s.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:12.940]   Why is it so awfully interesting?
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:19.340]   Because he understood things that the eye is looking at the movement of light around
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:20.660]   the screen.
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.860]   It's looking at entrances and exits.
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:31.740]   Thirteen-year-old kids from Harlem can master these secrets just as well as 25-year-old
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:33.940]   Harvard students can.
[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:37.060]   And then they become preternaturally sophisticated.
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:40.380]   What on earth?
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:43.420]   How do you know these things?
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:45.260]   Because they're our birthright.
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:54.500]   We're biologically equipped to learn this way unless somebody sticks their oar in and
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:01.900]   intervenes and says, "Read Jack London and memorize."
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:11.700]   That's the school system.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.700]   We've all heard about the hardwood.
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:13.700]   What's going on with this girl?
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.580]   >> Okay, I just need you to, for a minute, if you could just reframe this camera because
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:18.580]   I think something happened.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:19.580]   >> No, when I came in, the camera was moved.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.580]   I guess someone was monitoring on it or something.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:26.380]   >> Either way, I just want you to make sure that you focus.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:33.340]   >> I think, and I won't be as windy and the rest, but I think that everyone will profit.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:38.740]   And you'll see some evidences of the trivium at work here.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:44.820]   These are the 12 secrets of the elite boarding school curriculum of power.
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:45.820]   Are we on yet?
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:46.820]   >> Just one second.
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:47.820]   We'll be back on.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:52.460]   >> Because the next one- >> That's what people don't learn in public
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:55.020]   school, specifically what is different.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:58.780]   They're doing this and this is about their success in life and managing the other people
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:55:59.780]   who don't know it.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:00.780]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:01.780]   >> Right.
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:09.980]   >> So the next one will be an absolute eye-opener that took me about five years to tease out
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:17.980]   of the admissions procedures at Sarah Lawrence or the other inner circle colleges.
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:22.380]   >> You guys might as well do a tape change now.
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:23.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:24.380]   >> No, mine's out.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.380]   >> I'll turn these lights off.
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:35.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:47.380]   >> The 70, I have to do manually anyway.
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.380]   >> Okay, all right, cool.
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:52.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:55.380]   >> We've all heard about the hard way to learn, John.
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:57.380]   Is there an easy way to learn?
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:10.340]   >> If you begin and understand yourself thoroughly and you have a lot of raw experience, I think
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:16.740]   natural powers are released.
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:26.220]   And I do believe that all the graceful, easy learning comes from people who are comfortable
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:36.820]   inside their own skin because they understand and people who've had a lot of early experience.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:44.780]   And I operated on those principles even though it was illegal in a public school setting.
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:50.140]   I set aside one full day a week.
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:56.500]   I won't get into the politics of how this was pulled off, but it was never easy, where
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:05.860]   the kids could follow their own instincts anywhere in New York City they wanted to go.
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:14.660]   One full day a week where I took them on group projects, different parts of the five boroughs
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:24.900]   in New York City, group projects that would end up with a tangible goal, such as testing.
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:33.500]   Remember, this one might amuse the people watching this.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:42.140]   The New York Times announced on the front page about three weeks before the Ed Koch,
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:50.620]   Dave Dinkins election of, let me say, 1980, somewhere around there, that Dinkins was hopelessly
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:55.700]   behind by 17 points.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:59:02.540]   And I had a black kid in the class come up and ask me why the city was so prejudiced.
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:05.460]   And I said, "Why do you say that?"
[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:09.060]   And he said, "Well, look at this."
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:13.380]   And I said, "Why do you believe that's true?
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:16.260]   Maybe that's to get you not to go and vote."
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:23.380]   "I don't know," I said, "but I do know that it says here in small print that they only
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.540]   interviewed 300 people.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.900]   There's 8 million of us."
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:33.820]   I said, "There's 120 people in my five classes.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:41.980]   Of each one, you do 20 interviews, and we do it according to the way you get a random
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:46.460]   distribution, and that's easy enough to find out.
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:51.980]   Well, we can have many times larger samples than—"
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:55.020]   So that happened.
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:57.620]   We gathered the data.
[01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:59.580]   We processed it.
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:05.860]   And we discovered about a week after the Times said he was hopelessly behind that he actually
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:11.460]   was ahead by a fraction of one point.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:12.460]   That's quite askew.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.980]   The election came.
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:26.500]   He won in the closest race in New York history, but noticed that a random group of 120 13-year-olds
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:30.540]   had produced more accurate information.
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:39.820]   The math in the statistical processing is hardly daunting for a fifth grader.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:50.660]   So why aren't the 70 million captive schoolchildren involved in, if nothing else, data gathering,
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:56.620]   since obviously it's a crucial part of commerce?
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:04.980]   Well, there must be a reason they're not used that way, nor do they hear about statistical
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:11.380]   sampling until they're in college, for the most part.
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:13.780]   Why not?
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:22.940]   According to Alfred North Whitehead, one of the major mathematicians of the 20th century,
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:31.740]   other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the only crucial piece of math
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:40.540]   for everyone to learn is statistical sampling predictions, because the society, the economies
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:45.780]   organized around those things, the politics is organized around those things.
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:50.940]   He said that in Aims of Education, which I think was published in the mid-1940s.
[02:01:50.940 --> 02:02:00.100]   Well, you know, 60 years have gone by, and where is it?
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:03.700]   He's hardly a radical.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:07.620]   Is it possible to train fleas before you break their will?
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:14.100]   And what can one learn from the gene sequencing hobbies of 11-year-olds?
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:23.780]   I got a foundation award at a fancy hotel in Washington, D.C., I guess about 15 years
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:24.780]   ago.
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:28.940]   It was certainly a while ago.
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:40.260]   And sitting next to me was an 11-year-old boy receiving the same award from the foundation.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.060]   And I mean, I was tickled.
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:53.620]   He was this little skinny Chinese kid, and he has made some scientific breakthroughs.
[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:59.940]   So you know, I'm patronizing him the way I've been trained to do.
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:08.820]   And I said, "Well, how did you learn to sequence genes, you know, instead of swimming?"
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.820]   I'm a swimming champion.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:10.820]   I remember he said that to me.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:11.820]   I have a lot of medals.
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.940]   And he was a well-balanced 11-year-old kid.
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:22.660]   And these days, I understand he's a college professor in Seattle.
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:34.060]   But in any case, he said, "My uncle or my grandfather explained to me that the way you
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:41.620]   train fleas," he had a soft part in me because I used to go to Hubert's Flea Circus on 42nd
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:46.740]   Street and watch fleas draw Roman chariots and swing on trapezes.
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:50.140]   He said, "You've got to break their spirits.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:57.420]   If you put fleas in a container, they'll instantly leap off and head off in all directions
[02:03:57.420 --> 02:04:00.140]   because they have flea agendas.
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:02.620]   And even they don't all off in the same direction.
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:05.220]   They have individual agendas."
[02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:11.180]   So he says, "You've got to break that autonomy in the flea first.
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:18.300]   And the way you do that is you put them in a container, small, with a lid on.
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:24.940]   And the fleas keep attempting to follow their own agenda.
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:27.460]   And they strike themselves over and over again.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:34.100]   And if you come back in an hour or so, they're all huddled in a mass together.
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:38.220]   Now when you take the lid off, they don't even try to escape."
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:43.180]   Now he said, "You can impose your will on the flea."
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:51.140]   The minute the 11-year-old kid said that to me, I knew that I had been hired as the lid
[02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:53.260]   on the container.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:05:00.260]   Not that I hadn't sabotaged it somewhat, but nevertheless, that's what we all had been
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:02.300]   hired to do.
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:05.340]   And this principle was understood.
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:12.980]   Training fleas was a delight of emperors thousands of years ago.
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:20.180]   And whoever trained those fleas understood the principle and saw they could be applied,
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:29.420]   as it is in military training, to human beings, as it is in much religious training.
[02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:30.780]   Not all, but much.
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:35.700]   So you've got a character like Wundt who believes that children have no soul, and he's designing
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.260]   an education system.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:41.800]   And then you've got these Machiavellian techniques being layered in on top of it of how to break
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:45.500]   the will of animals, and it's being used to train our children.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:53.700]   Yeah, what's surprising is that these insights and even these activities that don't depend
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:59.780]   on modern technology, these are understood a long time ago.
[02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:08.500]   And the only subject at the Roman Collegia in the fifth century was, I'll put an umbrella
[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:11.140]   over it, crowd control.
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:19.860]   You know, how you divide to conquer, what buttons on the human organ you press to produce
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:20.860]   certain sounds.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:26.620]   I mean, that's 16 centuries ago.
[02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:30.060]   What has happened in the intervening 16 centuries?
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:31.660]   They forgot that?
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:33.740]   Or was it added to?
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:39.380]   Has it become amazingly sophisticated?
[02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:47.220]   Less and less people necessary to produce more and more leverage.
[02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:53.180]   Is there a connection between the ideals of someone like Calvin and his espousing a theocratic
[02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:59.340]   state and modern states like Israel, which are also built along the same theocratic terms?
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:08.540]   I think, and I'm trying to be as fair as possible to the villains in this, I think there's some
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:17.140]   impulsion in everyone to have certainty that even as babies were aware of how many accidents,
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:22.220]   how much menace is out there, jeopardy, certainty.
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:34.500]   So to follow a list of rules, algorithms, you know, is emotionally very satisfying,
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:39.780]   but it doesn't work if everyone's not doing it.
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:43.900]   You know, and the minute everyone's doing it, you don't have to do it.
[02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:52.980]   You now are handed freedom because the menace has been reduced of other people experimenting
[02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:57.620]   with humanity, enlarging its boundaries.
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:03.500]   And then economically, of course, your capital's at risk.
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:09.580]   If that's the overproduction thing, I hope we talked about that yesterday, because it
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:19.540]   finally was the tipping point in the late 19th century as corporations were enlarging
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:23.380]   and layering themselves.
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:32.140]   Men like Carnegie and Rockefeller and Anster, they were fully aware that human ingenuity
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:40.540]   was a tremendous risk to capital formation, because to talk people out of their wealth
[02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:46.860]   on the grounds that you can multiply it doesn't work.
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:55.220]   If too many people invent ways to do something better than your investment, you know, the
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:56.620]   capital's destroyed.
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:09:05.860]   So the easiest way to manage the future and the present, of course, they saw a series
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:12.500]   of financial crises all through history, but especially in the 19th century, where the
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:20.340]   boot of the master had been lifted off ordinary people, and they were recklessly inventive.
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:27.100]   I mean, America's producing more inventions than all the rest of the world put together.
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:33.660]   You can't have that, because on that new base, the next base is going to be frightening.
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:45.700]   So a term existed and exists, but it's been camouflaged in the 21st century called overproduction.
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:54.260]   You have to use government to control overproduction, dumping too many goods or services on the
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:56.820]   market that it can't absorb.
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:10:03.500]   And the easiest way to do that, at first you try licensing, you know, and other kinds of
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:08.220]   government subsidy to favored groups.
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:19.340]   But ultimately, the killer app is to remove the ability to be inventive from the ordinary
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:20.340]   mass.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:29.300]   These days, it's called overcapacity, because to penetrate what that means is much harder
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:34.220]   than to see instantly what overproduction means.
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:48.660]   Then a second menace emerged in the late 19th century, but by the late 1960s, it was clear
[02:10:48.660 --> 02:10:51.220]   it too would have to be controlled.
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:53.940]   That's called hyperdemocracy.
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:11:03.180]   If too many people take democracy seriously and understand how to form alliances with
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:13.500]   one another to confront power with power, then power becomes much less effective.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:24.460]   So when the kids stopped the Vietnamese War, waves of them, I mean, this was so intolerable,
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:34.340]   the cost to privileged classes of this reign of money, the cost to the government of not
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:40.780]   being able to suppress dissent on the grounds that this is an emergency.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:43.100]   This couldn't be allowed to happen again.
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:53.900]   The Trilateral Commission gave me the break I needed to understand this more precisely.
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:12:02.380]   They underwrote the publication of a book called The Crisis of Democracy in 1975, published
[02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:11.860]   by New York University Press, in which you have to have training in reading between the
[02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:22.620]   lines because the sophisticated power brokers aren't nakedly making these statements.
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:30.900]   But if you read Crisis of Democracy carefully, you will see that the crisis is too many people
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:40.940]   took it seriously and translated the principles into action and cost the industries and the
[02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:51.300]   hierarchy a war that, you know, now the next war would be harder to run.
[02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:55.900]   I mean, to get together, it would be more absurd.
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:02.500]   At least you can make a case in those jungles, but now you're going to have to make a case
[02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:08.180]   in the arid deserts of Iraq or in the mountains of Afghanistan.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:17.260]   Why national security depends on suppressing these barefoot people and people whose weapons
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:21.700]   are blowing up their feet and their underwear?
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:26.180]   Hey, they're going to take the bread out of your family's mouth.
[02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:36.940]   I remember the attempt in Nicaragua under the Sandinistas to communicate the idea that it
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:43.220]   was just a stone's throw from our southern border and these people might pile into their
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:52.060]   20 and 30 year old vehicles and that'd be this thousand mile drive north and into Texas
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:53.740]   and come.
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:14:02.940]   Well, you know, our economy, of course, cannot function without warfare so that when these
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:09.260]   things are over, count on the fact that if we have to attack the South Pole, the penguins
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:13.540]   will are clear and present danger.
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:20.060]   In the Paris Peace Conference 1919, pre-CFR formation, Colonel House and these characters
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:25.000]   are hanging out and Ho Chi Minh comes in and says, "We want to be free like America.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.320]   We love democracy.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:27.320]   We want to do this."
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:31.860]   And instead of helping them out, helping them to become free, they're like, "Well, we're
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:33.060]   going to have to take them out.
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:34.140]   That makes a good place to have them."
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:36.020]   We need enemies.
[02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:38.020]   We have to have enemies.
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:44.140]   The interesting thing about the book, The Crisis of Democracy, is that spreading out
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:51.780]   like ripples from a stone thrown in a pond, the popular magazines and press, Time Magazine
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:57.020]   did a cover story on too much democracy, question mark.
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:05.860]   Of course, they concluded, you bet, in a complicated high-tech world, you can't allow non-experts
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:10.820]   to make decisions there, but it was everywhere.
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:19.420]   So the Tom-Toms, they're interconnected and they beat simultaneously or nearly so.
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:23.660]   What's the role of curiosity?
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:29.100]   Is it not the lever that produces invention?
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:37.620]   I mean, it forces you really in a fun way to think for yourself there.
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:45.780]   And then it turns out that the secrets of nature or society aren't really very hard
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:50.180]   to penetrate as long as you remain curious.
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:52.300]   How do you destroy curiosity?
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:56.140]   We all say little babies are always curious.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:57.740]   How do you destroy curiosity?
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:05.740]   Well, one good way is to sit people in chairs, tell them to speak when you're spoken to,
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:15.860]   threaten them with upcoming tests if they don't memorize usually erroneous material.
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:16.860]   It's fascinating.
[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:25.260]   Show me a school book that deals with Admiral Perry's opening of Japan.
[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:33.700]   And the school book, the last one I looked, was nominally under the aegis of the Librarian
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:38.340]   of Congress, so a major scholar.
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:45.260]   And it will say that, essentially it will say that we decided that Japan should be part
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:46.260]   of the modern world.
[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:49.660]   It wasn't fair to leave them in medieval.
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:55.940]   And so Admiral Perry sailed over there and negotiated and they said, "Okay, you can
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:17:02.660]   have coaling bases or we'll take care of sunken warehouse."
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:11.620]   What no one says is that Perry had 11-inch naval rifles, the standard of the day.
[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:19.740]   The Japanese had medieval cannon with a range for about 75 yards and Perry's guns could
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:22.380]   reach 10 miles.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:31.340]   And that Perry emphasized the destructive impact of his force of three black gunboats.
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:38.380]   I mean, somebody had to actually paint the boats black by destroying some structures
[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:40.140]   on the shore.
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:47.460]   And they rode out fast enough and said, "Please, Masa."
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:53.020]   When did the American Dream become one of lifelong servitude and debt and slavery?
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:18:02.660]   It's so fascinating that the American Dream is enunciated in 1859 by Abraham Lincoln
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:07.300]   speaking to the Wisconsin Agricultural Association.
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:12.380]   That's 152 years ago.
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:23.420]   And he says the American Dream is to write your own script to have an independent livelihood.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:30.340]   That's why we don't have giant corporations like Britain and Germany have.
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:37.260]   People only work for somebody else long enough to put a stake together and they figure out
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:42.860]   what people need and then they do.
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:53.860]   So the American Dream was as elementary school books, it was liberty, freedom, personal sovereignty.
[02:18:53.860 --> 02:19:02.300]   And it was rather unique in the history of political nations around the earth or even
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:05.660]   tribal bodies.
[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:07.460]   And did it work?
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:16.620]   It almost immediately propelled us into a paramount position among the, just because
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:28.800]   there's a, I'm not hostile to, but I'm also a stranger to IT and the high tech world.
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.260]   But I do try to keep up with the theory of what's going on.
[02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:42.180]   About three or four years ago, there was a wonderful analytical book called The Cathedral
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:43.180]   and the Bazaar.
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:44.980]   Are you familiar with it?
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:48.300]   I don't remember who wrote it.
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:58.180]   And I read it and I saw almost immediately what I thought nature was about proving itself
[02:19:58.180 --> 02:20:00.020]   through IT.
[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:13.260]   The author or authors maintain that the crowd collectively has more wisdom and insight collectively
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:17.300]   and gave some hair raising examples.
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:27.940]   A huge gold ore body in Canada was discovered by the company putting its limit, it knew
[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:36.500]   that there had to be an ore body there, but it also knew that if it used the normal procedures
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:46.300]   and the hole proved dry, excuse the mixed metaphor there, that they would be exhausted
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:49.340]   and they would have to sell what they knew.
[02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:57.740]   It's a gold corp today, GG on the exchange.
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.020]   So how did they discover the ore body?
[02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:11.380]   Instead of going to the recognized engineers and blowing all their water on one shot, on
[02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:19.620]   the internet they globally put out to anyone at all from any background at all, they wanted
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:23.020]   a theory of how to find that ore body.
[02:21:23.020 --> 02:21:32.380]   And somebody who had nothing to do with mining pick up the book because I'm losing the richness
[02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:33.380]   of the details.
[02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:37.700]   But it's the essence of how non-experts can make some of the biggest discoveries.
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:42.420]   Oh well, there is a book, I made a note to bring up here.
[02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:48.860]   There's a book that used to be required reading at MIT and maybe still would be.
[02:21:48.860 --> 02:21:56.700]   It's by a middle level physicist named Robert Scott Root-Bernstein.
[02:21:56.700 --> 02:21:59.180]   It's called Creativity.
[02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:04.580]   It's this thick and the structure internally is so maddening.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:12.660]   It's done in the form of a group discussion among different people why he did that.
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:20.780]   But eventually I forced myself to read it and what just comes pouring out of it is how
[02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:26.260]   actual life world changing discoveries are made.
[02:22:26.260 --> 02:22:29.300]   This is an MIT textbook.
[02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:39.580]   Apparently by adding funds and assistance to a project you almost destroy your ability
[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:42.580]   to make these breakthroughs.
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:50.420]   People who have to saw ice cube trays in half to make a piece of lab equipment, etc., etc.
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:55.540]   are the people who transcend the conventional.
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:23:00.580]   Now that's often then taken over by a big project.
[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:06.700]   One of the most recent dramatic examples, and I'm sure you can Google or whatever the
[02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:14.940]   search engine term is, there was a two or three years ago in 60 Minutes, there was an
[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:29.740]   account of a new way to treat cancerous tumors with radiation without any side effects at
[02:23:29.740 --> 02:23:39.980]   all and it had been discovered by a man in his garage who had nothing to do with cancer
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:40.980]   research.
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:44.260]   John Kanzias is who you're talking about, right?
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:45.260]   John Kanzias?
[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:46.260]   Yes, Kanzias.
[02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:48.780]   And he worked in radio and television and he-
[02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:49.780]   He was a kid.
[02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:58.620]   He was an enthusiast and he knew that if you shot radio waves through metal that it heated
[02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:05.580]   up and he wondered if it would kill a tumor but not leave the devastation that radiation
[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:09.780]   does and in fact it did.
[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:12.860]   Now we don't have to take it on faith.
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:22.820]   The leading cancer researchers in the world said this is a whole new ballgame, you know,
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:28.140]   and some key research hospitals then took the process over.
[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:35.780]   And Kanzias' motivation was he was in the terminal stages of cancer himself and he knew
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:43.180]   that the established treatments wouldn't help him and in fact he was too far gone and he
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:44.180]   died.
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:51.700]   I think the thing is that you- Pittsburgh now but it's at some major universities but
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:25:01.900]   I heard the reigning expert in the world say this is- makes all the past, you know, irrelevant.
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:04.100]   But that's a commonality.
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:10.780]   I copied some notes out of the Ruth Bernstein book.
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:20.300]   He said that intensive and narrow scientific training will guarantee that you never make
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:23.060]   a scientific breakthrough.
[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:28.580]   You know, you can get the best Johns Hopkins, it doesn't matter.
[02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:31.620]   It's the narrowness of training.
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:38.780]   The people who make these breakthroughs have as wide a range of mental and physical tools
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:40.180]   as possible.
[02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:49.580]   They almost invariably play musical instruments, are good at languages, etc., etc.
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:57.660]   Most successful people in physics make it by going off by themselves and learning whatever
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:04.300]   they want to, not following the history of the physical sciences.
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:11.060]   What they learn from mentors is how to deal with ambiguity.
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:18.740]   But the established bodies of scientific knowledge get in the way of thinking afresh.
[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:24.740]   You know, as soon as you hear these things, they're so common sensical, you say, of course,
[02:26:24.740 --> 02:26:28.700]   why didn't I think of that?
[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:31.540]   Just a couple more here.
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:41.940]   Virtually every scientific pioneer, men like Edison, Franklin, Einstein, Planck, Maxwell,
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:49.900]   many others, had early opportunities to do absolutely independent research.
[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:57.540]   All of them were in their early 20s, which has given rise to an understanding in the
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:04.620]   higher levels of the sciences that if you haven't made a major breakthrough by your
[02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:09.140]   middle 20s, you're not going to.
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:16.740]   What you can do is head up a project and be a bureaucrat and take credit, as many college
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:20.820]   professors do, for the discoveries of your students.
[02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:25.780]   But you're not going to be worth gambling on.
[02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:30.860]   It isn't the age in itself that limits insight.
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:35.100]   It's the imprint of rigid patterns of habits.
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:46.260]   Now, I happen to dig up a wonderful quote from William James' psychology, I think printed
[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:56.620]   in 1890, and the book giving credit for establishing psychology as an academic subject.
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:05.900]   And James was, of course, he had ambivalent feelings, but he certainly was a disciple
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:08.420]   of Wundt there.
[02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:16.300]   Now, this is a direct quote from William James' psychology 121 years ago.
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:24.620]   "Habit is the enormous flywheel of society, its most precious agent.
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:34.100]   It alone saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the poor.
[02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:41.260]   It alone prevents the most repulsive jobs from being deserted.
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:44.660]   It holds the minor in his darkness.
[02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:50.060]   It keeps different social strata from mixing."
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:58.780]   Well, I'll just complete.
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:05.740]   One of the insights of discovering that really electrified me as I was reading it is how
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:14.380]   frequently the great discovery in the scientific arena is not made by the specialists in that
[02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:26.020]   area, by somebody from another area completely divorced who transfers into chemistry or physics,
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:34.820]   has fresh eyes, cuts through the habits that lock the mind in place, and makes the discovery.
[02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:43.020]   It says, "Freedom and flexibility is much more valuable than planning.
[02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:53.180]   It comes only by getting out of ruts and plugging into a variety of methods."
[02:29:53.180 --> 02:30:01.940]   So these great truths, it isn't that we're discovering them now.
[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:12.980]   We're taking them out of the burial places and saying, "Hey, look, wake up.
[02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:18.340]   The world is much bigger and much different than you believe it is because you've been
[02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:21.660]   conditioned to believe it's that way."
[02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:25.020]   I have something here.
[02:30:25.020 --> 02:30:37.420]   I have the six purposes of schooling as laid down in 1917 by the man who Harvard named
[02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:42.620]   their honor lecture in education for.
[02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:52.220]   So far from being a fringe individual, this guy is the reason the Harvard honor lecture
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:59.420]   in education is named as it is, the Ingalls lecture.
[02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:03.380]   Looks like Inglis, but it's pronounced Ingalls.
[02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:09.980]   And I would like to read you the six purposes of schooling.
[02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:16.580]   I moved heaven and earth and it took years to find this book, just like trying to find
[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:23.060]   in past years copy of Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope.
[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:34.220]   I learned about Ingalls from the 20-year president of Harvard, James Brian Conant, who was a
[02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:42.820]   poison gas specialist in World War I, was very inner circle of the atomic bomb project
[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:49.260]   World War II, was the high commissioner of occupied Germany after the war.
[02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:57.860]   So he wrote, oh, there must be 20 books about the institution of schooling of which he was
[02:31:57.860 --> 02:32:02.020]   completely a proponent.
[02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:05.500]   And I forced, he's a very, very bad writer.
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:14.060]   I forced myself to read most of these books and in one of them, he says that if you really
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:21.380]   want to know what school is about, you need to pick up the book that I'm referring to
[02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:25.620]   here, Principles of Secondary Education.
[02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:35.820]   Two years it took me to find a copy of the book, 750 pages, tiny print, and as dull as
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:39.580]   your imagination can conceive.
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:45.460]   And furthermore, it's not until you get to the very middle of the book in an unlabeled
[02:32:45.460 --> 02:32:48.940]   section that he spills the beans.
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:51.580]   Let me spill them for you.
[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:57.900]   These are the six purposes or functions as he calls them.
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:02.980]   The first he calls the adjustive function.
[02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:10.100]   Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority.
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:15.900]   That's their main purpose, habits of reaction to authority.
[02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:26.900]   That's why school authorities don't tear their hair out when somebody exposes that the atomic
[02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:36.900]   bomb wasn't dropped on Korea as a history book in 1990s printed by Scott Forsman distributed
[02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:42.860]   and why each of these books has hundreds of substantive errors.
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:47.620]   Tearing isn't the reason the texts are distributed.
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:53.180]   So first is the adjustive function, fixed habits.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:34:03.940]   Now here comes the wonderful insight that being able to analyze the detail will give
[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:05.420]   you.
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:13.200]   How can you establish whether someone has successfully developed this automatic reaction
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:21.460]   because people have a proclivity when they're given sensible orders to follow it.
[02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:23.580]   That's not what they want to reach.
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:31.740]   The only way you can measure this is to give stupid orders and people automatically follow
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:32.740]   those.
[02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:38.900]   So when you've achieved function one, have you ever wondered why some of the foolish
[02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:44.060]   things schools do are allowed to continue?
[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:50.020]   Number two he calls, he calls it the integrating function, but it's easier to understand if
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:53.500]   you call it the conformity function.
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:35:01.100]   It's to make children as alike as possible, the gifted children and the stupid as alike
[02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:11.660]   as possible because market research uses statistical sampling and it only works if people react
[02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:15.140]   generally the same way.
[02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:20.940]   The third function he calls the directive function.
[02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:30.940]   School is to diagnose your proper social role and then to log the evidence that here is
[02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:38.100]   where you are in the great pyramid so that future people won't allow you to escape that
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:40.180]   compartment.
[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:45.780]   The fourth function is the differentiating function.
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:54.820]   Once you've diagnosed kids in this layer, you do not want them to learn anything that
[02:35:54.820 --> 02:35:57.780]   the higher layers are learning.
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:04.700]   So you teach just as far as the requirements of that layer.
[02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:09.460]   Number five and six are the creepiest of all.
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:13.980]   Number five is the selective function.
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:19.340]   What that means is what Darwin meant by natural selection.
[02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:25.780]   You're assessing the breeding quality of each individual kid.
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:30.860]   You're doing it structurally because school teachers don't know this is happening.
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:40.300]   And you're trying to use ways to prevent the poor stuff from breeding and those ways are
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:47.580]   hanging labels, humiliating labels around their neck, encouraging the shallowness of
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:48.580]   thinking.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:57.140]   You know, I often wondered because I came from a very, very strict Scotch Irish culture
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:37:00.060]   that never allowed you to lure the girl.
[02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:07.300]   Well, when I got to New York City, the boys were pawing the girls openly and there was
[02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:13.340]   really no redress for the girls at all, except not showing up in the classroom.
[02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:16.260]   You know, high absentee rates.
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:28.780]   Well, you're supposed to teach structurally that sexual pleasure is what you withdraw
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:35.220]   from a relationship and everything else is a waste of time and expensive.
[02:37:35.220 --> 02:37:42.340]   So the selective function is what Darwin meant by the favored races.
[02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:48.260]   The idea is to consciously improve the breeding stock.
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:57.700]   Schools are meant to tag the unfit with their inferiority by poor grades, remedial placement,
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:05.220]   humiliation, so that their peers will accept them as inferior.
[02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:12.140]   And the good breeding stock among the females will reject them as possible partners.
[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:21.140]   And the sixth is the creepiest of all, and I think it's partly what Tragedy and Hope
[02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:22.140]   is about.
[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:28.180]   It's a fancy Roman name, the propaedutic function.
[02:38:28.180 --> 02:38:37.180]   Because as early as Roman big time thinkers, it was understood that to continue a social
[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:46.620]   form required some people being trained, that they were the custodians of this.
[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:54.740]   So some small fraction of the kids are being ready to take over the project.
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:57.980]   That's the guy in the honor lecture.
[02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:07.380]   It will not surprise you that his ancestors include the major general at the siege of
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:14.700]   Lucknow in India, famous for tying the mutineers on the muzzles of the cannons and blowing
[02:39:14.700 --> 02:39:25.940]   them apart, or somebody who was forced to flee New York City, a churchman at the beginning
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:34.300]   of the American Revolution, because he wrote a refutation of Thomas Paine's common sense.
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:36.740]   They were going to tar and feather him.
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:44.660]   He fled and was rewarded by the British by making him the Bishop of Nova Scotia.
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:49.500]   Those are Engels' ancestors.
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:40:01.220]   So Al Engels is certainly, when I learned of this and wrote to Harvard asking for access
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:11.220]   to the Engels lecture, strike me dead, Lord, if I'm exaggerating at all, I was told, "Well,
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:14.940]   we have no, there is no Engels lecture.
[02:40:14.940 --> 02:40:20.100]   It hasn't been for years and we have no records."
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:31.420]   It was the same thing that happened when I discovered that Elwood P. Cumberley, the most
[02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:41.180]   influential schoolman of the 20th century and the bionomics genius, had been the elementary
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:47.740]   school editor of Houghton Mifflin, and I wrote Houghton Mifflin, "Is there any records?"
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:51.780]   And they said, "We have no record of anyone named Elwood P. Cumberley."
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:55.700]   Now Harvard's telling me there's no Engels lecture.
[02:40:55.700 --> 02:41:06.180]   A week passed and I got a call from Harvard, from some obscure office at Harvard, saying,
[02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:12.300]   "What is your interest in the Engels lecture?"
[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:17.540]   I knew that I was on thin ice.
[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:29.220]   And I said, "Well, James Conant referred me in his books to the man the Engels lecture
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:30.220]   is named after.
[02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:39.820]   And I was wondering if I could get some background on this fellow and a list of the lectures."
[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:49.700]   And in due time, I got a list of the lectures and instructions how to access the texts,
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:50.700]   but not easily.
[02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:58.740]   You know, enough hoops that someone who has to mow the lawn and burp the baby, you know,
[02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:02.580]   wouldn't jump through those hoops.
[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:09.660]   I was able to prove Harper's Wooden Publish, when they did the cover essay I wrote, which
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:16.300]   Lou Latham named against school, probably after Jeremiah's against.
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:22.780]   But I had called the Artificial Extension of Childhood, because I think that's the
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:27.620]   key mechanism at work here.
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:40.380]   So they wouldn't print the information about Coverley, because Mifflin denied it.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:49.020]   It was only months afterward that I looked through my extensive library of incredibly
[02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:55.780]   dull books about schooling and opened in the facing page, said, "Edward Coverley, Editor
[02:42:55.780 --> 02:43:04.580]   in Chief, Elementary School, Publishing Arm of Mifflin."
[02:43:04.580 --> 02:43:11.420]   By the way, the secondary editor in chief was Alexander Ingalls.
[02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:19.140]   So you see how this cousinage, the incest works.
[02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:24.980]   If Martin Luther's idea was to cut out the middleman and teachers read books, why can't
[02:43:24.980 --> 02:43:29.860]   students just read books instead of going to the middleman for their information?
[02:43:29.860 --> 02:43:40.340]   The more highly placed the schooling is, the more likely it is that they do do that.
[02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:43.100]   They go to primary documents.
[02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:48.580]   They understand how suspicious all secondary documents are.
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:57.140]   Not that they aren't useful, but they give the writer or the editorial staff the ability
[02:43:57.140 --> 02:44:00.740]   to shift the information.
[02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:08.300]   That's why in the reprints of Quigley's Tragedy and Hope, we really need some of you out there
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:16.340]   to sit with the original and sit with the reprint and make sure the key things aren't
[02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:17.340]   elated.
[02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:25.660]   On perfectly reasonable grounds that we want to shrink this down from 1300 pages to a thousand
[02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:26.660]   or whatever.
[02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:31.220]   Oh, it was an oversize.
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:34.140]   We have eight minutes, nine minutes left.
[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:39.900]   I have two questions and then we can do an informal book signing and get you out of here.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:50.180]   Yeah, well, you should want to know what happens to an ordinary class of 13 year olds when
[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:53.460]   they get a smattering of that.
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:58.820]   I mean, as much as I can absorb in a short time.
[02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:06.740]   Well, many of you will have seen Strawberry Fields, the monument to the Beatles in Central
[02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:07.740]   Park.
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:13.220]   I don't want to pat myself on the back because I didn't much care for the Beatles and I hate
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:15.540]   using Parkland for it.
[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:23.140]   But I was approached by three girls, two of them here, bitterly complaining that the community
[02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:31.460]   planning board had denied Yoko Ono's petition to build Strawberry Fields.
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:34.940]   And they were furious that this had been done.
[02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:37.940]   And I said, well, you don't have to accept their decision.
[02:45:37.940 --> 02:45:41.940]   They're the lowest part of the pecking order.
[02:45:41.940 --> 02:45:47.860]   First, according to protocol, you have to take your case to them.
[02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:54.240]   So we'll book you an appointment and you lay down the reasons you want to take three acres
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:46:00.900]   of Central Park and give it to this group who could only play three musical chords.
[02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:07.260]   But I told them, whatever you want to do, including building a pistol, I'll show you
[02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:09.980]   how you can learn how to do that.
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:12.740]   I won't censor.
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:20.940]   So it had been voted down 45 to 8 by the community planning board and the community planning
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:25.220]   board unanimously rejected their appeal.
[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:31.820]   I said, now you want to look who has to sign off on their decision.
[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:36.580]   This is not a group of local big shots.
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:40.380]   This is the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:46.540]   You don't get on that unless your ancestors come over on the Mayflower or you have $10
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:47.540]   billion.
[02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:51.340]   I said, this is the elite of the elite.
[02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:59.060]   And now what you want to do is research the names are publicly accessible, 23 of them,
[02:46:59.060 --> 02:47:05.220]   and I'll bet four or five of them would already be in favor of this thing.
[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:11.900]   All you need is 12 of them to reject this for it to happen.
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:18.540]   So you find out who these people are and get as much biographical information.
[02:47:18.540 --> 02:47:25.620]   You know, IT has made this on these people and you will find the buttons to play them
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:27.380]   like an oval organ.
[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:35.140]   You know, you can find out what causes they became noteworthy for, etc., etc.
[02:47:35.140 --> 02:47:41.140]   And now what you're going to do, because there's 12,000 kids in this school district, is I'm
[02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:45.580]   going to free you from school for a month and you're going to split up.
[02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:50.940]   You go from school to school, find troublemakers and get petitions.
[02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:58.940]   Because what we need, because your letterhead will say committee of 5,000, we need 5,000
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:01.820]   signatures on a petition.
[02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:08.540]   And you're going to write an individual letter writing campaign to each of the 23 members
[02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:18.140]   of the community planning board asking them to please immortalize this group.
[02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:26.220]   Well, I get a phone call in the front office, I'm summoned out of class, I was six weeks
[02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:31.340]   later and the voice on the phone says, "Hello, this is Yoko Ono."
[02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:35.340]   You know, I thought it was one of my cockamamie friends.
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:40.820]   I said, "You know, this is George Washington, Yoko, what's on your mind?"
[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:45.420]   Fortunately, she didn't take umbrage, maybe even here in Santa.
[02:48:45.420 --> 02:48:49.540]   She said, "The decision has been reversed.
[02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:55.300]   I'm going to hold a party at the Dakota for these girls.
[02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:57.780]   Could they be released from school?"
[02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:02.740]   I don't know, Yoko, I'm going to miss a lot.
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:05.180]   So that's one.
[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:07.300]   Look at this one.
[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:15.820]   Here's a 12-year-old C student from, well, he lived in, well, he was a C student but
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:17.300]   he's a polite young fellow.
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:24.820]   He was going nowhere there and he went to, he had the effrontery to go to a pizza parlor
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:29.020]   in all white Upper West Side in 1980.
[02:49:29.020 --> 02:49:36.140]   The owner of the parlor, a 6'6" crazy Greek who happened to be a friend of mine, took
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:40.140]   his pizza, took his soda, threw them away.
[02:49:40.140 --> 02:49:44.180]   The charge was he had taken two straws.
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:47.220]   You only let one straw, right?
[02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:51.460]   So he comes over ranting about racial prejudice.
[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:56.980]   I said, "It was the wrong thing to do and I'm going to show you how to deal with it."
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:50:00.060]   But I don't think it was racial prejudice.
[02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:04.660]   His clientele at lunch comes from the collegiate school.
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:06.940]   They wear blue blazers, gold buttons.
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:09.580]   John F. Kennedy's kid went there.
[02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:17.620]   They leave big tips for his staff and he knows the public school kids, black or white, go
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:23.540]   in there for lunch and he's going to lose that blue ribbon trade.
[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:28.060]   Nonetheless, you're going to give him a chance to back down.
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:36.020]   This is an absolutely massive insane Greek who believes violence is the solution to all
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:37.020]   problems.
[02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:43.380]   Once Jerry Mulligan, the famous jazz saxophonist, bounced a $10 check.
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:49.420]   He had it blown up to billboard size and mounted outside the restaurant.
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:58.260]   I said, "You go to the phone and I'll listen and you say, 'I'm the guy's pizza you took,
[02:50:58.260 --> 02:51:03.420]   but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones if I could.'"
[02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:04.420]   Nick hangs up on him.
[02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:09.700]   I said, "I'm going to give you what in law is called an affidavit that you attempted
[02:51:09.700 --> 02:51:12.460]   to solve this problem peaceably."
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:21.500]   Now I said, "You want to go over there in person tomorrow and I'll provide a long distance
[02:51:21.500 --> 02:51:25.620]   witness and you want to say, 'Look, it's just a slice of pizza.
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:28.380]   Give me my slice of pizza back.'"
[02:51:28.380 --> 02:51:32.660]   But Nick had the bid between how the kid goes.
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:38.500]   And now I said, "You're going to call him one more time with a different teacher as
[02:51:38.500 --> 02:51:45.580]   a witness, then you're going to write him a letter, certified return receipt requested,
[02:51:45.580 --> 02:51:48.020]   65 cents in those days.
[02:51:48.020 --> 02:51:54.140]   And now you have four pieces of evidence to provide to the court and then you're going
[02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:57.140]   to sue his ass in small claims court."
[02:51:57.140 --> 02:52:03.700]   Only cost like $3 in those days, but it was 17 miles from the school.
[02:52:03.700 --> 02:52:05.100]   Kids can't sue.
[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:08.300]   I said, "Anyone with $3 can sue.
[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:10.640]   That doesn't mean you're going to win."
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:17.740]   But the way the referee in small claims court decides, since it's one person's, is who has
[02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:21.780]   evidence that they acted reasonably.
[02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:27.700]   And you will have four pieces of evidence and this guy will be steam coming out of his
[02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:31.900]   ear while he was awarded triple damages.
[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:34.060]   How about that?
[02:52:34.060 --> 02:52:42.620]   Now, what do you suppose the small claims court referee said when he got home that night
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:43.620]   to his friend?
[02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:48.140]   "You're not going to believe what I just adjudicated."
[02:52:48.140 --> 02:52:55.300]   So beginning about four days later, we got a call from the Brooklyn College Law School.
[02:52:55.300 --> 02:52:56.940]   Could he come over and lecture?
[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:58.380]   Of course he said no.
[02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:01.260]   And I said, "Listen, I'll ruin you if you don't.
[02:53:01.260 --> 02:53:02.380]   We'll work it out."
[02:53:02.380 --> 02:53:04.940]   And Columbia Law School called.
[02:53:04.940 --> 02:53:12.100]   Then we got daily calls from judges to take him out to lunch because isn't this a symbol
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:15.780]   that the system really...
[02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:17.980]   Okay.
[02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:24.220]   He's the only kid in 30 years of teaching that took my advice not to waste your time
[02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:25.500]   in high school.
[02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:31.900]   I said, "Any number of very good colleges will take you in at the end of your sophomore
[02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:36.620]   year if you provide the documentation.
[02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:38.220]   You're ready."
[02:53:38.220 --> 02:53:46.540]   He went to Duke, full tuition scholarship, then Duke University Law School.
[02:53:46.540 --> 02:53:58.340]   And by the way, these two events, Strawberry Fields and Pizza Palace, are from the same
[02:53:58.340 --> 02:54:00.700]   term in junior high school.
[02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:04.980]   Just a few more of these things.
[02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:08.460]   Here's a PhD from UCAL.
[02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:17.380]   Here's a 13-year-old girl who came to me complaining that her mother was a liar, said she could
[02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:22.940]   go to Paris alone that summer if she could raise the money.
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:24.660]   I just checked and nobody...
[02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:28.460]   I mean, she was a single parent household.
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:29.460]   Mother was a secretary.
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:30.460]   She said, "Nobody."
[02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:37.460]   I said, "Well, you can't do it on a job, but it's not very much money if you have a little
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:38.460]   business."
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:43.500]   And she said, "13-year-old kids can't have businesses."
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:49.060]   I said, "If you have something people want, they don't care how old you are."
[02:54:49.060 --> 02:54:55.380]   I mean, Sean Fanning almost ruined the music business with Napster.
[02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:58.460]   He was 17.
[02:54:58.460 --> 02:55:07.100]   So she takes a week out of school, figures out a really interesting exotic business that
[02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:13.700]   you can read my book and find out what it was, and raises enough money in a short time
[02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:20.300]   by cutting school for six consecutive weeks that she could afford to pay her mother's
[02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:21.300]   way to Paris.
[02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:23.660]   She came to me and said, "I've got much more money than I need."
[02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:25.660]   I said, "Why don't you take your mother to Paris?
[02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:28.140]   She might appreciate it."
[02:55:28.140 --> 02:55:35.060]   On the basis of that, she went to what I believe is the finest college in the United States,
[02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:41.260]   Hampshire College, where you write your own curriculum and then you negotiate with the
[02:55:41.260 --> 02:55:42.260]   faculty.
[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:47.220]   My granddaughter goes there and will be graduating next year.
[02:55:47.220 --> 02:55:49.220]   Hello, Christina.
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:52.220]   That's all I'll say.
[02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:56.660]   >> What phrase in Icelandic means writing of God?
[02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:57.660]   >> Yes.
[02:55:57.660 --> 02:56:06.020]   It's a, her real name was, is carried popularly as Gudrun, but she wasn't satisfied, so she
[02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:09.500]   went to court and changed it to Christina.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:12.260]   So hey, you know, what are you going to do?
[02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:16.780]   >> If you could say something that would echo through time and each and every person from
[02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:20.140]   now until the end of humanity would hear it.
[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:21.140]   >> Yeah.
[02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:29.900]   >> Sensible children do not wish to be incomplete human beings.
[02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:38.820]   And so when you impose a stage theory of human development upon them, you affect or tormenting
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:42.840]   them, you're limiting their opportunity.
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:50.540]   The whole world for all history knew that childhood is over about the age of seven,
[02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:57.820]   and if it persists beyond the age of 12, you've got some hopeless human being on your mind.
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:01.820]   Don't be your kid's enemy because they're not a kid.
[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:06.060]   That's a fellow human being, male or female.
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:12.220]   Be their partner and enlarge the opportunities.
[02:57:12.220 --> 02:57:19.780]   No homework, please.
[02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:23.460]   >> What does a college education really get you in the 21st century?
[02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:32.060]   >> I think it's consistently given less and less.
[02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:43.540]   It essentially was the last hoop to jump through, but it never delivered much to most of the
[02:57:43.540 --> 02:57:45.780]   people who jumped through that hoop.
[02:57:45.780 --> 02:57:55.300]   It is possible if you understand that an education is something you have to take to use the resources
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:58:02.740]   that are assembled there and actually stitch together an education for yourself, get some
[02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:03.820]   value.
[02:58:03.820 --> 02:58:11.540]   But most people, of course, follow a prescribed plan, which has been put together by a committee
[02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:17.900]   somewhere, and in fact, doesn't do much for most people.
[02:58:17.900 --> 02:58:28.020]   I went to Cornell, Columbia, and Reed College, and I can guarantee from Cornell and Columbia,
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:38.580]   I remember nothing except the babes, the alcohol, hangovers, et cetera.
[02:58:38.580 --> 02:58:53.580]   From Reed, I got a little bit out of a Plato seminar that I do remember basically arguing
[02:58:53.580 --> 02:58:59.020]   with the professor who encouraged that.
[02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:07.820]   It doesn't give you a bang for your buck unless you commit, which who does?
[02:59:07.820 --> 02:59:14.900]   Isn't it supposed to produce a certificate that certifies you as eligible?
[02:59:14.900 --> 02:59:23.500]   The funny thing is that IT has accidentally exploded a lot of that because so many people,
[02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:30.820]   I remember when my daughter graduated from MIT, and she used to bitterly complain that
[02:59:30.820 --> 02:59:38.740]   her classmates would vanish for months at a time doing jobs for various companies, then
[02:59:38.740 --> 02:59:43.620]   come back as if nothing had happened and nobody punished them.
[02:59:43.620 --> 02:59:53.300]   Sorry to say that we were so slow picking up on.
[02:59:53.300 --> 03:00:03.980]   We judge people by performance, not by credentials, and real people, you'd be insane to hire on
[03:00:03.980 --> 03:00:13.500]   the basis of credentials because the skew between memory and application is so large
[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:19.460]   that eventually you're top heavy with people who don't know how to do anything much.
[03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:23.420]   I'm going to ask this last question.
[03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:24.420]   Go burn your DVD.
[03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:27.140]   That way you're not late.
[03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:31.540]   So just answer to Jitu and Tony and Kevin.
[03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:39.260]   What is the value of persistence as juxtaposed to the learning process?
[03:00:39.260 --> 03:00:55.060]   About 10 years ago, I helped to set up a foundation that at Edison High School in New Jersey awards
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:01:04.540]   $10,000 a year to the most persistent student in the class.
[03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:09.340]   Persistence in the face of adversity is the final test.
[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:15.860]   If you can stick to something, nothing is difficult to learn.
[03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:27.740]   I mean nothing at all, but the natural selection process operating on a low boredom quotient,
[03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:37.500]   and personal disrespect, I can't do that, and many other things eliminates almost everyone
[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:41.540]   except the persistent.
[03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:44.420]   Those are the ones who demonstrate merit.
[03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:53.300]   Now obviously a lot of the control mechanism is inherited or appointed, but the parts that
[03:01:53.300 --> 03:02:02.900]   aren't go to the persistent, and that includes the arts and the sciences as well as politics.
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:14.620]   I mean who could imagine, for example, that an obviously inferior human being, I'm not
[03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:25.180]   speaking politically here, like George W. Bush, could pass through all the screens on
[03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:33.060]   the way up and then be elected not once but twice by the American population.
[03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:42.860]   He flunked his pilot's course, 25 out of 100, and now he's supposed to be given a jet to
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:49.060]   fly in combat, but of course he pulled strings he didn't do that.
[03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:53.260]   Clearly he was an imbecile.
[03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:58.860]   He looked like an imbecile, he talked like an imbecile, and you cannot believe that any
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:04.100]   decisions attributed to him were actually made by him.
[03:03:04.100 --> 03:03:10.420]   No one would be crazy enough to put him in charge and say you mind the store and I'll
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:12.420]   go off.
[03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:21.940]   But he was persistent and he did reject the negative assessments that occurred all through
[03:03:21.940 --> 03:03:23.380]   his life.
[03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:34.140]   What a rock is about, in my opinion, is showing daddy that the people who embarrassed daddy
[03:03:34.140 --> 03:03:41.580]   got their comeuppance and who the hell cares that the carnage is one of the great mass
[03:03:41.580 --> 03:03:52.180]   murders in history, but daddy's reputation was saved from disgrace.
[03:03:52.180 --> 03:03:57.460]   What do you feel the role of UNESCO has been in the manipulation of the educational curriculum?
[03:03:57.460 --> 03:04:11.300]   Well, I'm bothered a little bit by the general mass of conspiracy literature attributes powers
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:14.860]   to the United Nations, which it simply doesn't have.
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:20.140]   That doesn't mean that it isn't filled with villainous intentions.
[03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:29.260]   I mean that it never succeeded in becoming, people say it's a respectable institution,
[03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:36.220]   but they don't behave, no one says what does the UN say about, no one says that.
[03:04:36.220 --> 03:04:39.460]   And they've always given up trying.
[03:04:39.460 --> 03:04:46.700]   I mean there's now a minority opinion that it's not worth spending the money to have
[03:04:46.700 --> 03:04:55.780]   it in the United States, you know, because it's as much anti-American as it carries out
[03:04:55.780 --> 03:04:58.580]   our subtler designs.
[03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:05.580]   I've noticed that UNESCO focuses a lot of their workings on the educational work of
[03:05:05.580 --> 03:05:06.580]   nations.
[03:05:06.580 --> 03:05:08.140]   Oh yeah, but you and I would too.
[03:05:08.140 --> 03:05:11.220]   Yeah, yeah, of course.
[03:05:11.220 --> 03:05:20.340]   Well, wouldn't anyone say it's easier to deal with unformed minds with no experience?
[03:05:20.340 --> 03:05:21.340]   Wean them away.
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:29.500]   Yeah, I mean, it just, it's an engineering sense what you would expect to happen.
[03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:36.660]   And so we wouldn't be surprised if that's what does happen.
[03:05:36.660 --> 03:05:43.060]   Who was Johann Pestalozzi and what were some of his new ideas?
[03:05:43.060 --> 03:05:51.300]   The most intriguing thing about the followers of Pestalozzi are that they never count the
[03:05:51.300 --> 03:06:00.000]   fact that every single one of his projects quickly failed, every single one of them.
[03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:07.940]   What he had that was intriguing to the Prussian hierarchy and really the global hierarchy
[03:06:07.940 --> 03:06:19.580]   was that his method of kindness, and it may have been sincere, his method of kindness
[03:06:19.580 --> 03:06:28.420]   was a new weapon in the arsenal of instead of whipping the poor, threatening them, menacing
[03:06:28.420 --> 03:06:34.140]   them, tormenting them, you killed them with kindness.
[03:06:34.140 --> 03:06:44.540]   The written principles of the Fabians are Pestalozzian, you know, by extending this
[03:06:44.540 --> 03:06:48.860]   blanket of kindness to people.
[03:06:48.860 --> 03:07:02.860]   It's still effective in that, you know, lots of, a big fraction of the American population
[03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:07.900]   expects charity and sees it as a blessing.
[03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:15.660]   Now, it's not hard to see why on this day or that day it could be a blessing, but overall
[03:07:15.660 --> 03:07:21.940]   that you get weaker and weaker, like your arm gets weaker if it doesn't lift stuff above
[03:07:21.940 --> 03:07:22.940]   your head.
[03:07:22.940 --> 03:07:31.860]   I mean, it's such a fundamental principle of human physics, including mental physics,
[03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:37.260]   that to pull the wool over so many people's eyes.
[03:07:37.260 --> 03:07:45.740]   I've got your disc, it's got all the transcripts from your Gnostic Media interviews, you also
[03:07:45.740 --> 03:07:50.660]   have a definition of liberal and some Gordon Watson information for it.
[03:07:50.660 --> 03:07:56.340]   You also talked about the crews to open up Asia.
[03:07:56.340 --> 03:08:05.780]   This is Taft, it's Roosevelt's daughter, Roosevelt's president, Taft goes with her, and they open
[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:10.620]   up, they go back to Japan after, who was the admiral that you mentioned that went over
[03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:11.620]   there?
[03:08:11.620 --> 03:08:12.620]   Oh, not Dewey.
[03:08:12.620 --> 03:08:21.940]   But you know what I'm saying, they had already gone over there, and this was the second one,
[03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:27.060]   and then this sets up the whole World War II, World War I, the whole scenario, the opium
[03:08:27.060 --> 03:08:28.780]   smuggling, it's all in there.
[03:08:28.780 --> 03:08:32.220]   And this guy wrote Flags of Our Fathers and Flyboys?
[03:08:32.220 --> 03:08:33.220]   Oh yes.
[03:08:33.220 --> 03:08:34.220]   James Bradley?
[03:08:34.220 --> 03:08:35.220]   Yes.
[03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:36.220]   He's a great guy.
[03:08:36.220 --> 03:08:37.220]   I thought you might want to talk to him.
[03:08:37.220 --> 03:08:38.220]   Thank you, I will.
[03:08:38.220 --> 03:08:39.220]   You'll enjoy it.
[03:08:39.220 --> 03:08:43.220]   And you did an outstanding job.
[03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:53.260]   Hey, this has been a lovely course in how complicated it is, you know, to make a...
[03:08:53.260 --> 03:08:56.260]   To get the word out.
[03:08:56.260 --> 03:08:58.260]   Have you seen this book?
[03:08:58.260 --> 03:09:02.780]   It's called The Perfectibilists, it's by Terry Mullinson.
[03:09:02.780 --> 03:09:03.780]   No.
[03:09:03.780 --> 03:09:07.060]   That was the name of the Illuminati before it was known as the Illuminati, it was the
[03:09:07.060 --> 03:09:09.060]   Perfectibilists, and they were a private club.
[03:09:09.060 --> 03:09:13.060]   And this means "per me caci vita," it means "through me the blind become sighted," so
[03:09:13.060 --> 03:09:15.300]   their top secret is the trivium and learning.
[03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:19.020]   But they use it out of order, so they don't establish what exists first, they assert logic
[03:09:19.020 --> 03:09:20.020]   without...
[03:09:20.020 --> 03:09:21.020]   No, no, no.
[03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:24.500]   If you look in the back, it has a full glossary of individuals.
[03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:25.500]   Of all members.
[03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:26.500]   Yeah, he's cataloged.
[03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:29.780]   Now, this is my copy, but I want you to take it, and I can get another one.
[03:09:29.780 --> 03:09:30.780]   And then you can...
[03:09:30.780 --> 03:09:31.780]   God bless.
[03:09:31.780 --> 03:09:32.780]   I'm Chris Milligan.
[03:09:32.780 --> 03:09:33.780]   God bless.
[03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:38.860]   This here is the reference of Carl Wundt, and it goes into some of his colleagues, and
[03:09:38.860 --> 03:09:41.420]   you'll have a lot of references to your own material.
[03:09:41.420 --> 03:09:43.900]   Thank you all, and certainly...
[03:09:43.900 --> 03:09:46.900]   Now you got a heavy bag to carry.
[03:09:46.900 --> 03:09:48.900]   Now I got a heavy bag to carry.
[03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:56.900]   Let me get your mic off, yeah?
[03:09:56.900 --> 03:10:00.980]   Yes.
[03:10:00.980 --> 03:10:05.340]   You've now experienced the first step of the Ultimate History Lesson.
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:09.620]   We've done the hard work of organizing the facts, and now it's up to you to think, learn,
[03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:11.820]   communicate, and take action among yourselves.
[03:10:11.820 --> 03:10:16.500]   But we don't expect you to do this alone, and in fact, since this message applies to
[03:10:16.500 --> 03:10:22.500]   all of us, it's truly a circumstance which unites us and makes us indivisible, so that
[03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:27.180]   we might deliver freedom and justice, not just to ourselves, but to people around the
[03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:28.560]   world.
[03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:33.460]   If there is a point to all of this, it might be in realizing that the system isn't broken.
[03:10:33.460 --> 03:10:36.140]   It was built this way, on purpose.
[03:10:36.140 --> 03:10:41.420]   It serves those who created it, not those who are managed by it.
[03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:45.860]   As a result, our potential as human beings has been undermined.
[03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:53.260]   Our birthright has been stolen, and our adolescent period of life has been extended indefinitely.
[03:10:53.260 --> 03:10:59.760]   We have been numbed to these facts, which have been obscured further by the 15,000 hours
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:05.180]   of public schooling, which is mandatory in order to earn the right to live and work in
[03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:07.660]   our civilized culture.
[03:11:07.660 --> 03:11:12.020]   We have been under the impression that public schooling was about educating us, as a measure
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:17.420]   to prepare us for life, but those assumptions were formed based upon information supplied
[03:11:17.420 --> 03:11:25.900]   to us by our natural predators, who may dress and speak like us, but in their minds, intentions,
[03:11:25.900 --> 03:11:29.820]   and actions, they hold us in contempt.
[03:11:29.820 --> 03:11:35.980]   They manage us like livestock, and they poison us both figuratively and literally, as if
[03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:38.020]   we were pests.
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:44.900]   Each of us has a choice to make, and the question is, what is most important to us?
[03:11:44.900 --> 03:11:50.180]   Is it the products which money buys, or is it having a safe, happy, and healthy family?
[03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:54.220]   Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that we can have both in this culture.
[03:11:54.220 --> 03:11:59.300]   We must choose to either put our full support behind that which is most important to us,
[03:11:59.300 --> 03:12:01.720]   or face losing everything.
[03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:06.600]   I made that choice eight years ago, and through the help of some friends, I transformed the
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:12.460]   materials around me into the resources which have delivered this message to you.
[03:12:12.460 --> 03:12:18.340]   In the minutes before Patrick Henry spoke into existence the phrase, "Give me liberty,
[03:12:18.340 --> 03:12:25.580]   or give me death," in his speech to the Second Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775,
[03:12:25.580 --> 03:12:33.180]   he first addressed the convention's president, Peyton Randolph of Williamsburg.
[03:12:33.180 --> 03:12:39.780]   For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery,
[03:12:39.780 --> 03:12:46.100]   and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject, ought to be the freedom of debate.
[03:12:46.100 --> 03:12:52.080]   It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and to fulfill the great responsibility
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:55.720]   which we hold to God and country.
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:13:02.280]   Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:08.940]   myself guilty of treason towards my country, and an act of disloyalty toward the majesty
[03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:14.700]   of heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:20.800]   Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:26.660]   We are apt to shut our eyes against painful truth and listen to the song of that siren
[03:13:26.660 --> 03:13:30.300]   until she transforms us into beasts.
[03:13:30.300 --> 03:13:36.160]   Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?
[03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:42.060]   Are we disposed to being of the number of those having eyes, see not, and having ears,
[03:13:42.060 --> 03:13:47.980]   hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
[03:13:47.980 --> 03:13:54.280]   For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth,
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:59.980]   to know the worst, and to provide for it."
[03:13:59.980 --> 03:14:06.460]   So if you realized that your family and/or community was in danger, how would you make
[03:14:06.460 --> 03:14:10.260]   them aware of it, as a measure to protect them from the peril?
[03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:16.600]   Well, once you meet and surmount the mental obstacles by employing your use of reason,
[03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:22.100]   it would then be logical to organize the facts, connect and communicate with your loved ones
[03:14:22.100 --> 03:14:28.420]   and community, to learn together how to dispel confusion, how to take informed constructive
[03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:34.220]   actions, and when you meet resistance, how to learn your way forward.
[03:14:34.220 --> 03:14:39.860]   It doesn't benefit anyone to continue to sanitize the world for our youth, as it prevents
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:45.460]   them from developing a strong immune system, and thereby undermines their chances of survival
[03:14:45.460 --> 03:14:46.880]   in this world.
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:52.460]   To that end, as I mentioned in the introduction, we've also created the UltimateHistoryLesson.com
[03:14:52.460 --> 03:14:57.700]   which specifically hosts the YouTube version of this interview in video form, as well as
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:15:03.380]   the MP3 versions for your downloading pleasure, as well as the transcript, references, notes,
[03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:08.980]   links, primary source materials, and every other piece of media associated with this
[03:15:08.980 --> 03:15:13.540]   interview set, all with the goal of helping you to understand.
[03:15:13.540 --> 03:15:18.120]   And while this all might sound like a good idea, most people need a little help outgrowing
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:22.420]   the habits which enable us to be so easily manipulated.
[03:15:22.420 --> 03:15:28.300]   In order to help each and every individual tap into their internal natural resources,
[03:15:28.300 --> 03:15:33.780]   we created TragedyAndHope.com, which acts as a next step for those who seek to learn
[03:15:33.780 --> 03:15:36.720]   more after screening our productions.
[03:15:36.720 --> 03:15:41.580]   Now that you've heard John talk about the book, Tragedy and Hope, a History of the World
[03:15:41.580 --> 03:15:46.380]   and Our Time by Dr. Carol Quigley, you will indeed appreciate the fact that we've created
[03:15:46.380 --> 03:15:52.180]   an international network of independent media producers, all of whom consistently provide
[03:15:52.180 --> 03:15:59.100]   educational films, podcasts, and video reports, commercial free and free to the public.
[03:15:59.100 --> 03:16:05.020]   With over 1,400 people from all over the world posting videos, posting blogs, forming study
[03:16:05.020 --> 03:16:09.900]   and research groups, and learning the arts of intellectual self-defense and strategic
[03:16:09.900 --> 03:16:15.780]   problem solving, we have built a truly unique experience which has thus far been denied
[03:16:15.780 --> 03:16:22.840]   to the general public, and it is in every way designed to help you realize your birthright.
[03:16:22.840 --> 03:16:27.220]   In this last hour, I was surprised to learn about John's key role in helping Yoko Ono
[03:16:27.220 --> 03:16:32.540]   get approval to create Strawberry Fields, a section of Central Park in New York dedicated
[03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:39.100]   to John Lennon, across the street from where he was shot in front of the Dakota Hotel.
[03:16:39.100 --> 03:16:43.920]   We've done a lot since creating Tragedy and Hope in 2009, so let me share a bit of synchronicity
[03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:48.260]   about how all this began.
[03:16:48.260 --> 03:16:53.780]   These are the last few pages of the premier issue of our interactive magazine before it
[03:16:53.780 --> 03:16:57.860]   evolved into an interactive community of critical thinkers.
[03:16:57.860 --> 03:17:02.700]   I'd say that not only have we come a long way, but we've also stayed on track, and I
[03:17:02.700 --> 03:17:07.060]   think that's reflected in the synchronicity of these full circle moments.
[03:17:07.060 --> 03:17:12.940]   We're serious about studying the big problems, identifying the root causes, and enacting
[03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:17.020]   constructive solutions, and we sure could use your help.
[03:17:17.020 --> 03:17:22.140]   And in return, we'll help you catch up on what you've been missing.
[03:17:22.140 --> 03:17:29.220]   We must ask the questions, "Can we have peace without understanding the root causes of war?
[03:17:29.220 --> 03:17:34.860]   Can we have liberty without the responsibility and reason incorporated into our actions to
[03:17:34.860 --> 03:17:36.460]   bring it about?
[03:17:36.460 --> 03:17:39.720]   Why aren't we preparing our children for their lives?
[03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:43.500]   Why doesn't public schooling prepare us for the fact that we are entering a world where
[03:17:43.500 --> 03:17:48.900]   there are predators and systems of predation to be avoided?"
[03:17:48.900 --> 03:17:54.680]   And in learning the answers, we found that it's due to the fact that the predators designed
[03:17:54.680 --> 03:17:57.520]   the public schooling system.
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:03.000]   It's time to reclaim our birthright, and this interview is aimed at delivering it to you.
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.840]   What you do with it is your choice.
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:12.460]   Figure out how to teach yourself anything by asking substantial questions and identifying
[03:18:12.460 --> 03:18:14.320]   valid answers.
[03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:20.660]   Help us create a network of affiliates and continue to spread this message of self-liberation.
[03:18:20.660 --> 03:18:24.780]   By understanding the problems, the solutions become known.
[03:18:24.780 --> 03:18:29.800]   The truth is the future, and we want to see what the world looks like when you develop
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:33.740]   the habits which reveal your inner potential.

[03:18:41.180 --> 03:18:45.440]   Because the world is made up of words, and if you know the right words, you can make
[03:18:45.440 --> 03:18:48.520]   of the world what you will.
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:50.780]   Go and do likewise.
[03:18:50.780 --> 03:18:52.020]   Be persistent.
[03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:57.460]   Refuse to give your consent to irrationality and realize that in your heart and mind, we
[03:18:57.460 --> 03:19:03.460]   are only victims until we mature and take responsibility for our thoughts and actions.
[03:19:03.460 --> 03:19:07.660]   And to that end, keep learning, keep moving forward.
