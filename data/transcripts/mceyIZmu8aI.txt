[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   When something feels creatively right, and you're sensing it, and you're there, let's
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.400]   say in the studio, or maybe even you're listening to something that somebody sent you, how do
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.000]   you translate that, given the absence of language?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.360]   How do you translate that into a conversation with the artist?
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.480]   And again, this could be about writing, or comedy, or science, or podcasting, for that
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   matter.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.120]   How do you say that, keep going that way, when they might not even recognize that they
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   did it?
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.840]   And I'm guessing a lot of times, they don't.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.080]   Yeah, sometimes they don't.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   It depends.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:51.320]   When we're in the-- I'll try to be in a setting where, as we're talking about it, we can engage
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.040]   with it in that moment.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.360]   So it's not much good-- let's say I was producing your new record, and you played me something,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.360]   and I had some thoughts about it.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.720]   It wouldn't be so helpful for me to tell you what those were.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.520]   It'd be better for us to wait till we were in a place where we could try things and see
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400]   where it goes.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.100]   So the first thing is, I wouldn't rely on language to do it.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.520]   It would be more of making a suggestion of something that's actionable.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.880]   We try it, and then we have more data.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.920]   And either we're moving in a good direction, or we're moving away from it.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.400]   We're moving towards it or away from it, and we never know.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.440]   And so it's always an experiment.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.280]   Maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like, if I gave you two dishes of food
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360]   and asked you to taste them, and tell me which one you like better.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   Usually it's pretty straightforward.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.400]   You know when you have two choices which you like better.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.280]   And I think most creativity can be boiled down to that.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.360]   That's very different than, I wonder how this is going to perform on certain social media
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   platforms.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.720]   That's different than, what is it, when I'm tasting these two things, which is the one
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.520]   I want to finish eating.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.640]   And if I would say, I like this one better, but it needs a little salt, and then put a
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   little salt on it.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.680]   It's like, maybe I put too much salt.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   And you know when you taste it.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.680]   It's that simple.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.760]   Being in tune enough with ourselves to really know how we feel in the face of knowing that
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.520]   other people might feel very differently, which is part of the challenge.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   It's like if everyone tells you A, A, A, A, A, A, A and you listen and you're like, that's
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.120]   B.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.680]   As an artist, it's important to be able to say, to me it's B.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.120]   And it's a disconnect because so much of when we go to school, it's to get us to follow
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.040]   the rules.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.480]   And in art, it's different because the rules are there as a scaffolding to be chipped away
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.380]   as need be.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.580]   Sometimes they're helpful, sometimes they're not.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.440]   And sometimes we'll even impose our own rules to give something its shape.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.160]   So we can decide to make a, we're going to make a painting, but we're only going to use
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.360]   green and red are the only colors we're allowed to use.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.280]   We decide that in advance.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.440]   And then how do we solve the problem knowing all we have is green and red?
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.040]   You can, because otherwise if there's an infinite number of choices, anything can be anything.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.340]   You know, it's like it's sometimes more choices is not better.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.740]   So limiting your palette to something manageable forces you to solve problems in a different
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.740]   way.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:11.860]   You know, in our digital age, music wise, you can make anything digitally.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.000]   There's no like in, there was a time when if you didn't have a guitar in the studio,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.280]   you couldn't record guitar.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.760]   Or if you didn't, if you couldn't hire an orchestra, there couldn't be orchestra on
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   your recording.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.400]   Now you can just call any of those things up.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:35.000]   So there's infinite choices and infinite choices don't necessarily lead to better, better compositions
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.620]   or better final, final works, understanding how, how you feel in the face of other voices
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:57.160]   without second guessing yourself is probably the single most important thing to practice
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.000]   as an artist or skill set to develop as an artist is to know how you feel and own your
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.380]   feelings.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.820]   And the key to that is not, I know, so I know what's right for you.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.060]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.640]   It's just, I know for me.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.900]   And the reason I chose to be an artist is to demonstrate this is how I see it.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:30.560]   If I'm, if I'm undermining my taste for some commercial idea or it defeats the whole purpose
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.440]   of doing this, this is not, that's not what this process is about.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.120]   This process is I'm doing me and I'm showing you who I am and you can like it or not, but
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.040]   either way, this is still how I see it.
