[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The most fully human and complete person who ever lived was Jesus Christ. He never
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.120]   married, he was never in a romantic relationship, and never had sex. If we say
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.240]   these things are intrinsic to human fulfillment, we are calling our Savior
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.400]   subhuman. That is the voice of Sam Albury speaking before the Church of England's
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.040]   General Synod in London on February 15th, 2017. There he talked about separating
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.280]   self-identity from sexual fulfillment. It was a profound moment captured on video. Sam
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.520]   joins us today on the podcast from his office in Oxford. This video clip of your
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.200]   brief address went viral, as they say, Sam. Take us into the clip I just played.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.120]   What's the setting and what was unfolding at the moment?
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.040]   Yes, so the General Synod is the governing body of the Church of England, which is
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.000]   the kind of main Anglican denomination in England. And so it kind of acts as the
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.840]   Parliament of the Church, and so it gathers twice a year. I'm one of the
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760]   elected members on that Synod. It has a mixture of bishops, clergy, and laity.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.440]   And that particular session of Synod, we were having a debate about
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.960]   whether the Church of England should allow and accept and bless same-sex
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   partnerships and/or whether it should redefine marriage to include same-sex
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.160]   couples. So that was the context of the particular meeting. I've always known
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.240]   that the debates and the meetings at Synod are live-streamed. There are
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920]   peculiar people out there in the world who like to watch Church Synod debates
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.280]   for some reason. But I hadn't literally no idea that the words I was going to
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.560]   say in that room would be kind of extracted and put online and shared with
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.400]   other people. And to be honest, I'm really glad I didn't know that because it was
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.200]   hard enough trying to work out what to say to that room of people without
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.800]   having to think through who else might be listening in as well. So I was very
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.760]   deliberate with every sentence I spoke to kind of be speaking into a
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.640]   particular context and speaking in the light of other things that have been
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.480]   said during that Synod meeting and during that particular debate. So there
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.360]   were a bunch of bishops and clergy and kind of lay representatives there in
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.160]   that particular room. And by this stage I think we'd had about 90 minutes of
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.040]   debate. We were given a, I think, a two-minute limit on what we could say. So
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.480]   yes, it was an interesting afternoon. I had a lot of people
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.800]   praying for me, so I felt very conscious of that as I stood up to speak.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.160]   Excellent. So what was the end result of this particular debate? Well, the vote
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.280]   was specifically about whether—it all sounds very kind of mundane and
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.080]   bureaucratic—the House of Bishops in the Church of England had produced a
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.400]   report. The actual debate was on whether the Synod should recognize that report.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.840]   Got it. So we weren't actually—the conclusion of the debate wasn't going to
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.560]   be, "Shall we vote to allow same-sex marriage?" Although that was the topic,
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.760]   the vote was, "Should we recognize—not even endorse, just recognize a report that
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.920]   the bishops have produced?" We didn't, in the end, recognize the report that the
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   bishops had produced. That wasn't going to change too much of the world. But
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.880]   the significant thing was it was the first time this Synod had had an open
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.440]   debate about that issue. That makes sense. Well, that brings me to the big thing I
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.280]   want you to address today in this episode. There you were limited to two
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.720]   minutes. Here you can elaborate on this incredible point about sexual expression
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.480]   and human dignity, and the fact that I want you to unfold that point for us
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.240]   here today. Yeah, so there are a few things that are assumed, and the
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   arguments for allowing same-sex partnerships in the church or redefining
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.680]   marriage, there are a few things that keep being said in support of that that
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.200]   I very strongly disagree with. One is, you alluded to in your introduction, that
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.880]   actually sexual expression is essential to self-identity. As believers, we
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.280]   should have a problem just with the concept of self-identity. Jesus doesn't
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.440]   put the word "self" in front of identity. Jesus puts the word "self" in front of
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.240]   denial, and there's a reason for that. It's not our job to come up with our own
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.480]   identity. It's our job to learn who we are in the light of who God says we are.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.160]   So just that whole concept of self-identity, I think, is entirely
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.680]   wrong-headed from the start. I love the testimony of the Samaritan woman in John
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.880]   4 after she's met Jesus. She goes back to her town, and she says to them, "Come meet
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.680]   a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?" And I just love
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.840]   that. That's the testimony of all of us. Jesus is the one who shows us who we
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.760]   really are. So that's one thing just to say. The other thing is that the more
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.000]   significant part of this, which is the idea that you have to be sexually
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.520]   fulfilled in order to be complete as who you are. And we kept hearing in these
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.080]   discussions, and you still hear it in discussions today, that if you are not
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.000]   sexually fulfilled, you're somehow diminishing who you are. You're less
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.360]   complete. You can only be a shriveled version of who you are meant to be. And
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.280]   that is assuming a very particular anthropology, one that I think is
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.240]   massively unbiblical, because it implies that the center of our humanity, the
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.360]   center of our personhood, is our sexual feelings. That they are the core of who
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.560]   we are, and therefore they have to be expressed and fulfilled in order for us
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.040]   to be authentically us. And the point I was really trying to make is that
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.960]   Jesus challenges that. Just in the way he lived his own life, he challenges that. As
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.160]   you quoted me, Jesus is the most fully human and complete person who
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.040]   ever lived, and yet he was celibate. And so the moment we say that you have to be
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.200]   sexually fulfilled or romantically fulfilled or married in order to be a
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.520]   full human being, we are saying Jesus wasn't a full human being. And that
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.400]   insight came to me because of two things that have happened in
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.040]   previous months. The first was I was having a conversation with an
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.400]   evangelical megachurch pastor who was telling me that he was having problems
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.200]   with the traditional understanding of Christian sexual ethics because he said
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.160]   you can't make someone live without romantic hope. That's just
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.200]   not a plausible way for someone to live. And I just remember reflecting on that
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   and thinking, again, that assumes a very particular anthropology. One that
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.000]   actually doesn't apply to Jesus. And the second thing that happened was I was
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.520]   preaching through 1 John. We got to the part, I think it's in chapter 4, where
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.000]   John teaches us that if you deny that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, that is
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.480]   the spirit of the Antichrist. And I remember thinking, who does that these
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.200]   days? That was a kind of a first and second century type issue. Does anyone
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.600]   actually deny that now? And I suddenly realized, yes, this man who says you
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.000]   can't live without romantic hope is denying the full humanity of Jesus. And I
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.960]   suddenly realized that's part of what is undergirding this debate, is a
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.400]   very misleading and problematic anthropology that locates the center of
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.000]   our humanity in our sexual fulfillment. And it's actually very, very destructive.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.320]   Actually, whether you're feeling sexually fulfilled or not, it's very destructive.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.200]   If you are feeling sexually fulfilled, it's destructive because it's saying to
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.000]   you, this is as good as life gets. This is it. This is life to the full. And most
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.520]   people who have any sense of awareness will recognize that being sexually
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.880]   fulfilled doesn't make all of life suddenly feel complete. But it's
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.240]   particularly destructive to those who are not feeling sexually fulfilled,
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.640]   because it says to them that the best in life is passing you by. And my fear is
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.360]   that it's only a few short, tragic steps from someone being told that you need to
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.080]   be sexually fulfilled to be complete, for them to then hear that a life without
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.040]   sexual fulfillment isn't worth living. And it's an anthropology that has a
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.400]   body count. So I just think it's very destructive. There are a lot of people
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.840]   who are, for one reason or another, unable to marry. There are a lot of people, for
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.640]   one reason or another, who are not able to be sexually fulfilled in the way that
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.880]   they may feel they ought to be. And the message of our culture to them is, you're
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.760]   not really living. And my fear is people are going to believe that. So Jesus, just
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.120]   in his very life, challenges that. And then in his teaching, he shows us what is
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.160]   the center of our humanity. And that's the fact that we've been created for a
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.880]   relationship with our Creator. And so he tells us that he is the bread of life.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.280]   He is what our hungry souls need to be fed by. Not romantic fulfillment. That's
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.880]   not going to feed our souls. Maybe a great gift if enjoyed in the right kind
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.160]   of ways that we're told about in the Bible. But actually, if we think sexual or
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.280]   romantic fulfillment is going to make life complete, actually we're putting a
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.080]   burden on those two things they cannot possibly bear. And so, which is why
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.360]   we need to keep hearing the words of Jesus, that actually he's the bread of
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.520]   life. That we are created for a relationship with the God who made us. So
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.320]   that's kind of where I've been trying to go with that. Interestingly, one of the
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.560]   biggest bits of feedback after that speech was shared online was just a lot
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.960]   of single people, not necessarily same-sex attracted, the majority wouldn't
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.040]   have been, but just saying they felt encouraged in their singleness by those
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.480]   words. Which makes me think that actually we need to encourage our single
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.160]   friends more to realize that that's not a deficient way to live. And my
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.000]   impression is that a lot of Christians in the church who are single are made to
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.120]   feel for one reason or another as though it is a deficient way to live. So I think
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.920]   it's a big issue. I think it's a huge issue. Yeah, it's absolutely a huge issue,
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.960]   relevant to every one of us and relevant even for married couples too. Well, one of
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.000]   the things I say to some of the younger folks around is that if you marry
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.320]   someone thinking they're going to fulfill you, you're going to be a bit of
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   a nightmare to be married to. Because again, you're putting up an expectation
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.960]   and weight on the human institution of marriage that it cannot bear. Marriage is
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.280]   not meant to fulfill us, it's meant to point to the thing which does fulfill us,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.360]   which is the real marriage with Christ. Amen. Thank you, Sam. You know, one of the
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.620]   things I most appreciate about you is your frankness, which is obvious here in
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.440]   this episode, but also your ability to speak with convictional kindness. I think
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.320]   this was on full display in your Church of England Synod video, a video which can
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   be found on YouTube. And you know, it's true of your ministry outreach work on
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.280]   secular college campuses too, and when we return next time on Wednesday, I want to
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.920]   go there next. I want you to speak to Christian leaders on the front lines of
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.400]   the sexual identity conversations and culture, because I think you have a lot
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   to teach us from your personal experiences, and we'll cover that next
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   time. I'm your host, Tony Reike. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.680]   podcast with guest Sam Albury. We'll see you next time.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.340]   you
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.400]   you
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
