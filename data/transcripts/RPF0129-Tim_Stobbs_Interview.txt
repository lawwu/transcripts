[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.320]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   I'm your host.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.360]   Today is Friday, January 2, 2014.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:48.240]   The first show of the new year and I think it's appropriate that we kick off the new year with the discussion of financial independence and early retirement, one of my favorite themes.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:04.360]   Today, I'm going to share with you an interview with Tim Stobbs who is the author of a blog entitled Canadian Dream Free at 45 and then also a book with a similar name, Free at 45, of how to achieve financial independence at an early age.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:18.560]   If you are planning on enhancing your financial life here in this new year in 2015, then perhaps this is a great place for you to start by listening to someone else's comments and someone else's experiences.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.480]   This show is from a Canadian perspective but it's not intensely Canadian.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:33.760]   It's a little bit of discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing financial independence within the Canadian context versus other cultural contexts.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.560]   But the principles and ideas are indeed universally applicable.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.200]   So I hope you enjoy today's show.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.040]   Tim is a regular guy working on his goals.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.280]   Very interesting story.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.520]   It's a really great interview.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:56.200]   I will be back with you on Monday, the 5th of January, back from the holidays and I'm excited about a brand new year with all of you.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.760]   Been a lot of work over the last six months to build up the show to the point where it's been now but we're only just getting started.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:26.560]   I have an intense focus and commitment to transforming this show into a world-class financial education platform where I will, in conjunction with other great teachers, teach you everything you need to know to go from nothing to financial independence within a reasonable amount of time.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.360]   Here's the interview.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.320]   Tim, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   I appreciate you being with us today.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   No problem.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.120]   I'd love to start with your story.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.600]   So you write a blog about the Canadian dream to be free at 45.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.960]   How did you get into thinking about early retirement and planning for your own early retirement?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.120]   Erotically, that happened at just a low point at work.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.840]   What happened is I was working at a job that I actually loved.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.880]   I realized one day before going back to work and I was nearly physically ill thinking about having to go back to work.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.200]   I went, "Well, obviously this is a very crappy way to live your life so I've got to do something better than this."
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.360]   I stumbled across the idea of financial independence around that time frame of early retirement and went, "Oh, never having to work ever for anyone else."
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600]   I did really good at that point in my life.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.080]   That's where I found this whole addiction into investing in personal finance and learning more.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.680]   I really started off not owning much of anything and just picked Freedom 45 as a wild ass guess.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.880]   A few years ago, Canada had a series of very popular commercials called Freedom 55 by London Life.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.480]   I just went, "Oh, I'll take a decade off that. I'll do it earlier."
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.920]   Did you consider just getting a different job as maybe an easier way to get out of the job that you hated?
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.120]   It's kind of funny. I still ended up going on to a different job and actually enjoying that.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   It's just more than anything, I learned from that first job what I loathed about working for certain companies.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.240]   I've made the conscious decision never ever to get in that situation again.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.800]   But it seemed well still going on with the idea of financial independence anyway.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.760]   It's kind of funny to say, but in my mind it actually is an important step.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:20.680]   I love the early retirement financial independence community, but in my mind it makes a lot more sense to not start with saying,
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.160]   "How can I accumulate a million dollars so that I can be fully financially independent?"
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:34.080]   But rather to say, "How can I just start by getting there quicker by building a job or business or lifestyle that I think I would be happier with?"
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.560]   And then use that to fund my financial independence so that then I have the choice and I can find out,
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.760]   "Was I deluding myself or did I actually enjoy this job?"
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.080]   Yeah, you kind of hit on one of my things that commonly gets out of lost in the early retirement community.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.320]   We tend to focus exclusively on the numbers and almost forget about the incidental thing of,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.040]   "You should actually be happy while doing all this, otherwise what the hell is the point?"
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.760]   Right, right.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.520]   So it's kind of funny that that's why I subbed out of my blog was about the early retirement and happiness,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.880]   because I'm like, "There's no point in getting there in a rapid amount of time and then being miserable on the process to it."
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.560]   So I very much kind of delved into the psychology of happiness as well,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.320]   and simultaneously I was getting financial independence and looking at that and going,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.080]   "Well, okay, really let's build life to be better across the board now and going towards."
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.400]   What are some ways that you have done that in your life?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.960]   In particular, one of the ones I think are probably the most underutilized,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.840]   just because the corporate world doesn't seem to allow it that much, is going to work part-time.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.480]   Like right now I'm working 90% of my day job.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.080]   I don't work full-time anymore.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.960]   I haven't for... I've dabbled in and out of that lower percentages of 80 or 90% for a couple of years now,
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.160]   and I find it makes a huge difference to quality of life and satisfaction.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.680]   My joke with some people is I don't hate work, so to speak, which is kind of funny for an early retirement blogger,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.880]   but I just hate working full-time.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.760]   Right, right.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   Is that an official, legislated thing in Canada where you can choose,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.640]   "Oh, I just want to work 90% time"? It sounds fairly official.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.440]   It's not really official. It's actually relatively hard to get your hands on it.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.400]   In my company, I found out that one of the first guys ever to do this,
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.760]   other than for maternity kind of type of benefits for the policy used,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.960]   was only maybe five years ago when that first happened.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.120]   So, generally speaking, it's a relatively new development for a lot of corporations to allow it.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.880]   Our company's had a policy in the books for eight years or so to allow it in theory,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.240]   but very, very few people get it approved.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   Interesting. You are right.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.160]   Even in the US, what is more common, if you're working for a large company,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.120]   as many large companies, will allow you to work a four-day-per-week, ten-hour-per-day schedule
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.400]   instead of the five-day-per-week, eight-hour schedule.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.320]   In my mind, if I were in a job or business that permitted that,
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.240]   I would do that in a heartbeat just to compress the amount of time working.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.200]   I've actually seen multiple people do that here, too.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   In Saskatchewan, where I live here, it's relatively recently been written into labor law
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   to allow that to happen before it was off the books for a lot of people doing it.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.440]   It's cropping up here and there. It just depends on the business somewhat,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.680]   whether it aligns to letting that work or not.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.720]   I've had a few friends over the years who've done that kind of compressed work week thing
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.440]   and wouldn't trade it for one world. They love it.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.560]   Very similarly speaking, for my case, my reduced hours works out to every other Friday off.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.880]   So what happens is I work one full week and the next week I take that Friday off.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.960]   I mean, there's multiple advantages to it.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.760]   First, you have entire days cleared of your normal day-to-day commitments,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.240]   but not necessarily planned to be fun days.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   So if every Saturday is a fun day with your family and you have every other Friday off,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.640]   that gives you a whole day when most of the world is in that work week schedule.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   So you can easily use that day as a focus.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.160]   But then it also perhaps allows you to avoid the rush and crush.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.360]   Every two weeks I have to go out during rush hour to go to a meeting that's down south of where I live,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.080]   down in Boca Raton. I have to drive during rush hour.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.680]   I sit there in traffic on I-95 saying, "Why does anybody do this?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.200]   Why on earth do you sit in traffic at this horrific time of day with everybody else?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.080]   Why don't you go into work at 5 a.m. or at 11 a.m. and work on some kind of off-peak hours just to avoid this?"
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.280]   It's funny, actually, that's coming up more and more as people are starting to realize,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.640]   or at least some workplaces are letting you tweak things a little bit.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.400]   Another thing they've let us do at our workplace,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.040]   I actually start work half an hour early for the express reason.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.760]   I live in a smaller city where there's really not much traffic.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.320]   Honestly, I can get anywhere in town in about 15 minutes.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.120]   I still hate traffic.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.480]   For me, it's the most wasteless, pointless thing in the entire cosmos.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.240]   I purposely start work a little bit earlier and get out of work a little bit earlier for the
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.040]   express reason to avoid our mini-traffic jam we have here.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.280]   How did you come across the idea of being financially independent?
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.480]   Was it something you read online, a family member who was doing it?
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.920]   How did you first come up with the idea?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.560]   I think I just came across a blog or something.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.800]   I can't even remember what. This is over six years ago,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.120]   so it's going to be fuzzy in my memory a little bit of what happened exactly.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.200]   Just came across a reference to it and went, "Wow, that sounded pretty good,"
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.160]   and then looked into it and realized that, shockingly enough,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   that I was an engineer making fairly good money that you just run the math and go,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.080]   "Oh, I'm not that far off of a relatively early retirement.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.040]   A little bit of planning here."
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   I started iteratively getting into realizing how the numbers work
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.080]   and learning a bit more about that as it went along.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.480]   When you picked the date of being free at 45, how many years from 45 were you?
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.880]   About 15 at the time.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.640]   Okay. Are you on track for that?
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.480]   Actually, it's been steadily reducing since then.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.120]   My last iteration, I'm just writing a series of posts now
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   where I'm going to try to make a run for it at 40.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.400]   Good for you.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.040]   I'm 36 right now, so another four years, give or take.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.160]   Good for you. What are you going to do with your time?
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.200]   Big one is I love writing.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.920]   Actually, it's funny.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.840]   I wrote a post on this a number of years ago about selling out your dreams
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.280]   and then buying them back afterwards.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.320]   I always loved writing, but I was acutely aware in Canada
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.480]   that most writers make next to no income, so it's a good way to slowly starve to death.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.680]   So I went, "No, I'm not really interested in that."
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.480]   So I went with my father, who was an engineer at the time,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.880]   and talking to the idea of, "Well, I'm good at math and science.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   Why don't I do engineering instead?"
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.360]   So I went, "Okay, great."
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   So I went and did engineering and got a degree, got a good job,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.840]   made some good money, and still kept my hobby of writing.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.520]   But I've just decided that, you know what?
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.400]   I like writing more than I like engineering by a long shot,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.320]   so I'm just working towards flipping careers, basically, in the long run here.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.200]   It's to be able to quit my job, not necessarily to make anything
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.440]   a side job in the long run, and just enjoy writing because I actually enjoy writing.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   Have you made any money from your writing?
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.280]   A little bit over the years.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:03.920]   It's kind of funny.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.600]   I wasn't really planning on it.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.720]   It's one of those hobbies you just sort of start because you're interested in doing it.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.800]   The blog was kind of almost a pointed thing I started just to
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   have a conversation with people about, "I'm thinking this on my way off base,"
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.680]   or helping other people out and learning a little bit about it as it went.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.760]   And that led to several other opportunities.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.320]   I did some freelance articles for the Toronto Star,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.040]   and then I self-published my own book,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   which all in all actually did make me a lot of money,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.320]   but it made me a little extra money,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.120]   which is kind of a nice little bonus for a hobby that I do it because I enjoy it.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.360]   How else has the blog served you?
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.560]   I've recommended to many people that they keep a blog,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.480]   but I'm interested in hearing how it has helped you or hurt you over the years.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.800]   I think most of all it's helped me with regards of my own accountability.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.920]   When I write something down or think things through,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.760]   I'm very much one of those people that think better with talking it through with people.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.160]   So I tend to find the blog is an excellent way to throw random ideas out and have people
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.720]   give me some feedback on what worked for them or not worked, and help iteratively learn better
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.240]   how to do my own plans.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.400]   For example, I've done my retirement calculation series a number of times over the years,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.360]   and iteratively it gets a little bit better every time I do the calculation set.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.440]   Just basically feedback from people, "Well, have you thought about this?
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.480]   Or have you included that?"
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.920]   And I went, "Oh, that's a good point," or "Maybe we should include a factor for this."
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.000]   And so it's gotten a little bit more complicated, which is a bit of a downside,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.400]   but I think it's a more accurate projection as I've gotten along.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.800]   Do you not feel a little bit strange about telling everyone how much money you have?
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.360]   Not really.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.280]   I've got this real bizarre thing of...
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.480]   I work for a crown corporation up here in Canada.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.280]   So the reality is what I make every year is actually published in an annual report
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.600]   because I make over the $50,000 threshold.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   So I've been known...
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.880]   Like, publicly, you can research how much I make down to the last dime.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.000]   Wow.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.960]   For years.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.320]   So it's one of those bizarre...
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   I've already had public disclosure on that.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.360]   So I'm like, "Really?
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   Your net worth after your income is already posted online is really not much more of a
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.840]   step forward."
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.120]   What kind of corporation did you say that was?
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.080]   A crown corporation.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.720]   What does that mean?
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.440]   It's a corporation run by the government for the benefit of the people of the province.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.920]   For example, Saskatchewan is a relatively small jurisdiction,
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.280]   so it doesn't really pay to have multiple power companies trying to produce power in
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.240]   the same jurisdiction.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.360]   So what they did is just created a power company that runs it for them.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.880]   Got it.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.440]   Understood.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:37.440]   What is your strategy with regard to how you are planning to fund retirement?
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.280]   Are you investing in stocks?
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.320]   Are you buying real estate?
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.680]   Are you building up businesses?
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.400]   What's your plan?
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.560]   Mine predominantly is more on the investment side of the house.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.360]   While I like real estate, we're currently in a bit of an acid bubble here in Canada
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.400]   with most of our real estate.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.320]   So I'm kind of avoiding that in the short term.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.560]   Actually, it was very shocking the other day.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.200]   The Bank of Canada governor came out here and said that overall they estimate the market's
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.000]   overvalued anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, depending where you live, which is kind of
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.760]   they've been silent on the issue for a number of years.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.240]   So I kind of avoided that in the short term here.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.920]   I might get into it a little bit later.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.840]   But more realistically, I'm going with investments.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.600]   And there's a combination of various things.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.800]   I mean, exchange-traded funds are tax-sheltered accounts.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.000]   Just a simple couch potato portfolio, as per Dan.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.320]   Which I believe you interviewed just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.720]   I did.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.920]   He was my first Canadian financial advisor I ever talked to.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.480]   Yes, I did.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.800]   Yeah, I kind of like Dan's portfolio approach quite a bit.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.320]   So I kind of mirrored my savings off that.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.600]   Then my work has a relatively good pension plan that's got really low fees in it.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.200]   So I invest in that.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.560]   And then finally, we have our tax-free savings accounts, where I put in our individual stock
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.920]   picks into those.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.800]   Interesting.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   So the tax-free savings accounts, explain again how those work.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.560]   How do they work within the context of early retirement planning?
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.080]   Well, tax-free savings accounts kind of are similar to your guys' Roth IRA accounts in
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.520]   broad terms.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.960]   I think the biggest difference is the fact that everyone's familiar with the concept.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.480]   You can put the money in, it grows tax-free, and then you can take it out tax-free in the
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.440]   tail end.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.360]   In Canada, though, when they actually created these accounts, they did it a step further,
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.800]   so to speak, than your guys.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.000]   There is no retirement thing attached to it.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.120]   It's basically you can use it as much as you want at any point in your life to save
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.200]   for anything, theoretically.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.120]   So a lot of people have been using it for house down payments or saving for vacations
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.000]   or absolutely anything and everything is possible with it.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.280]   But a lot of times, because of the tax-free savings account, which I think is the biggest
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.160]   misnomer the government ever did on this thing, people use it as just a plain savings account.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.480]   So their tax savings is very peonically small because they're not really saving much money
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.600]   on it.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.720]   It's a shocking thing to me.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.160]   I talk to people here and they don't really realize you can hold stocks in these accounts
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.960]   and the growth on that is significantly better than what you get with just sheltering your
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.160]   measly 1% savings.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.000]   Steve Kerr (00:10:00): People don't use it.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.600]   I mean, buying stocks is not common in an account like that?
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.040]   David Gardner (00:10:04): Not up here.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.360]   They haven't wrapped their heads around it for whatever reason.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.400]   I just don't get it.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.040]   Like I said, I think it's almost the naming convention thing where people don't realize
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.560]   that, yeah, it could be a savings account, but it can be a lot more than that.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.200]   And so me and my wife have both done that.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.560]   In our case, our account performance has been substantially better than the average person.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.400]   Now you can put around $25,000 in per person.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.440]   It's a set amount you're allowed a contribution from every year, about 5,500 is the current
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.480]   uptick every year.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.160]   So combined, we should have only about $50,000 in contributions, but combined value of our
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.080]   accounts is pushing almost 95,000.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.960]   Steve Kerr (00:10:42): And you can take it out, including the interest
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.920]   and the gain, you can take it out at any time.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.280]   There are no age restrictions.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.960]   David Gardner (00:10:48): None whatsoever.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.720]   So that's kind of the ultimate early retirement savings vehicle.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.000]   Canadians are sitting on, but we don't utilize as much as we should.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.680]   It's really, really ironic.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.880]   Steve Kerr (00:10:56): That is insane.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.080]   David Gardner (00:10:58): I know.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.280]   Steve Kerr (00:11:01): I mean, you guys have such what I consider
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.040]   to be an exorbitant tax rate.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.760]   Why would anybody ever invest outside of an account like that?
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.040]   If you can shelter all your capital gains, you can shelter all your income taxes.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.760]   It sounds like I'm speechless.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.400]   David Gardner (00:11:19): No, I agree with you.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.360]   It's one of those things.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.040]   What's interesting though is the competing one is that people are used to their registered
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.440]   savings plans, their RSPs here, which are more like your guys' 401ks.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.240]   So what they do is they contribute to those and get a tax refund back.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.160]   So because as you've mentioned, our taxes are quite high, that's a pretty good chunk
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   of change when you put money into those.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.960]   So people are kind of used to that as being, "Oh, look, I put money in here and I get a
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.160]   good tax refund back."
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.480]   But then ignore the fact in the longer term, those accounts, you eventually get taxed when
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.920]   you take the money out on the tail end.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.320]   It's tax deferment.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.360]   It's not tax avoidance.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.400]   Steve Morrison (00:11:56): But can't you do both?
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.160]   David Gardner (00:12:00): Well, yeah, you can do both.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.880]   And the one's based on your percentage of income, your RSPs.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.480]   So what happens is that one scales up.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.880]   And so you'll probably, the average person that's allowed 18% of last year's income
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.480]   goes into your RSP accounts at your limit, while the TFSA accounts are flat rate, regardless
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.160]   of how much income you make.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.000]   So your TFSA, while longer term, younger people can use that to finance their whole retirement.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.520]   The reality is if you're towards the tail end of your working career, you will not be
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.960]   able to shelter enough money in there to make a huge dent in your retirement savings.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.680]   So it's a bit of a generational problem.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.200]   What the older folks aren't used to using it and the younger folks don't really realize
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.400]   what it can do in the long run.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.960]   Steve Morrison (00:12:37): Wow.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.360]   Can you own alternative investments?
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.600]   Could you purchase real estate within the account?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.800]   Can you purchase some various types of alternative investments?
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.680]   Do you have any idea?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.720]   David Tenenbaum (00:12:50): There is a degree of latitude with that.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.040]   I mean, you wouldn't be able to buy real estate directly.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.160]   You wouldn't be able to theoretically hold a mortgage in your RSP.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.200]   And I believe that would be technically possible in TFSA.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.360]   But of course, the average person right now doesn't have enough money to do that in those
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.000]   accounts yet.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.440]   Steve Morrison (00:13:02): Interesting.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.640]   Do you teach people in your book?
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.080]   Is your book focused on just telling your story or are you trying to teach people how
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.840]   to become financially independent within a Canadian context?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.040]   David Tenenbaum (00:13:16): I was more about teaching people how to be
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.320]   financially independent.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.240]   I do touch a little bit on some of the motivation, like my story there of hitting my job is really
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.160]   the start of the book and kind of touch on that.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.080]   But I don't get into too much on the investment side of the house.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.840]   I kind of touch on those relatively lightly other than some broad contextual pieces people
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.440]   need to understand about their account types and what they can do in broad strokes.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.680]   But it's more about the whole process of how do you plan and then how you would run through
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.560]   a series of calculations of estimating whether you're close or not, and then simultaneously
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.320]   weaving that through with how the heck do you get yourself more happy while doing all
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:08.560]   this?
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.920]   I find it very shocking the average person who blows their job as much as they do in
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.320]   North America and doesn't do anything about it.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.240]   It just blows my mind the number of unhappy people I meet in the office.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.560]   I'm like, "Why are you even working here if you're this unhappy?
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.360]   Seriously, folks."
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.320]   (Laughter)
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.160]   Dave: When you talk about happiness and as you studied happiness, what ideas and techniques
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.800]   do you teach people to build a happier life?
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.760]   Matthew: I think the biggest one is we've got to get off this consumer train wreck that
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.920]   we all decided is this constant upgrade or buy or better or next thing and realize we
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.200]   are sitting in the top tier of world standard of living.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.160]   Look around people.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.760]   Everything around you is awesome, so why the hell are you not enjoying it a little bit?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.480]   Stop asking for the next iPhone.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.680]   Instead, maybe go, "Oh, you know what?
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   Realistically speaking, the iPhone 4 to iPhone 6 has almost no feature differences."
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.880]   (Laughter)
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.720]   It's okay to have your old phone.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.520]   It will not kill you.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.560]   Dave: Right.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.080]   Do you have any idea why that happened?
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.560]   Do you have a perspective as far as a society-wide perspective?
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.120]   Matthew: I think what ends up happening is a very easy thing to do is we don't give
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.520]   ourselves permission to actually explore what our spending means for us.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.760]   We tend to follow the crowd or default think.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.680]   When everyone else is doing it, it's so easy to follow along with the concept.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.440]   Regardless of the fact that everyone else really isn't happy anyway doing it, it's
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.800]   one of those terribly erotic things.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   We almost don't give ourselves permission to just think outside of the box and customize
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.920]   our spending to what we personally need, not rather than what we think we need based on
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.480]   our soul.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.440]   Actually, that's one of the core stones of my happiness side of the house is to reduce
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.720]   your spending is really just look at what your spending is and then optimize it towards
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.080]   your personal preferences.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.760]   For example, one of my classic things is I say, "I don't like my power bill.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   I get really no joy in paying it off every month, so I've lowered my consumption of
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:11.200]   power and free up cash flow to do other things like, 'Oh, I like to go out with my family
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.120]   and do things, so I'm going to spend less money on my power bill and free up more money
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.680]   to go swimming with my family or go ice skating with them or whatever else that feels interesting
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.200]   or will help us out being a more happy family together."
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.520]   What are the most frequently asked questions that you've gotten from your readers?
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   Beyond the disbelief of it's even possible to retire that early in Canada.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.000]   [laughs]
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.680]   That tends to be the most common one.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.200]   After that, it's a bit of a hit and miss spread of questions.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.960]   It always surprises me the intelligence of the average reader out there in blogs in general
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.040]   because I get all sorts of questions that just astound me once in a while for the level
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:01.200]   of detail and realizing that I tend to write at a probably middle range viewpoint of not
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.120]   overly technical, but I wrote this while I was the odd person commenting something that's
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.480]   extremely detail-oriented.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.720]   The other day, I was talking about the 4% withdrawal rule and one fellow sent me a question
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.000]   on that asking a little more in-depth detail about the fees involved in your investing
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.440]   and how that drastically changed the results of whether you could use that rule or not.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.200]   I thought, "Well, good for you.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.920]   You've actually read that study to realize that point."
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.400]   [laughs]
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:28.640]   Right.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   When you say disbelief, I want to go back to that.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.440]   Is that the most frequently asked question that you get?
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.280]   People say, "How is this even possible?"
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.520]   I think that tends to happen a lot because a lot of people don't understand that it's
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.760]   entirely possible to restructure your spending and be very happy with it.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.880]   For example, we spend probably about a little less than $30,000 a year on everything, but
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.240]   the thing is I have a paid-off house.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:57.520]   Reality is it's pretty cheap to live if your basic happiness is reading books from
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.880]   the library and going to the odd movie now and again.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.800]   Right.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.720]   I have certainly seen that myself.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.680]   What's interesting is if you can—I don't know how to teach this.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:19.360]   I personally think that we are conditioned into group think where we don't look to
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.840]   understand who we are and we don't necessarily look to understand what's important to us.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.160]   There are many effects of that.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.800]   One of those effects it makes for an easily governed population.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.160]   One of those effects it makes for an easily marketed to population.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.080]   You got to find the little niches for your product, but it seems much easier to market
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.640]   to a homogenous group than to not.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.280]   But it's so easy to simply just step out and—well, maybe it's not easy.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.120]   It's relatively simple.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.240]   If you can step out just to simply actually look at your needs and recognize, as you said,
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.800]   we live—everyone listening to my voice—we live in some of the most prosperous nations
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   in the world where in a world where the average person lives on, what, a few dollars a day
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.560]   and most of us have hundreds and thousands of dollars available every day, every week,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.960]   every month, it seems absurd that we can't build a beautiful life that's run a little
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.920]   bit more efficiently.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.960]   But in order to do that, you have to get free of the cycle of essentially impressing others
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.360]   and have to get free of the cycle of fitting in.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.520]   That's not easy to do for many people.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.280]   - Well, the reality is, too, what tends to happen, I think, is a little bit of your personality
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:33.680]   makeup.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.560]   There's been a broad theme of—you read some of the early retirement forums here and
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.320]   there on various things, and you come to the broad conclusion that there's almost a personality
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.160]   type that tends to go with it, that people who are going after their retirement tend
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.960]   to be the ones that value their independence over everything else.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:55.520]   And so we tend to structure our lives, be willing to be different because we value that
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.200]   independence, and some other people aren't prepared to do that in broad strokes.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.680]   So, for example, my wife and me have completely different viewpoints on this whole idea of
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.560]   early retirement.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   I'm going after it from an independence of determining my own faith point of view.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.360]   She loves the idea from a completely different point of view.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.880]   She loves the security aspect.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.160]   For her, there's nothing better than knowing the fridge breaks, that she can tomorrow go
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.440]   buy a new one, slap it on the credit card, and pay it off at the end of the month, and
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.000]   no problem.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.080]   So it's finding those different motivations for everybody and then realizing that that's
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.200]   how you start things.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.920]   And I agree with you, we tend to do a lot of groupthink, and that's almost a byproduct
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.880]   of an earlier age where you tended to have very homogenous media coverage of things.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.400]   Nowadays, with niche blogs and podcasts and such things like that, it's very easy to get
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.640]   a more alternative point of view out there on stuff.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.680]   The issue is, it's realizing a lot of people are still not mentally prepared to make that
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.680]   leap in their heads of going, "It's okay not to be like everyone else.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   We spend our early childhood trying to conform in school, and then trying to break out of
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:26:59.920]   it.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.600]   It's really kind of ironic."
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.880]   I joke with some people here that our education system keeps saying its objective is to create
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.640]   critical thinkers, but then they quash that in their little formality of how they process
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.920]   them through their grades.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.440]   So it's one of those terrible ironies.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.600]   We have this desire to be critical thinkers, which we mean actually talking back to the
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.880]   teacher now and again.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.120]   Right.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.680]   The audience is expecting me to jump on that theme and talk for about 15 minutes because
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:34.400]   that's a huge, huge deal for me, but I'm actually going to step right past it and go on.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.360]   Good for you.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:41.120]   Go on from it because I've preached far too much on that theme.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.960]   I'm interested in your developing thought process and then your wife's developing thought
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   process.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.920]   Did you come across the idea of early retirement and then present it to her?
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.840]   Did she come across it concurrently?
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.800]   How did you learn to work together toward the same goal?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.560]   And I guess the pre-question to that was, do you share the same goal of early retirement?
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.480]   If so, how did you work together to get there?
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.560]   Actually, it's kind of funny.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.600]   My wife and me started off in totally different tangents here.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.800]   I explained my hobby and stuff, and she went, "Well, okay, is this affecting how we're doing
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.600]   our current life?"
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.000]   No.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.720]   "Okay, don't care.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.120]   Go ahead.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.680]   Have fun, dear."
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.120]   She ignored it really for the first several years entirely.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.800]   It's only after a while she actually started reading my own blog and going, "Oh, I just
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.680]   really want to figure out what's going through your head a little bit more on some of this
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.800]   stuff because they talk about odd things here and there and she'd be confused," or something
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.440]   like that.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.680]   So she started reading the blog purely to understand where my headspace was at to save
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.280]   on time on conversations later on.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.560]   Then she kind of stumbled across the idea that from her point of view, she really doesn't
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.440]   care about your whole early retirement plan.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.480]   She wanted it from a different angle of wanting that security aspect.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.280]   After she realized that, she also realized something else too, that she has a different
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.080]   viewpoint of me.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.000]   Like, I don't mind some work.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.400]   I actually enjoy writing, so I plan to do some of that when I'm, so to speak, retired
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.760]   from my day job.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.400]   She's got a different viewpoint if she doesn't want to do that.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.240]   She's in a very much enviable spot.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.840]   She runs her own daycare business in the house right now and basically hires and fires clients
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.160]   that she wants and does it because she enjoys the job, not because she needs the money.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.440]   So she's pretty much in an ideal headspace already.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.160]   So on the career front, she's ahead of me and by virtue of that fact, she has no desire
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.480]   to necessarily stop working at the same time I do.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.760]   She'll probably keep working for several years after the fact and just slowly scale
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.400]   out.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.920]   One of the ideas she's batting around in her head is to just switch to doing school
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.360]   age children only.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.880]   So she'd do a little bit of care and mourning, have most of the day free, a little bit of
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.080]   care in the late afternoon, evening and then be done for the day.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.840]   And from that point of view, she's willing to work quite a bit longer than me and then
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.240]   come back through later on and then stop entirely.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.560]   Do you guys have kids?
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.320]   Yeah, two boys.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.200]   How old are your kids?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.040]   The oldest one is almost 10, the youngest one is 6.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:12.400]   So with regard to your, I guess, financial independence date, you said you're, how many
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   years do you anticipate longer until you are financially independent currently?
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.160]   About four more years.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   Okay, so at that point in time, then I guess your boys will be 14 and 10, if all goes as
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.640]   planned.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:31.840]   Have you thought, do you worry about being financially independent at a time when they're
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.160]   essentially setting up their own independence?
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.880]   Have you thought about doing something different so that you can spend more time with them
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.680]   at a younger age?
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.880]   Well, actually, this is one of those things of it, there's never a right answer, I think.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.960]   And you always torture yourself with having better scenarios that I could have done more
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.280]   time with them younger or something else.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.920]   I very much enjoy my 90% time right now because what I do is I load up those days where I'm
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.480]   off with stuff and errands I need to do.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.280]   And so our weekends are largely free to spend with the children then.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.640]   So I've kind of done, structured that to help on that front.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.600]   But my more concerning thing with my kids is a little bit of educating them a little
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.760]   bit about preparing them for when daddy stops going to work every day.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.840]   And it's going to be an interesting shift to have them wrap their heads around the fact
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.560]   of explaining, no, you're, we're not rich, daddy and mommy are, you're not.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:30.480]   And ramming that home in their heads.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.120]   Because one of the things me and my wife wanted to do is we both didn't get much financial
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.880]   support through our education.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.840]   Like my parents paid for about a year and a half of my university, then switched me
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.880]   over to a line of credit.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.240]   And she took student loans out for the entire time she was in school.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:49.360]   And we both decided we wanted to help with our kids' education, but we weren't willing
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.800]   to sacrifice everything, everything, everything for it.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.640]   So for example, I have no delusions that my children are going to Harvard.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.720]   If they do decide to go that route, that's fine.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.360]   I've got some money saved for you, but I have no intention of paying for a ludicrously
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.480]   elite school because you decided you want to go for it.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.060]   Right.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:12.640]   So we've been keeping some money taxed aside for them for educational purposes, and they're
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.120]   kind of aiming about $80,000 in total.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.760]   So about $40,000 per kid to be sort of their setup money in their lives to help them get
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.560]   started.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.040]   Primarily for education, but realistically speaking, if they don't decide to pursue higher
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.560]   education, that will take it out and use it for other things.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   What's the college environment in Canada like?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.560]   Is it, is it important?
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.960]   Is it societally important to have a college degree in the job market?
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:45.680]   There's probably more acceptance of alternative kind of things nowadays.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.400]   We've gone through a lot of changes in the last few years.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.240]   It used to be almost assumed for a lot of people that you should go get a university
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.440]   degree, and that was important.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.720]   But what's happened nowadays is realizing that with oil and gas development in Alberta
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.080]   and other areas of the country, that trades can do very, very well as well.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.960]   So there's been a lot more push to diversify education, even down to the high school level
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.040]   now, of accepting the fact that trades are a very viable option for a career for kids
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.160]   going forward.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.720]   So I wouldn't hesitate for either one of my kids if they decided to go that route,
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.560]   because if your talents lie more in your hands, why shouldn't you do something you enjoy
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.960]   and you still get paid relatively well to do?
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:31.680]   How are you planning to teach your children about setting up their financial plans?
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.360]   What percentage of your income you're going to train them to save, things like that?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.240]   What are your plans for teaching and training them to handle money?
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.160]   Well, we're very much keeping it in a sort of a staged approach.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.920]   I'm not going to really teach them the more advanced stuff until a little bit later on.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.080]   Right now, what we've done is started them both on an allowance system early and teach
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.400]   them the whole concept of delay gratification.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.800]   I was really happy with them the other day of last year or so.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.080]   They started saving because they owned this big Lego police station.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.760]   It was expensive, like over $100, and they were really pumped and wanted to do it.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.440]   And we kind of suggested, well, if you guys buy it together, you could get it for sooner.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.960]   But oh, that's a great idea.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.720]   So they figured they could share it.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.200]   And then they started talking to some other people and various grandparents and stuff
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.800]   and telling them they were saving money for it.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.920]   And they saved their gift cards from Christmas for it and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.600]   And then, lo and behold, they actually built up enough money to actually buy the thing
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.240]   themselves.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.920]   So I was really, really impressed with them that they literally saved for like four or
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.880]   five months straight to buy this police station.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.560]   That's really great.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.080]   That's totally-- I mean, all the studies always go back to the famous marshmallow experiment.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.960]   It's been done in various permutations.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:49.520]   But if there's any one habit or character trait that seems to underpin those who are
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.040]   either financially successful or successful as measured in other metrics, be that career
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.000]   advancement, other metrics, it seems to be the ability to delay gratification and to
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.320]   do the work now and enjoy the benefit down the road.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.600]   Oh, no.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.640]   And that's one of the key things.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.880]   And so realistically, that's what the whole allowance system was about, is giving them
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:16.800]   enough money to buy or do certain things, learn from their own mistakes, do silly things
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.440]   with their money.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.960]   Let's get it out and get it over with.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.840]   I'd rather you flop in your face when you're eight years old than trying to do it when
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.600]   you're 25 and starting out in life.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.040]   So it's kind of a safer learning environment to do it this way.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.240]   I laughed.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.680]   My youngest son actually was enamored with the vending machine swimming pool the longest
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.080]   time.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.440]   We explained, well, if you really want a pop, bring your allowance money.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.400]   You can buy your own pop.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.120]   It's your allowance.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.640]   You can do what you want with it.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.960]   So he did that, and he was very proud of it and everything else.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.280]   And then he realized, he's like, well, we have pop at home.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.160]   So why don't I just pay all my money for pop?
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.680]   I've got a pop of what?
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.880]   It was really funny to see the lights go off in his head and go, this didn't turn out
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.360]   that well.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.000]   [laughs]
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.800]   Kyle: Isn't it interesting how you have to set up opportunities and permit failure?
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.480]   And hopefully you can do it at times when failure is not catastrophic.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.240]   But what a valuable way to spend a couple bucks on a pop at a vending machine so that
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.400]   you can learn the lesson associated with it later on down the road.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.600]   Matt: Well, that's an interesting thing.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.800]   I think as much as people give video games a bad habit, I think it teaches one kid something
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.040]   very, very important that I didn't really have a lot growing up, is that it's okay to
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.680]   fail.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.720]   Like, honestly, we get so worked up making sure it succeeds in everything that we kind
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.600]   of step back and don't realize it's okay to screw up.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.520]   It's bloody well useful.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.160]   I have made so many errors in my life over the years on various things that it's just
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.240]   amazing to me to realize that, you know what, we don't give enough credit for failure.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.560]   It's okay for you to go through life and go, "Hmm, I got out of university and thought
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.440]   I was entitled to a car," because this is what you do when you're a graduate.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.440]   "So I bought my first new car out of university.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.280]   Did I need to buy a new car?
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.240]   No.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.160]   Was it probably the best decision of my life?
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.360]   Not really, because I signed up for lease and large payments and everything else."
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.560]   And it was like, "But I had a career and I thought I deserved it."
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.280]   So it's like, well, I learned that in my early 20s.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.080]   If they can learn that a little closer to 15, they're light years ahead of me.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.480]   One of the most frustrating pieces of advice that I used to read is when people would say,
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.600]   "Get busy failing."
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.080]   If you read business leaders, they'll often say, "The more you fail, the better it is."
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.680]   And that's always been frustrating to me because nobody wants to fail.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:40.720]   But I'm starting as I grow and as I mature as a person, I'm starting to see the value
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.680]   of failure and starting to see it for myself as I watch, especially in my work in the past
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:53.440]   as a financial planner, that has given me a unique insight into situations.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.000]   And many times I've had a client that will talk with me and they'll talk with me and
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.360]   they'll say, "I'm going to do this.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.640]   I'm going to do this.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.920]   I'm going to do this.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.280]   I'm going to do this."
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.600]   And year after year after year, they still haven't done it.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.720]   And the reality was it would have been better if they'd said, "I'm going to do this.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.680]   Okay, did you think about it?
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.880]   Did you think carefully?
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.400]   Are you willing to accept the downsides?
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:14.720]   Yes.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.280]   Okay, go."
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.040]   And then it fails.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.880]   And then they go do something else.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   And by the time we got to the third or fourth year, they would have failed at two or three
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.240]   things and probably found something that actually worked that they couldn't see behind it.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.400]   But since they're still stuck in a system sometimes of, "I'm going to do this.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.040]   I'm going to do this.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.480]   I'm going to do this," they never get a chance to get started and figure it out as
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.200]   they go along.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.160]   And this is a current obsession of mine of how can we make failure okay?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   How can we encourage failure?
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:52.320]   How can we build it and plan for it so that you can learn to deal with failure?
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.520]   Because if you look around from a financial perspective, if you look at business people,
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.640]   the average business owner who is wealthy has had some failed businesses.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.800]   But for people who have never run a business and have never failed at a business, have
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:12.080]   never gone bankrupt, if you look at them, they often have this fear of failing.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.240]   But if you look at those who have massive businesses, I think of many times some of
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.640]   the people who have empires.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.840]   The three that come to mind are Richard Branson, Donald Trump, and Warren Buffett.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:29.360]   Richard Branson, I can't put my finger on which of his companies have failed, but I'm
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.320]   certain that several of his companies have failed and have gone through bankruptcy.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.240]   Donald Trump, his casinos right now are in bankruptcy and going through that.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:45.680]   Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway, the flagship company was a completely utterly failed investment
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.600]   that because he failed with the textile factory that was Berkshire Hathaway, turned it into
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.080]   a holding company.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.440]   So in my mind, like you said, this is why school and education is such a big deal to
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:02.600]   me, we shouldn't be praising, I mean we should be praising effort, not necessarily results.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.340]   And we should be encouraging failure because that's when the envelope is pushed.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.680]   And it's a totally different mindset than we have culturally right now.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.360]   No, I agree.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.720]   It's really interesting to watch my own kids grow up and develop and learn things.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.360]   They are a little bit more comfortable with failure than I would say I ever was.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.560]   And I had to kind of evolve into it.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:28.720]   I was a strong introvert growing up, so to me, talking to people was just sort of a "huh."
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   And now I sit here and I've done umpteen different media interviews and such things after my
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   book came out.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.400]   I kind of laughed, it was terribly ironic that I ended up on the national newscast here
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.240]   a couple years back after my book came out.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   So people were like, "Oh, I saw you on the news, blah blah blah."
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.280]   And I was like, "Yeah, it was a three hour afternoon, longest interview of my entire
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   life.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.680]   I was exhausted by the end of it."
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.840]   But it turned into a great little piece of inspiring people how to actually go about
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   retirement planning.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   Right.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's interesting, I look at even my life, and we're just hitting on a theme that for
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.360]   me is important, and especially important for early retirees, because you know what?
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.680]   You might fail in your retirement plan.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.600]   Maybe your spouse gets sick and you have hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills that
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.660]   aren't covered by your insurance.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.880]   And so therefore your retirement plan is staved off for longer.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.800]   But you might fail at anything.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.920]   But if the fear of failure holds you off, I think in college, I was so scared of getting
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.920]   bad grades.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.140]   I always got good grades.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:33.440]   But in college, looking back now, in order to maintain a high GPA and getting good grades,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:39.360]   I wasted so many opportunities to take classes that I was interested in, but I didn't want
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.580]   to take them and get bad grades and mess up my GPA.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.540]   So I took classes that I was good at.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.440]   And looking back on it now, I think, "I was an idiot.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.360]   How cool would it have been if I had taken all these different classes?
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.640]   And who cares about the failure?
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.800]   I'm paying for it.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.040]   I don't care.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:42:02.240]   I don't have to meet society's expectations to be able to put a 3.89 GPA on my resume.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.600]   Like why not?
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.640]   Where else in life does somebody have the opportunity to explore the things that they
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.080]   may or may not be interested in and try a whole bunch of stuff?
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.080]   No, I agree totally.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.680]   Actually, with early retirement, one of the last chapters in my book, I touch on this
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.160]   and I kind of harp on it a lot with other people, is this.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.680]   Have backup plans.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.720]   Basically, plan your retirement, keep it reasonable, but the reality is this.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.640]   You can't cover every contingency in your plan.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.800]   It's physically impossible to brainstorm every possible permutation of government policy,
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.600]   taxation development, and everything else that will happen in the next 40, 40 years.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.220]   So don't even try.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:44.700]   The odds of you getting it right are so minute, it's not even bother to go after.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.400]   So really, I just harp on the idea of have some backup plans.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.400]   Have some contingencies.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.480]   Like one of the backup plans in mine is this.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.040]   I don't use the house equity at all for anything in my plan.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.560]   It's just sitting there like an albatross not being used.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.000]   And the reality is, yes, I'm acutely aware of things could go wrong.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.120]   I could screw up.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.840]   I may have to go back to work.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   But the reality is this.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.880]   At least I have something sitting there as sort of the backup plan in case things go
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.040]   sideways and buying me some time and some flexibility going forward.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.280]   Other couple of little basic ones is this, is have some slush funds of cash available
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.900]   when you start your retirement.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.280]   The biggest thing I've seen over and over again is people taking money out during a
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.680]   down market and it's like going, "It's so easy to avoid.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.160]   Just keep two years slush fund in your freaking bank account for cash of just rolling GIC
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.480]   or whatever.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.640]   Any investment, I don't care what, as long as it's relatively available and that will
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.280]   help buy you time when things go sideways.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.480]   So when the market's tanking, you can sit there and go, "Oh, I'll just sit on the
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   sidelines for a couple of months.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   Thank you very much."
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   Absolutely.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:50.260]   People have this idea that just because you stop working, you can never work again.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.660]   And I'm telling you, I haven't.
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:56.340]   The only person so far that I brought on the show that stopped working and hasn't earned
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:03.540]   any money in retirement that I was able to find was Doug Nordman who retired at 41 and
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.220]   he's actually made a good amount of money since retiring.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.220]   He just gave it all away.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.980]   He gave it all to military charities from his books and from his blog and all of that.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.100]   He just has given the money away.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:23.140]   But there's this idea we're so connected with our corporate identity, our jobs.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   Who are you?
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.540]   What do you do is the question, not who are you.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:31.420]   And so one of the biggest challenges even with traditional retirement planning that
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:38.300]   I've learned is if you don't help a client transition their identity, you find it's
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.580]   a major part of successfully retiring.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.900]   Even if you're 65 years old and you're going to retire at that traditional age, so
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:50.980]   much of our identity is wrapped up in the work that we do instead of who we are that
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.220]   you've got to fix that psychologically to help people through it.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.060]   Oh, I agree totally.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.060]   The biggest thing I think to do from the happiness aspect is to bridge yourself from
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.020]   your current state of where you are in your work and your identity and everything else
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.620]   and how to build a new identity that's independent of your current work one and going forward.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.780]   Like one of the ones I say with people that you have to kind of focus on a little bit
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.340]   at least be aware of the issues.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.540]   Most people don't really consciously aware of this until they go through it.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.860]   Think about all the friends you have in your life and then think back to how you met all
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.900]   of them.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:25.300]   The average person will discover almost all of them had some inspiration and some level
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.860]   of work at some point.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.300]   And so your social interactions were largely out of your work.
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.580]   So when you retire, that's only gone if you take that away.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.020]   And then how are you going to fill that in, that void?
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:40.180]   And that's how you get a lot of unhappy retirees regardless of the age coming out is they didn't
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:45.060]   they plan the money side down the last dime, completely ignoring the other 2000 hours a
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.340]   year that was your job and suddenly is now available.
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.580]   You've got to consider you can't play golf every day.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.140]   I don't care who the hell you are, what you're trying to do and how much you love it.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.660]   The average person that won't work as a strategy.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.460]   So you have to develop interests.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.620]   You have to develop relationships and hobbies outside of your current thing and then build
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.980]   that up slowly.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.620]   So I love the idea of people that can manage to pull this off or they've reduced their
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:13.900]   amount of work slowly over a number of years and then stepped out of work on a slow basis.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.140]   I think if employers were more willing to put policies in place to support that, it
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.860]   leads to a better succession planning going forward because there's nothing better than
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.060]   someone who wants to be at work and doing their job.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.140]   I think about if you could have a situation where a retiree goes, "I'm going to pay that
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.140]   over three years.
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.300]   I'm going to start drop down to 80% time, then maybe 60 and then maybe 40 over a couple
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   of years."
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.220]   How beneficial that'd be for them because they free up their HR budget to hire a new
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.780]   employee who's junior and get umpteen years of training with the senior one.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.860]   And by the end, you have a senior person around who's happy to be there.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.380]   You can assign them a special project or something and they'll get it done and then they'll go.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.180]   They'll be happy to leave.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   Right.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.580]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:47:01.380]   I wonder if it would be … I guess it seems like it's such a small percentage of the
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:10.220]   population who is able to run their lifestyle on a lower amount of income.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:16.380]   Most people it seems in our society, their income equals their outgo and/or their outgo
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.300]   exceeds their income.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.820]   So there's not a lot of margin there.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:29.660]   But it would be interesting if somebody has margin, if they are an aggressive saver.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:34.300]   I know I would … if I were working in a career that was having a slowdown and we're
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.820]   saying, "We want to pool … we need to reduce our costs.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.780]   Would anybody like to volunteer to work 50% of the time for the next … we anticipate
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.940]   this is going to be for about six months."
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.860]   Then that would be a real benefit to an employer and to an employee to have almost a sabbatical
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.500]   where it's just 50% of the time or to be able to take a sabbatical.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:02.580]   And then as the general market trend, whatever market it is, comes back and they can just
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.420]   step back into their job.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.420]   I agree with you.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.420]   It would be nice to see that evolve.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.500]   Actually, I ran into a situation of when my second son was born, I took seven weeks of
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.820]   parental leave off.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.860]   My wife being self-employed didn't qualify for any government coverage on that.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:23.340]   So I actually capped in the program instead as the other parents and then my work was
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.340]   going through a bit of a slowdown.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.420]   I was doing a consulting firm at the time.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.820]   So my boss kept saying this to me over and over again, "I don't understand why you
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.820]   want to take the time off, but to have you off the books for seven weeks right now is
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.900]   really helpful.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.900]   So I'm approving this anyway."
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.900]   Right.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:42.740]   So it's funny that I got time alone with my family and that new baby and enjoyed it
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.740]   immensely.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.340]   And financially, we had savings so we could afford to do this.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.380]   It was a conscious choice on our part.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:53.660]   But the reality is a lot of companies aren't really set up to realize that that's a good
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.300]   thing or even talk to their employees like it's a good thing.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.980]   It tends to be this all or nothing approach to employment, unfortunately.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.180]   And as you see self-employment take off, it's almost interesting that some people have realized
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:09.660]   that's the route to go in regards of be your own employer and fire and hire clients as
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.380]   you need based on your interests.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.340]   My wife's in a really envious situation of the fact that she very much picks her clients
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:21.020]   based on personality and how they're going to do and their children are going to interact
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.660]   with the rest of the kids going on.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.500]   So she's very, very, very picky.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.740]   So she interviews a lot of potential clients but only approves a handful of them.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.380]   And she's very much in a market where the supply does not meet the demand at all.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.220]   So she can't afford to be picky.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.220]   Wow.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.860]   I think we could take that and apply that though as engineer.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.220]   I think it's awesome that she's in that situation.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.740]   My immediate thought is how can I be in that situation?
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:50.080]   And I think many of us, if we're running our own businesses especially or professional
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:56.740]   services in some capacity, we either can do it or we can create a plan to get there.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.860]   There's always been a benefit to me of my industry, which is financial planning, is
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:04.700]   that I could choose who I worked with and there were clients I just didn't like them
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.300]   and I never called them back.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:16.180]   And I fired two clients and actually formally said, "I'm not willing to work with you
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.500]   because I don't want to work with someone who is not a win-win."
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.580]   And that comes back to that self-direction, self-ownership.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:29.420]   I see one of the fundamental primary benefits of early retirement and teaching that as an
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:37.220]   approach is that it can build self-confidence under us as individuals, which will affect
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.660]   or can affect every aspect of our lives going forward.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:45.260]   If you have savings, even if you're not saying, "I can never work again," but if you have
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:51.460]   a year's worth of income in the bank, you're less likely to go after a client who's not
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.900]   a good fit for you because you need the money.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.220]   You're less likely to do a deal that's not a great fit for you because you need the money.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.820]   Usually you have some time and so you can work towards those great clients or those
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.180]   great deals or those great businesses.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.500]   You can do them better or right.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:17.980]   And in that sense, you can really, I think, build stronger businesses, stronger relationships,
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.820]   stronger customers.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.320]   And much of it starts from being on that solid foundation.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:27.760]   And I think over a lifetime, that can make a dramatic difference in someone's quality
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.760]   of life.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   I agree.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.880]   It can be helpful.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.180]   But the same concepts can even be applied to an employer situation.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.460]   Like right now, part of the reason I got my 90% time approved is I'm in a situation where
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.460]   I have 10 years worth of savings.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.300]   Living expenses saved up.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.860]   I really am brutally honest with my bosses about my situation and what I'm doing and
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.860]   what I'm interested in.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.580]   They're aware of my plan to retire early because hell no, it's on the internet.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.740]   Pretty hard to hide.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.700]   But the reality is they trust me because I've proven again and again, I'm here to give you
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.860]   my best advice.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.500]   I'm working for you.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.540]   But the reality is I also won't put up a certain degrees of bullshit.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.140]   I will tell them where I think they're making a mistake.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.180]   And some people are terrified to do that because they feel they're so dependent on their job
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.940]   because they're leaving month to month, just trying to keep their things going on.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:20.340]   So any degree of savings, I think, buys you that degree of confidence and satisfaction
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:24.060]   knowing you can talk to your employer and go, "Hi, I'm not interested in working full
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.060]   time.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.400]   I'm doing these other things in my life and I need the additional time.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.940]   Can we come up with an agreement that will work?"
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.940]   Right.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:37.260]   What percentage of your income have you strived to save over the last six years that you've
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.260]   been focusing on this project?
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:43.300]   Well, it's scaled up quite a bit over the years because I really kept the expenses largely
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.980]   similar over the course of the years, even with kids and everything else.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.780]   They've kept it quite below inflation in that regards.
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:52.780]   What we've managed to do is right now I'm saving about 65% of our income coming in.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:53.780]   Great.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.780]   Awesome.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:53:04.580]   I would imagine you might be familiar with, especially with your writing and reading about
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.200]   early retirement and financial planning within other cultures and other countries.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.320]   Do you think that you have it better as a Canadian, better off?
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.560]   Is it easier to do early retirement with a Canadian?
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.560]   Is it more difficult?
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.960]   Do you have any concept of the scale and the impact that living in Canada has made to your
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   life?
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:29.200]   I think Canada offers a really big benefit to early retirees that our basic health care
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.880]   is all covered by government.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.200]   So as you mentioned, the fact that we do pay quite a bit more taxes, so you have to be
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.680]   more aggressive in your tax planning front.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.480]   It's kind of the price you pay for it.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.560]   The option is this.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:43.240]   I know after my son was born, 10 weeks early, and he had two rounds of neurosurgery, I didn't
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.400]   have a bill for anything.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.800]   I didn't pay a dime, not one freaking dime.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   Why?
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.600]   Because our society as a whole was accepting the fact we pay more in taxes up front, but
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   that also means then that we don't have this disaster situation ever occurring where I'm
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.960]   going to have, oh, half a million dollars of debt from one medical procedure.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.200]   So from that end of things, it does change the context of, you'll notice in Canadian
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.000]   law, we don't really talk about insurance all that much for health care at all because
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.480]   it's kind of an incidental side one of, you have to worry about your dental and your vision
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.120]   and maybe some extra drug coverage at best, but the reality is all your basic stuff is
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.200]   already covered by the government.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   So it's kind of, I've heard some people who have read the blog from a U.S. perspective
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.960]   comment, it's almost refreshing to see someone who's not paranoid about health care in Canada
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.560]   because of her situation.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:38.120]   And so it does create a bit of an oddity of, it's not easier or harder, but the worries
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.560]   are quite a bit different of, I don't worry about those situations that most people in
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.280]   the States would have going, well, how am I going to cover health care?
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.280]   Do I have enough save?
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.040]   If I have a big issue, if my wife gets sick, do I have to go back to work?
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.480]   That doesn't really ever enter my head.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.400]   The option is though, my taxes are a heck of a lot more, so I have to be a little more
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.520]   forward thinking on that front and organizing and being aggressive on the tax planning side
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.080]   to kind of compensate for it.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.640]   That would seem to certainly be the easier thing to do.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   I don't know much about the Canadian tax system, but any progressive tax system and any progressive
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:22.000]   tax system is relatively easy to work among, and especially when you can build out the
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.600]   ability to live a great lifestyle on not much money.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.520]   That allows you to take advantage of all the deferral accounts, and those deferral accounts
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.160]   can help over time.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.840]   And then because you don't need to make much money, you don't need, excuse me, because
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.440]   you don't need to spend much money, you don't need to make as much money, and you don't
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.360]   need to save and accumulate as much money to live a great lifestyle, and so therefore
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:50.680]   you can avoid the strong penalties for doing well with a progressive tax rate.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.000]   I mean, to me that would seem the easier thing to do.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Am I wrong, right?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   What do you think?
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.840]   No, I think you're kind of on the broad strokes of what makes it easy.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.520]   You do have to think about it, and it's not earth-shatteringly difficult, but you do have
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.960]   to remember that the reality is as you keep saving, your interests get aligned with the
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.040]   business community a lot more, and you realize the tax code is really set up for businesses.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.680]   And that whole investment thing, it's very much encouraging that end of things.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:21.880]   And so as such, I've noticed that the more I save, the more I agree with the tax system
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.000]   here and the progressive nature of it.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.640]   So yes, the people who are making millions and millions of dollars are paying a lot of
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.360]   tax in theory, but the reality is they have a ream of options available to them to kind
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.600]   of defer, hide, otherwise manipulate their tax bill into something a little more reasonable.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:41.960]   As people like to think Canada's really expensive, but really when you get aggressive on your
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.560]   planning side of things, it's pretty easy to bounce things off.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.080]   Like what happens for me is my marginal tax rate, the most tax I pay on that last dime
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:55.000]   of dollar I make is about 40%, which sounds really high, but when you consider after I'm
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.800]   done filing my taxes each year, my average tax rate is only 20%.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:06.600]   All right, what's the highest marginal bracket in Canada that you know?
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.200]   Not much further past that, it's pushing almost 50%.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.560]   Okay, well that's, we're up to 55% in the US and the highest brackets when you bring
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:18.240]   in the extra taxes with the Affordable Care Act.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:25.800]   So it's interesting that it's comparable at this point for high income earners.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:32.080]   So I think my guess is that your brackets are probably at a lower, do you have any idea
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.240]   where you enter into that top bracket as far as how much income puts you in ballpark?
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.800]   Oh, I can't remember off the top because the issue is here we have dual brackets.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.160]   We have each province has their own tax brackets and the federal government has its own tax
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.040]   brackets on top of that, so they don't always align.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.160]   It ends up these weird little permutations that crop up.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.960]   Crudely, I'd say maybe about 150,000 is where you start entering up towards the top
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   or end.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.880]   So that would be the difference because in the US it's much more, depending on the
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:05.720]   makeup it's much more, it's much closer to 400,000-ish, higher or lower to get you
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.760]   into that top bracket depending on the structure.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.520]   So that would be one of the major differences.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.520]   Last question that I have and then I'll give you the final word to share anything
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:21.560]   that you want to share, but the last question on my list is what are the biggest objections
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.560]   that you get on the blog or as a result of the book?
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.600]   Some people come over the book and they say, "Well, this is just a stupid idea."
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.040]   What are the objections that you get most commonly?
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:37.680]   I'd say probably the most common two objections I get is one, people like to complain, "I'm
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.680]   all theoretical.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   I've never actually done it.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.600]   I'm not there yet because I'm still working towards actually getting there," ignoring
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.960]   the fact of what I've saved or accomplished in the last six years.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:51.800]   Like somehow the fact that I've already got $300,000 saved is nothing, which I kind
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.080]   of laugh at because I'm like, "Well, really, given my age, a lot of people do not have
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.720]   that much money in the bank and a paid off house.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.080]   It doesn't really happen that frequently."
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.120]   The other big one is they don't believe it's possible to live on that low amount
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   of money.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.720]   It seems to be the other common one that crops up.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.640]   They just seem flabbergasted that you can spend so little amount of money and still
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.560]   be a middle class existence that's pretty normal and happy.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.240]   That's where I get back to that whole aspect of the key thing is to really personalize
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   your spending.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.280]   It's not that it matters to you to spend accordingly.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.960]   My wife likes clothes a lot more than I do.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.480]   I can wear the same three pair of jeans all week and I really don't care.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:34.120]   She cares a lot more and so she tends to keep her spending cash and puts that into clothes
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.520]   because she cares about that.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.900]   But even with her, she's kind of aware of ... Sometimes she gets into these mindless
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.880]   buying patterns where she's like, "I'm not really even enjoying what I bought.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   This is silly."
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:49.200]   Because she works in daycare, she doesn't want to wear her nice stuff during the day,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.600]   during the week because, hello, she has kids throwing things or other craft projects that
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   get messy clothing.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.960]   So she's realized that she's changed things around a little bit.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.760]   On the weekend, she wears her nice stuff now.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.280]   So she's always outdressing me everywhere we go.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   That's fine.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   Right.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.120]   You know what's interesting to me?
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:16.280]   Both of those objections are absolute stupid logical fallacies, but yet they're pervasive
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.880]   in both of our cultures.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.840]   They're certainly pervasive in the US context and in the Canadian context, it sounds like
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.440]   they're pervasive.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.040]   Number one is, the first one is an ad hominem attack.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.080]   Well, who are you to say that?
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.240]   Instead of dealing with your actual argument and trying to find a flaw in your logic or
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.640]   in your argument and disproving the argument, it's an attack on you that just because you
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.840]   say this can be done but you haven't done it means that it's not possible.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:50.080]   And then the second one is basically personal incredulity, simply saying that just because
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.560]   I find it difficult to believe, it's therefore not true.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.960]   Well, just because you find it difficult to believe doesn't have any bearing on whether
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.280]   it's true or not.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:04.160]   So this is on a societal perspective.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.080]   It seems as though societally speaking, we have lost the ability to think in terms of
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:16.640]   logic and fact and we resort to fallacies instead.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.120]   And it's a shame because if somebody can start and identify those fallacies that just be
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.240]   – if they can identify the fallacies, they can gain and they can join you and me on our
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.680]   early retirement journey.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.240]   Well, that's actually true.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.640]   I've actually been struggling with this.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.880]   Since I wrote the first book, I've been trying to come up with how – that was the
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.200]   core of my problem was how do you get people to get past this default point of view thing.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.120]   And so I've been struggling for multiple years here trying to come up with a format
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.880]   of a book that would work to try to actually deal with that exact issue of teaching people
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.560]   that your life is largely constructed defaults.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.560]   You didn't decide much of anything of who – where you live, what job you're in,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.160]   everything else was very unusually defaulted decision-making, not per se conscious in a
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.320]   lot of cases.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:11.240]   And so you don't really realize how different your life could be if you just let it.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.200]   And then even the harder thing is then how do you transition from one lifestyle to another
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.280]   lifestyle, which is where I'm struggling to write a book on it.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   Absolutely.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.520]   Well, Tim, this has been fun.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.280]   Do you have any final words of encouragement or thoughts that you would like to leave with
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.360]   the audience as we go?
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.400]   I think the biggest thing is to get comfortable with disbelief of things.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.520]   A lot of people say they don't believe it's possible for me and I'm like, "Well,
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.520]   I don't really believe it's possible to waste $100,000 a year of income every year
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.560]   on a lifestyle that looks largely similar to mine," which I'm doing on 30.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.240]   So it's finding out you're comfortable being yourself and realize it's okay to
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.880]   do that and aim for that and then structure your life around that.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.960]   Give yourself permission to be different.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.040]   It's okay.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040]   It's supposed to be different.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]   We're not all clones.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.000]   We're not all coming from the same little vats of whatever DNA.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.520]   We all have different opinions and thoughts and patterns.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.960]   So build your life around you, not what everyone else tells you to be.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.480]   Tim, this has been fun.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.880]   I appreciate you coming on and I look forward to following your journey.
