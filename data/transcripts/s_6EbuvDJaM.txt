[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880]   Well, we get a regular flow of email questions about eternal rewards, and rightly so.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.320]   And today's question comes to us from Song, who asks this, "Pastor John, regarding 1
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.840]   Corinthians 3 verses 10 to 15, what does this mean that our work done in Christ will be
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.400]   tested by fire and will get rewarded accordingly?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600]   What of our works will burn up?
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.020]   What's the difference between what this burning leaves unburned and what is consumed?"
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.640]   How would you answer these questions?
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.520]   It's probably important that we read this, in fact, maybe go back a little farther than
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:51.400]   verse 10 because the context here matters to get things oriented correctly.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   This text, people can test this.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.880]   Now when I read it, it's not first or mainly about the general good works of all believers,
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.360]   though I think the implication is going to be there, but it's first and mainly about
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.620]   service in the Word to the church and how she's built up, putting stones in place and
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.180]   building the church with right teaching.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.300]   So let me read it and you look for that, whether or not some teachings are combustible straw
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.760]   and some teachings are precious stones.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.200]   I'm going to start at verse 5, not verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 3.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.640]   What then is Apollos?
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.440]   What is Paul?
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.160]   Servants through whom you believed as the Lord assigned to each.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.540]   I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.440]   So comment.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.520]   He's starting with the analogy of farming, but he's going to shift to the analogy of
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560]   architecture and building in just a minute.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.200]   So be alert to that change when it comes.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.400]   So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.880]   He who plants and he who waters are one and each will receive his wages according to his
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   labor.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.540]   So comment.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.800]   He's talking about rewards, these wages that you're going to get.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   He's talking about rewards for how he and Apollos planted and watered.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.160]   That is how they ministered the word of God for the planting and the growth of the church.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.080]   Now verse 9, for we are God's fellow workers.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.240]   You are God's field, God's building.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.480]   There's the transition from farming to architecture and building.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   According to the grace of God, verse 10, according to the grace of God given to me like a skilled
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   master builder.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.120]   So he's fully into the new metaphor now.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.640]   I laid a foundation and someone else is building on it.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.520]   Let each one take care how he builds on it.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   Comment.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   So you can see that the context is building on the foundation of Christ with kinds of
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.960]   teaching, which of course is interwoven with kinds of living because what you teach is
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.800]   aimed at producing a new way of life.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.000]   Verse 11, for no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Christ.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.800]   If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   comment.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.920]   So following the flow of the thought, I take gold and silver and precious stones to be
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.400]   faithful, biblical, apostolical, edifying truth that you're building on gospel foundations
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.600]   with, while wood, hay, and straw refers to teachings that are either false or distorted
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.820]   or out of proportion or self-serving or contrary to the gospel in some way or contaminated
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.640]   with sinful thoughts or ways.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:22.080]   Now verse 13, each one's work will become manifest for the day we'll disclose it because
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.920]   it will be revealed by fire and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.220]   If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.760]   If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss though he himself will be saved, but
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.460]   only as through fire.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.940]   So here are four implications I'm going to draw out of that text and that comment.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.100]   It is possible to be a true Christian and for various reasons have a distorted view
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:10.940]   of some truth in the Bible and actually mislead the church with those teachings that are not
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.260]   fully biblical and be saved.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.000]   Go to heaven.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.640]   Those teachers will be saved according to verse 15, though their work will be burned
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.780]   up or at least part of it will be burned up.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.100]   So we can be thankful.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.860]   Oh my goodness.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.860]   Think of it.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.820]   Think of all the denominational differences among us.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.380]   Think of insider denominations, how many different ways we interpret scripture sometimes and
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.480]   how many different things we view.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:48.160]   If we had to be flawless and perfect in our teaching, pastors, small group leaders, parents,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.380]   in order to be truly Christian, there'd be no hope, right?
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.340]   God is merciful and willing to forgive.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.900]   I'm tempted to point out all the errors other people make instead of me.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.380]   I'm sure we're all going to have our knuckles wrapped significantly by the Lord that we
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.860]   couldn't see more clearly in the Bible, but not every mistake is a damning mistake.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.820]   So that's the first observation.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:27.020]   Two, that should not make us careless about the scriptures because this is real loss,
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.020]   real loss.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.580]   We suffer loss when our teaching works get burned up.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.880]   There are real rewards that we will not have if we teach error.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.860]   And even more serious than the loss of rewards, if we're cavalier about our teaching as if
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.260]   it doesn't matter, that might be a sign that we really are not standing on the foundation
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.500]   of Christ and are not Christian teachers at all.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.320]   It does come to that with some teachers.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.200]   That was the kind of thing Jesus had to say about the Pharisees.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.460]   They were professional teachers and had fundamentally failed to understand the Old Testament and
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.020]   were not part of God's faithful remnant.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.820]   Third implication, when you try to think through what it really means that the works are burned
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   up, it seems likely to me that this refers not just to a false teaching being exposed
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:38.640]   and excluded from heaven, but it says in verse 14 that the teacher's work will be burned
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   up.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:47.460]   That is, he's built something with his teaching and what he's built may just go poof in the
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.740]   judgment.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.560]   Things he thought he had constructed with teachings will be found to be worthless.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.020]   And the scary thing is that may include people and ministries.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.580]   It may include the lives of people that he thought he'd brought to Christ and built up
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.300]   in the faith.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.380]   And it proves that they weren't Christians at all because they didn't understand the
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:15.220]   gospel because it was so clouded by what he taught, though he himself was a Christian.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:21.540]   And the whole ministry he may have built on his clouded view just goes poof in the fires
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.420]   of judgment.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:30.420]   And the last implication I would draw out of this is that in 2 John 1, 8, we have everything
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.420]   echoed again.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:40.180]   "Watch yourselves so that you may not lose what you have worked for, but may win a full
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.460]   reward."
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:50.080]   And I think that suggests that even though the main focus of 1 Corinthians 3 is not general
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:58.500]   works of believers but true and false teaching, it does imply that the application—in other
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:06.740]   words, there's an implication here that the lives of Christians in general are also instructed.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:13.220]   Paul says, for example, in Ephesians 6, 8, "Knowing that whatever good anyone does, this
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.500]   he will receive back from the Lord."
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.540]   Everything, every good is going to get its reward.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:26.220]   So it isn't just teachers who need to be vigilant over what they teach, but all Christians need
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:32.820]   to be vigilant over what they do or what they do with what they are taught, whether they
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.220]   themselves build themselves up in their most holy faith with what they hear.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:45.060]   So when it comes to the impact on the building of the church, the building, the effect would
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:52.900]   be the same if a false teaching produced a false disciple or a true teaching produced
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:59.740]   a false disciple because the disciple himself hardened his own heart and rejected the truth
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.900]   that he was faithfully taught.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.100]   In either case, the church is damaged.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:11.620]   In either case, the living stones that were supposed to be built into a holy temple for
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:17.540]   the Lord would prove to be no living stones at all.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.000]   In one case, that might be owing in part to bad teaching.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.180]   In another case, it might be owing to a failure to live out good teaching.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.020]   So everybody needs to be vigilant with how we build, how we build others and how we build
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.140]   ourselves with what others teach us.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:45.500]   So the final upshot of the text for all of us, I think, it's a call to teachers and learners,
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:54.020]   every Christian, to stand on the one foundation, Jesus Christ, and build ourselves and build
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:01.780]   others as living stones into a faithful growing church where Christ dwells and to do it with
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.620]   as much truth as we can see.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.820]   Sobering and motivational as well.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.820]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.660]   And thank you for making this podcast a part of your weekly routine.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.620]   We appreciate all the many of you who subscribe and listen in each week.

[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.180]   Well probably one of the most difficult things about parenting is knowing when and how to
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:39.820]   explain to our children the reality of God's eternal judgment, eternal torment away from
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.140]   the presence of God.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.860]   This is a hard truth.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.860]   And of course we can wield it unwisely, but it's also an essential truth and we are obligated
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.220]   to help our children to understand it.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.140]   But how do we go about it in a tactful way?
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.820]   John Piper has a lot of thoughts on this and if you are a parent, this will be an episode
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.380]   I think you will not want to miss.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.900]   That's going to be on Wednesday of this week.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.780]   So you can return and join us then.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
