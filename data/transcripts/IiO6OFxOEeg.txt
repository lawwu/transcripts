[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.360]   A listener named Chelsea writes in,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.880]   hello Pastor John, thank you for providing so much wisdom
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.880]   and encouragement through your answers on this podcast.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.660]   I've been thinking about how the Spirit speaks to us
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.200]   among things that are not necessarily evil or wrong.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.640]   In those things, does God ever give us an anxiety
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.360]   or a fear in order to direct us away
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.740]   from something in our lives?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.880]   What would you say to Chelsea?
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.880]   - Well, first, let me try to imagine some situations
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.240]   that Chelsea might be talking about, 'cause I'm not sure.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.900]   So I need to tell her what I'm thinking she's meaning,
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.640]   so she'll know what question I'm really answering.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.920]   She explicitly refers to things
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.320]   that are not necessarily evil or wrong.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.580]   So the question, it seems, is not whether God
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.660]   could put a fear of sin in our lives
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.600]   to direct us away from sin, which He certainly can,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.180]   but whether God might use fear or anxiety
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.160]   to direct her away from something
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.220]   which in itself is innocent.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.120]   So perhaps she might have in mind,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.580]   this is what comes to my mind,
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.480]   should I accept an opportunity
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.760]   to become a missionary in Saudi Arabia
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.520]   where you can be jailed for practicing the Christian faith,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   or should I move into the inner city
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.240]   of a crime-ridden neighborhood to live and minister there,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.980]   or should I go hunting for grizzly bears?
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.840]   I don't know what kind of things she might have in mind.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.680]   So her question would be, in any of those situations
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.460]   or others like them, does God give us an anxiety
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.080]   or a fear to direct us away from them
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.720]   because those aren't His will for us,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.200]   even though they're not bad,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.600]   they're just not His will for us?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.980]   And here's my answer.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.160]   God can and may do this,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.040]   but we should never seek to be guided this way.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.320]   And the reason I don't think we should ever seek
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.520]   to be guided through being anxious or fearful
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.580]   about something that is not sinful
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.080]   is that Jesus says things like this.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.520]   Do not fear those who kill the body
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.500]   but cannot kill the soul.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.920]   Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.340]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.120]   Not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.640]   apart from your father,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.320]   but even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.520]   Fear not, therefore.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.320]   You are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.880]   Matthew 10, 26, following.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.520]   So it seems to me that Jesus does not want us
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   to be motivated by fear of what man can do to us
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.180]   when we are confronted with the prospect of witness
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.100]   or ministry for Him.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.200]   Whether we follow through with a particular path
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.900]   of mission or witness should depend on other things
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.260]   besides being afraid of man.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.980]   So here's another example.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.360]   Peter said to wives who were married to unbelievers
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.680]   in 1 Peter 3,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   the holy women who hoped in God,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   the holy women hoped in God, like Sarah,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.880]   and you are her children if you do good
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   and do not fear anything that is frightening.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   In other words, hoping in God should give these women
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560]   such a confidence in God's care
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.840]   that they're not afraid of anything
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.820]   so that their relationship towards their husband,
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.820]   in this case, is not governed by fear but by humble wisdom.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.080]   So they're making choices
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.300]   not because they're motivated by anxiety or fear
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.800]   to avoid certain things,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.160]   but because of other factors of gracious wisdom,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.480]   but not fear because hoping in God
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.040]   has taken away that fear.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.160]   So that's why I say I don't think this strategy
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.720]   of seeking guidance is one we should pursue.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.160]   We should not pursue,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.720]   Lord, give me, please, feelings of anxiety and fear
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.880]   about this non-sinful path as a way of discerning
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.280]   whether I should take those paths or not.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.080]   I don't think we should pray like that or seek like that.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.440]   So she may be wondering,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.560]   well, then, why did you say
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.760]   that God can indeed guide us this way
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.000]   if we shouldn't seek it?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.040]   And the answer is that God can use sin
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   to bring about circumstances that he wants to take place.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.280]   We know this from the story of Joseph.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.280]   God, in his providence, moved Joseph to Egypt.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.440]   That was his will.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.400]   Get Joseph down to Egypt.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.760]   He's gonna save his people someday.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   And how did he get him there?
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.520]   Through the sinful attitudes of his brothers.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   So the fact that God can give guidance
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.600]   through sinful attitudes doesn't mean
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.200]   we should pursue the sinful attitudes.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.720]   I presume if he wanted to,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.160]   he could have gotten Joseph to Egypt
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.360]   through Joseph's sinful attitudes.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.880]   That's not what the Bible teaches,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.420]   but he could have done it.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.040]   Joseph happened to be a very godly man.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.720]   So the fact that God can guide us through our anxieties
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.780]   or other people's sins,
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.520]   and those anxieties would be sinful, I think,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.300]   doesn't mean we should pursue them.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.000]   Now, I just thought of one,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.240]   I thought of one other qualification of what I've said,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.000]   although it may not be,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.840]   maybe it's not a qualification, maybe it's an expansion.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   God does guide us, and we should seek to be guided,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.780]   away from intrinsically non-sinful behaviors
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.780]   by causing us to regard them as foolishly dangerous,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.300]   which comes, I admit, very close to fear or anxiety.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.040]   For example, if someone told me
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.500]   to walk across the Grand Canyon,
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.320]   like that guy did recently, on a tightrope,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.020]   I would say, "No."
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.300]   (laughs)
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.020]   And if they said, "Are you afraid?"
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.360]   I think the true answer would be,
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.220]   I would be afraid on a tightrope,
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.460]   but the reason I'm saying no
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.460]   is because I am sure I would fall
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.700]   because I can't walk on a tightrope,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   and I think it's foolish, it's foolish of me.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.540]   I would even say sinfully foolish of me
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.220]   to put my life at risk for no good purpose.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.360]   That's what I mean by being guided by something,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.620]   away from something that is foolishly dangerous.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.060]   Or here's maybe a more realistic and helpful example,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.060]   a skydiving.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.160]   I think that if I were in the military,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.260]   and we were in a war,
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.980]   and it was my job to serve my country
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.220]   and my fellow combatants,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.660]   to jump out of a plane with a parachute,
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.940]   I could jump out all day long.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.780]   I really could.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.060]   I think I could get up there,
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.740]   let's go, pull that thing, come on,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.980]   let's go win this battle,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.460]   and I'd jump out all day long.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.460]   But I will never skydive as a recreation.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.820]   It doesn't feel like fear at all to me, Frank.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.140]   It doesn't feel like fear
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.700]   'cause I'd jump out all day long
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.300]   if I were in the military.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.620]   It just seems foolish to me
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.620]   to put yourself at risk of absolutely certain death
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.300]   (laughs)
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.180]   with one small malfunctioning of a parachute
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.260]   made by fallible human beings.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.620]   So I just think that is foolish,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.900]   and therefore I think it will direct me away
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.460]   from that innocent, in itself, behavior.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.380]   So I hope that I didn't complicate matters too much.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.820]   But back to my main answer.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.340]   Here it is, close.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.700]   Even though God can turn our anxieties
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.500]   for his own sovereign guiding purposes,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.740]   this is not a method of guidance
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.580]   or discernment we should pursue.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.260]   - Wonderful, and we have an entire episode on skydiving.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.780]   If you want more on this theme,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.980]   safety is a myth, it's episode 10, an oldie,
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.980]   way back in the archive.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.820]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.380]   You can find that old episode,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.820]   and you can keep up with the daily

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.860]   - Well, when it comes to suffering and pain,
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.660]   none of us are immune,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.180]   and that pain so often feels pointless.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.980]   And in fact, the pain in our lives
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.040]   is not pointless at all.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.300]   So what does suffering produce?
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.720]   What is it doing in our lives?
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   That's tomorrow.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.900]   I'm your host, Tony Garanke.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.500]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.820]   (whooshing)
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.140]   (whooshing)
