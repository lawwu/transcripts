[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   [silence]
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.720]   One of the really bad effects of alcohol,
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.340]   but that's extremely well-documented,
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.960]   is the fact that alcohol,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.720]   because of this toxicity of acetyl aldehyde
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.200]   and related pathways, can alter DNA methylation.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.960]   It can alter gene expression.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380]   That can mean many things in different tissues,
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.380]   but it is associated with a significant increase
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.160]   in cancer risk, in particular, breast cancer,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.720]   and in particular, because breast tissue
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.240]   is present in both males and females,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.100]   but in women, it's especially vulnerable
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.560]   to some of the DNA methylation changes.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.820]   Well, breast cancer in women
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.580]   has a relationship to alcohol intake,
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.040]   and alcohol intake has a relationship
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.820]   to breast cancer in women.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.160]   In fact, there has been proposed to be
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.860]   anywhere from four to 13% increase
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.820]   in risk of breast cancer
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.640]   for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.880]   How much is 10 grams?
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.480]   Well, there we need to think a little bit
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.360]   about the variation in the amount of alcohol
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.000]   in different drinks across the world.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   Different countries serve different sized drinks
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.440]   and have different concentrations of alcohol
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   in those drinks.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.720]   So without going down too much of a rabbit hole
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   and just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.760]   there've been studies of the percentage of alcohol
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.840]   included in different drinks
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.180]   and the sizes of different drinks
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.360]   that are served in different countries,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.480]   and here's a kind of a patchwork of those findings.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.980]   In Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.800]   or one shot of liquor as it's served there
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.480]   tends to include anywhere from seven to eight grams
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.920]   of alcohol.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.980]   In the US, one beer, which generally is 12 ounces,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.080]   if it's in a bottle,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.440]   one glass of wine or a shot of liquor
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.440]   tends to include about 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.420]   And in Russia, one drink of the various sorts
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.360]   that I just described,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.800]   typically will have as much as 24 grams of alcohol
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.520]   because of the differences in the concentration of alcohols
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.920]   and the sizes of drinks that are poured
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.560]   in these different countries, okay?
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.960]   Of course, there are other countries in the world,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.660]   those countries are also vitally important,
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.440]   but those are the ones that extracted from the studies
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.400]   that I could find.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   What does this mean?
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.020]   Well, what we're talking about
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.680]   is that for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.240]   so that's one beer in the US,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.640]   maybe a little bit more than one beer in Japan,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   or basically a third of a drink in Russia,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   there's a four to 13% increase in risk of cancer.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.360]   That's pretty outrageous, right?
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.240]   And you might think, wait,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.360]   how could it be that this stuff is even legal?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.800]   Well, look, as I described before, it's a toxin.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.880]   It's also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.160]   I mean, in the US, at least they tried prohibition.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   It certainly did lead.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.320]   Yes, did lead to a reduction
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.760]   in alcohol-induced health disorders,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.240]   in particular cirrhosis of the liver.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.920]   It also led to a lot of crime
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.740]   because it became a substance
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.760]   that a lot of people still wanted
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.980]   and that people were willing to break the law
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.520]   in order to provide, or I should say to sell and provide.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.940]   But the point is that the more alcohol people drink,
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.240]   the greater their increase of cancer,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.360]   in particular breast cancer.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.400]   And that's because of the fact
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.200]   that alcohol has these effects on cells
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.280]   that include changes in gene expression.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.120]   And cancer, that is the growth of tumors,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.920]   is a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.260]   A tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.280]   Aggregation is stuff sticking together, by the way.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.880]   Proliferation is stuff duplicating.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.720]   A proliferation and aggregation of cells
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.880]   that could be a glioma, is glial cells,
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.480]   glioma, brain tumor, right?
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.380]   It could be lymphoma, so within the lymph tissue, et cetera.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.680]   The mutations that alcohol induces to cause this
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.000]   are wide ranging.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Some of those are starting to start to be understood.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.680]   For those of you that are interested in cell biology,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   I'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.920]   again, this is super specialized
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.520]   and for the aficionados only.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.920]   You don't need to know this.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.040]   The PD-1 pathway seems to be upregulated.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.600]   And, and we knew this from the discussion earlier,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.200]   there's a downregulation
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.500]   in some of the anti-inflammatory molecules
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.120]   that help suppress this proliferation of cancers.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.480]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.920]   in the fact that the immune system
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.100]   is constantly combating cancers
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.440]   that exist in us all the time.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.360]   You know, little tumors start growing
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.400]   and our immune system goes and gobbles them up.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.780]   Little tumors start growing,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.620]   the immune system senses inflammation,
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.040]   sends out these incredible cells,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.000]   these killer B cells and T cells and beats them up.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.380]   Cancers proliferate and take hold
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.900]   and cause serious problems
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.020]   when the proliferation of cells
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.180]   exceeds the immune system's ability
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.680]   to gobble up and remove those cells.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.660]   There are other mechanisms of regulating cancers,
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.980]   but that's one of the primary one.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.980]   And alcohol hits it, again, it's a two-hit model.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.860]   It increases tumor growth
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.380]   and it decreases the sorts of molecules
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.020]   that suppress and combat tumor growth.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.460]   So again, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.420]   can be problematic for sake of cancers,
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.080]   in particular, breast cancers.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.860]   Epidemiologists and health specialists
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.460]   love to try and compare different substances
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.020]   in terms of how bad they are.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.040]   Rarely do they compare substances
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.460]   in terms of how good they are, but sometimes they do.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.780]   And what they'll sometimes tell you
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.100]   and what you can find in the literature
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.380]   is that ingesting 10 to 15 grams of alcohol a day,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.140]   so that would be like one beer in the US,
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.220]   one glass of wine,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.260]   is the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.780]   Frankly, it's hard to make that direct relationship
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.780]   really stick because it's a question of
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.980]   how long people inhale,
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.320]   do they have a predisposition to a lung cancer, et cetera.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.180]   But even if that number is off
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.400]   by plus or minus two cigarettes,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.820]   or even if that number would,
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.500]   the equivalent of one glass of wine
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.020]   equals one cigarette per day,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.180]   I think there's general consensus now
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.240]   that nicotine consumed by vaping or by cigarette
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.300]   it's bad for us in terms of lung cancer
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.780]   and other forms of cancer.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.260]   And for some reason, I don't know why,
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.140]   because this knowledge about alcohol and cancer
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.420]   and these established relationships
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.620]   have been known since the late 1980s.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.980]   The first kind of landmark paper on this
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.380]   was published in 1987.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.540]   I can provide a link to that paper,
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.580]   it's actually quite interesting to read.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.980]   Well, the relationship is there
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.180]   and yet we don't often hear about it, right?
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.320]   In fact, before researching this episode,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.720]   I had heard before that alcohol can increase cancer risk,
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.040]   but I wasn't aware of just how strong that relationship is.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.560]   Because of the serious nature of what we're talking about
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.540]   and because I would hate to be confusing
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.920]   or misleading to anybody,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.520]   I want to just emphasize that this statistic,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.600]   that there is a four to 13%,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.000]   depending on which study you look at,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.200]   a four to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.440]   in particular breast cancer,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.940]   for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.480]   that's 10 grams per day.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.560]   So that's one drink per day.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.720]   But I do want to emphasize
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.920]   that if that equates to seven drinks per week
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.540]   and all those seven drinks are being consumed
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.920]   on Friday and Saturday,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.560]   it still averages to 10 grams per day.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.880]   And I also want to emphasize
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.840]   that there are things that people can do
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.480]   to at least partially offset
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.640]   some of the negative effects of alcohol
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.080]   as it relates to predisposition
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.880]   to the formation of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.220]   I also want to be clear before I say it
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.740]   that doing the things I'm about to tell you
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.540]   is not a guarantee that you're not going to get cancer,
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.380]   nor is it a guarantee that alcohol
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.180]   is not going to lead to an increased predisposition
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.620]   for certain kinds of cancers.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.960]   And the two things are consumption of folate
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.180]   and other B vitamins, especially B12.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.060]   You know, the consumption of folate and B12
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.720]   has been shown to decrease cancer risk
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.920]   in people that ingest alcohol,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.240]   but not completely offset it.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.180]   Why that is isn't exactly clear.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.400]   It probably has something to do
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.760]   with the relationship between folate and B12
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.440]   and other B vitamins in gene regulation pathways
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.720]   that can lead to tumor growth.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.840]   At some point soon, we will get an expert in cancer biology
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.560]   and in particular in breast cancer biology on the program,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.160]   and we can ask them about this.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.920]   But I realize this is going to raise a number of questions
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.100]   and maybe even cause some of you to go out there
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.500]   and start taking folate and other B vitamins and B12.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.420]   Not incidentally, a lot of the reported hangover supplements
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.100]   and treatments include folate and B12.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.580]   I don't know if they had the cancer literature in mind
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.780]   when they created those supplements and products.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.620]   I doubt they did.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.980]   Alcohol really does disrupt B vitamin pathways,
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.000]   both synthesis pathways and utilization pathways.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.140]   So sometimes you'll hear,
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.540]   oh, you know, if you get your B vitamins,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.020]   it helps you recover from hangover more quickly.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.200]   Again, the literature doesn't support that,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.300]   but also again, there aren't a lot of studies,
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.820]   but more to the point as it relates to alcohol
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.780]   and the formation of tumors and cancers,
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.860]   it does appear that decreased folate
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.500]   and other B vitamins like B12 are partially responsible
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.700]   for the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.020]   And it does appear that consuming adequate amounts
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.140]   of folate and B12 might, again,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.820]   might partially, I really want to bold face
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.020]   and underline and highlight,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.400]   partially offset some of that increased risk.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.980]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.800]   (upbeat music)
