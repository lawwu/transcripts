[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.300]   - We close out the week with a question from Bob,
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.380]   a podcast listener who writes in to ask a simple question,
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.580]   but a very good question as well.
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.420]   Simply put, why did Jesus insist
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.420]   on being baptized by John the Baptist?
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.460]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.600]   - The fullest description of the baptism of Jesus
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.580]   is given in Matthew's Gospel, chapter three.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.580]   So let's let Matthew guide us in answering the question,
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.780]   why did Jesus insist on being baptized by John?
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.740]   There are at least two things that Matthew makes plain
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.500]   about John's baptism, which are relevant
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   for why Jesus would insist on submitting to this baptism.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.700]   First, Matthew says in verse six, chapter three,
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.500]   that people were coming to be baptized,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.300]   confessing their sins.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.020]   And then he quotes John in verse 11,
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.340]   "I baptize you with water for repentance."
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.440]   So Matthew was making plain that the purpose
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.260]   of John's baptism was to provide an occasion
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.860]   for Jewish people to confess their sins
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.700]   and repent and get right with God.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.540]   That's the first thing.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.540]   Second, John makes clear that his baptism of repentance
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.420]   is bringing into being a people of God
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.100]   for the coming Messiah,
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.380]   and that he's bringing this people into being
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.380]   with an identity that is not identical
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.760]   with their Jewishness, but with their repentance.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.020]   We see it in verse nine.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.560]   He says to the Pharisees who had come out to the river,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.740]   "And do not presume to say to yourselves,
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.600]   "We have Abraham as our father.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.900]   "For I tell you, God is able from these stones
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.940]   "to raise up children to Abraham."
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.940]   What does that mean?
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.260]   It means there is no salvation and no security
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.660]   in claiming your lineage from Abraham.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.420]   God is free in choosing who will be in his people.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.240]   He could make saints of his own out of rocks
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.780]   if he wanted to.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.520]   So the new people of God that are being gathered
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.880]   by this baptism, being prepared for the coming Messiah,
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.460]   Jesus, are marked by repentance
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.640]   and the fruit that comes from repentance.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   And they are not like the Pharisees,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.540]   depending on their ethnicity or their religious pedigree
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.560]   by saying, "We have Abraham as our father."
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.960]   Now, Jesus comes into that situation,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   and John says to him, "Whoa, I need to be baptized by you.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.040]   "And do you come to me to be baptized?"
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   In other words, he makes crystal clear
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.000]   that Jesus does not need this baptism.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.880]   He does not need to repent.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.920]   He does not need to confess any sins.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.520]   So why are you here?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.640]   And Jesus gives one sentence in answer,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.160]   and it is massively important.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.080]   He says, "Let it now be so,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.780]   "for thus it is fitting for us
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.280]   "to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.480]   It is fitting.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.440]   That's why he's doing it.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.600]   It's fitting.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.680]   Well, what is fitting?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   Fulfilling all righteousness is fitting.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.920]   Evidently, Jesus saw his life
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.120]   as the fulfillment of all righteousness.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   And the fact that participating in a baptism of repentance,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.340]   even though he had no sins to repent of,
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.020]   is part of that, shows that the righteousness
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.080]   he wanted to fulfill was the righteousness required
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.720]   not of himself, but of every sinful man.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.100]   Jesus had read Isaiah 53.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.040]   Indeed, Isaiah 53 was his life mission.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.940]   And here's what he read in verse 11.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.320]   "By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.620]   "make many to be accounted righteous."
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.360]   So the righteous one will cause many
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.560]   to be counted righteous.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   So my answer to the question why Jesus insisted
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   on being baptized is that this new people
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.880]   who were being gathered by John the Baptist
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.680]   on the basis of repentance and faith,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.920]   not on the basis of Jewishness,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.140]   would need to be justified.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.580]   They would need to be counted righteous,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.160]   'cause they weren't righteous.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.100]   They would need to have a righteousness
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   not their own, as Paul said in Philippians 3, 8.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.880]   And that righteousness included the fulfillment
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   of all righteousness in life, the life of Jesus.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.560]   - Amen.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.000]   - All the righteousness that would be required of men
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.720]   before the court of God, Jesus performed.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.440]   And so he joined fallen humanity
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.600]   for whom he was providing righteousness
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.380]   in sharing their baptism.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.240]   - That is profound.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.000]   And thank you, Bob, for sending in this very simple
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.040]   but profound question as well.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.200]   We are gonna break for the weekend now,
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.560]   and Monday we will talk about free will
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.280]   and how is God sovereign over my free choices?
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.360]   How does that work?
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.280]   It's an important question.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.160]   We get that question a lot.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.440]   And that will be on the table on Monday.
