[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   being attached to the past might be the worst thing that one could do in terms of being
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.540]   able to make good decisions in this context, because if we have a kind of a playbook of
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.060]   what's worked and what hasn't worked, but you actually talk about this, there's a passage
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.740]   in the book that I'll just read it, to be aware of the assumption that the way you work
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.060]   is the best way, simply because it's the way you've done it before.
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.500]   I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes, which is not something I do very often.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.060]   Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.780]   I mean, we want to have mechanisms and routines we can trust.
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.660]   But this is, I think, an important warning.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:58.660]   When something works, it's easy to be fooled into believing that's the way to do it or
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.300]   that's the right way.
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.260]   It's just a way, and it's just a way that happened to work that time.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:17.300]   And this plays into when you get advice from people who have more experience than you.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.940]   You explain your situation.
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.860]   They tell you their advice.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.940]   The advice that they're giving you is not based on your life or your experience, it's
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.220]   based on their life and their experience.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.180]   And the stories that they're telling are based on experiences they've had that have very
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.060]   different data points than yours.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.500]   So maybe they're giving you good advice, but maybe they're giving you good advice for them
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.700]   and not giving you good advice for you.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:01.560]   And it's easy when we try something and have a result, a positive result, thinking everybody
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620]   can do this.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:14.660]   The way I was vegan for a long time, 22 years, and then I started eating animal protein,
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.140]   and then eventually changed my diet a few times to the point where I lost a lot of weight.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.940]   The way that I did it worked for me.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.220]   Right before that happened, I did something that I was told that everyone else who did
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.580]   what you did, they all lost weight for whatever reason I didn't.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.660]   So the idea that we know what's right for someone else, I think it's hard enough to
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.620]   even figure out what's right for ourselves.
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.500]   And if we do somehow crack the code of what's right for us, be happy we have it, and then
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.860]   still know, I wonder if that's the only way.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.500]   Maybe there's an even better way that we're not considering.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.580]   Not to get comfortable with thinking we know how it works, just because we get the outcome
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.140]   we want.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.700]   I was raised in science with a principle.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.140]   It was literally dictated to me as a principle, almost like a rule of religion, which was
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.320]   that the brain is plastic, it can change and learn until you're about 25 and then the critical
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.820]   periods end and that's it.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.980]   And this was a rule, essentially it was dictated a Nobel prize, which was very deserved, given
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.380]   to my scientific great-grandparents, they deserve it.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.300]   But I was told there was no changing of brain structure function in any meaningful way after
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.980]   age 25 or so.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.100]   Turns out that's completely wrong.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.460]   Sorry, David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.460]   Wow.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.460]   That's interesting.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.740]   And so the competition was suppressed because of the competitive nature of prizes and discoveries
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.740]   at that time.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.580]   And a guy named Mike Merzenich and his student, Greg Reckin's own, were showing that adult
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.780]   plasticity exists.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.900]   And only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme, right?
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   Just crazy.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.620]   Like there were so many reasons and the textbook said it, we were all told it, and it changed
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.180]   our behavior.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.380]   Now we know this to be completely false.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.500]   There's plasticity throughout the lifespan.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.060]   There's limits to it here and there, but it's just far and away a different story.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.940]   So why would that be the only time that ever happened?
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.940]   Right, exactly.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.540]   But the field was run by a very small cabal of people at that time.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.220]   All fields are run by a very small cabal of people who have an investment in things being
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.660]   the way they are now because they're in charge.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.140]   And one of the great things about getting older is that, well, fortunately, everyone
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.060]   eventually ages, and I hope that, you know, David, unfortunately, passed away.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.060]   He was lovely.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.060]   Torsten's lovely.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060]   He's still alive.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.740]   And they would say, I think Torsten would say, yeah, we should have been a little more
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.020]   open or kind in allowing these other ideas.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.980]   But I think that- But just think about all the years that were
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.620]   wasted with this misunderstanding.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.100]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100]   And it went beyond that.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.900]   And there were BBC specials that helped propagate this.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.620]   And, you know, one of the goals of the podcast has been to try and shed- shine light on ideas
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.460]   that at first seem crazy, like, I know you and I are both semi-obsessed with the health
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.460]   benefits of light.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.540]   And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.580]   Sounds crazy, right?
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.620]   Sounds like something you would only hear about at Esalen or in Big Sur.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.420]   Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood is based on really amazing
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.500]   work out of Columbia by a guy named Michael Terman.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.940]   The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916, was given for phototherapy for the treatment of
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.900]   lupus.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.500]   Like this idea that certain wavelengths of light can help treat medical conditions is
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   not a new idea.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   But somehow we see a red light.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.740]   We're not used to seeing red lights except in sunsets and on stoplights.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.500]   And somehow it bothers people or it makes them feel like-
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.540]   Until it undermines a business model that doesn't take red light into consideration.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.700]   Right.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   Until it does.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.460]   And then it was- and then it's co-opted there.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.900]   And the place that- what I look to is acupuncture.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.980]   You know, for a lot of years people said, well, acupuncture, this is like no mechanism,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.980]   no mechanism, no mechanism.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.540]   There's a lab at Harvard, a guy named Chufu Ma, who I know reasonably well, whose laboratory
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.940]   is dedicated to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms of acupuncture.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.260]   And they're discovering what everyone has known for thousands of years, which is that
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.640]   incredible effects on anti-inflammation, the gut microbiome.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   So-
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.720]   I have a friend who was having a terrible back problem.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.700]   And I suggested that he see an acupuncturist.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.540]   And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.040]   And his back problem completely healed almost instantaneously.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.980]   And I asked him, you know, have you been keeping up?
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.360]   Because he had another flare-up, he's like, no, I can't go back there because acupuncture
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   doesn't work.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.200]   I said, well, you saw it work for you.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.960]   He's like, yeah, but there's no science.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   Wow.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   He's got it.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   There is- now there's good science.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.200]   And published in premier journals, it- you know, what's interesting is- this is a little
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.680]   bit of science editorial, but since we like to exchange information about health and things
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   of that sort.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.040]   The editorial staff of a journal dictates what gets published and what doesn't.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.400]   And the premier journals have an outsized effect on what the media covers.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.420]   And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now is of the age that they grew up
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.360]   hearing about acupuncture.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.180]   Hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect if it's done right, Yoga Nidra and similar practices.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.140]   And so the tides are changing, but I sometimes like to take a step back and think, what are
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.940]   we confronted with now that seems crazy?
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.420]   That in 10 years, the kids that will be the- because to me, they're kids- will be journal
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.420]   editors.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.500]   I'm like, oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.300]   You know, I'm making this up, but putting tuning forks against your head or something
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.180]   like that, like sound wave therapy.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:28.660]   I think when one adopts a stance of like, we have to filter everything through the limitations
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:35.420]   of our biology, but also through the sociology of like the way culture goes.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.400]   It becomes a different story.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.920]   How do you deal with that?
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.100]   Not just in terms of health, but in terms of thinking about anything.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.900]   Sounds like you don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what people are going
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.900]   to think is cool or not.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900]   No, I can't.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.580]   You're a punk rocker at heart.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.580]   Yes.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.580]   You still are.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.580]   Yes.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.580]   I can't.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.960]   I just know what I like and what I don't.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.300]   I know what works for me and what doesn't.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:05.020]   You know, I try things and I'm constantly looking for new, better solutions to anything.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.540]   And wherever they come from, it doesn't matter.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:13.980]   It could come from Stanford or it could come from the guy talking to himself on the street.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.460]   If it works, I'm good.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.780]   You know, it doesn't really matter to me at all.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.700]   I don't hold any of it tightly.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:31.380]   It's just a matter of time.
