[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.000]   It's Friday and after far too long, Friday means Q&A.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:54.840]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.440]   insight, education and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.720]   also building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.000]   My name is Joshua and I am your host and on Fridays whenever possible, I like to do a
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Q&A show.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.720]   It's been far too long, we missed the entire month of February, but it's March and we're
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840]   back and it's Friday.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.920]   I do love to do these shows because it really helps me to have feedback, direct feedback
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.440]   from my listening audience instead of you being the great amorphous blobby mass out
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.200]   in the hinterbooties.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.040]   I actually get to talk with real people, which I really love and talk about real situations.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.680]   And so I love to do these.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.840]   I want to do them at least weekly.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.440]   I really enjoy them.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.680]   The challenge of course is one technological on my end.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.800]   We missed February as I was working through some changes in my office environment.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.240]   I have to figure out how to make sure that I can be in the right place to do them.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.320]   And then secondarily, making sure that I have enough calls.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.520]   I do restrict these programs to patrons of the show.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.920]   And today we're going to have a great show.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.440]   I've got, it looks like six callers lined up, which is a good balance for a show, but
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   I need more callers.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.200]   So that means I need more patrons.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.880]   If you would like to interact with me on a show like this, I'd love to have you do it.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.440]   And by the way, you can interact with me on anything.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.320]   Sometimes I get angry comments from you guys, comments on the blog and comments where you're
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.160]   frustrated and I always just say, why don't you come and call and talk to me about it?
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.240]   I really would love to do that.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.160]   I love to answer financial planning questions and I love to do it in this context because
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.600]   it's so real, it's personal.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.080]   We can talk about actual situations.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.440]   It's what I love about Financial Talk Radio, but I'm happy to answer your questions on
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.620]   anything in the world that you want to do.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.320]   So if you'd like to join a show like this in the future, come on by at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron and sign up to support the show there and I'd be happy
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   to have you.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.680]   The first caller is Mark in Washington.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.280]   Mark, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.760]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.280]   My situation is that I am unable to get disability insurance.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.800]   My employer does not offer it and my wife and I will be moving to her home country where
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.400]   she grew up.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.960]   I've gone to brokers to find disability insurance, but none of them will make a market with someone
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   who's going overseas.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.840]   The best I got was a five-year term.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.560]   It was a 180-day exclusion.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.120]   It's pretty pricey and they would only pay out for the five years.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   So that did not seem like the long-term plan that I was wanting and it's pretty pricey.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.960]   So I'm wondering your advice on what I can do as an alternative to that if I can't get
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.400]   that disability insurance.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.920]   I know once we move, I will be trying to look into see if I can get that in-country.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.840]   I don't know if that's available or not or if that would be an option.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.040]   That's definitely something to look into.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   But apart from that, what would you suggest I change in our financial plan if I cannot
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.720]   get disability insurance?
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.960]   What is your occupation?
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.480]   So I can't say in a public way.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.360]   It's close to teaching.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.720]   Okay, so something like that.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   Okay, got it.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.000]   Just wanted to make sure you're not, you know, you're working as an oil derrick.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You're going offshore to work on oil, right?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   No, no, no.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's nothing dangerous.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Okay, got it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Fair enough.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.960]   So real quick for the audience's benefit, before we get to your specific situation,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   the very best way to avoid this problem is by getting disability income insurance long
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.320]   before you know of travel plans and especially to get it in the individual marketplace.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.640]   When I used to sell individual disability insurance policies, I would frequently emphasize
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.720]   to my customers and clients that if you own an individual disability insurance policy
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.560]   and if at the time of insurance application you can truthfully state that, "No, I don't
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.080]   have any plans to travel.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.160]   I don't have any plans to change my job," you can be issued a disability insurance policy
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.140]   that is guaranteed renewable to a certain age.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.120]   Usually that age would be 65.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.360]   What a guaranteed renewable contract means is as long as you pay the premiums each year
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.920]   going forward, even if something were to change in your circumstances such as a few years
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.320]   after having the contract, you decided to move to a different country, you decided to
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.120]   change jobs, you decided to pursue a private pilot's license or get a scuba certification
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.400]   or engage in jumping out of airplanes, things like that, as long as you had that policy
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.280]   in force, they can't remove that contract from you.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.620]   It's guaranteed renewable.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.480]   They have to renew it when you pay the premiums.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.320]   That is very valuable.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.300]   It's one of the benefits of owning a policy in the individual marketplace versus owning
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.040]   a policy as part of the group marketplace.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.500]   Now it still needs to make sense financially.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.640]   In the world of insurance, of course, you're thinking forward and you're saying, "Well,
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.240]   I think there will be things that will happen in the future, but I'm not so sure if I'm
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.880]   willing to pay for them today."
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   You still, of course, have to think, "Is this worth it?"
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.260]   But get the policy now.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.360]   If you think 20 years from now or 10 years from now you're going to get rich and you
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.220]   might want to pick up the flying airplanes after you get rich, get the policy put in
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.360]   place today and make sure your policy is guaranteed renewable so that this doesn't happen to you.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.800]   Now, frequently, however, we don't think ahead, which is in the situation where Mark is, or
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   we don't know.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   For all examples, maybe Mark, you had a great group policy.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.520]   It didn't make financial sense for you to have an individual policy.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.120]   Now your job is changing and you're in this circumstance.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.760]   With regard to your shopping, you said you've shopped with a couple of brokers.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.960]   Have they quoted it with the specialty companies such as the subsidiaries of Lloyd's of London
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.800]   and companies like that which do market and make a market for these types of specialized
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   insurance programs?
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.600]   That is a great question.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.960]   They did not give me a policy from Lloyd's of London.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.760]   I don't know if they shopped it.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.040]   I assume if they had, they would have come back to me with a specialty policy like that.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.960]   I did go to a non-captive agent, so I was assuming that they would search all those
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.720]   options, but I do not know for sure that they did search a specialty broker like that.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   Frequently they would.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.640]   So usually the way that this works inside the insurance business is an agent will work
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.320]   with a broker.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.440]   For example, a big one is a broker called DI Broker.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:55.560]   A licensed insurance agent can call up a company like DI Broker and with their relationship
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.880]   with them, DI Broker will shop it out.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:07.280]   When you have specialty insurance cases, they will shop it out to subsidiaries of Lloyd's
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   of London.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.080]   Lloyd's is the name that everybody knows, but they write this type of stuff through
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   some of their subsidiary companies.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.000]   So as an example, a number of years ago I had a client who had a very specialized job
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.280]   as a TV, a part-time TV hostess.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.440]   It's the type of, when you get into a world of acting and entertainment, you can't place
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.720]   that type of policy with a standard run-of-the-mill insurance company.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.200]   Or I had a client who was a nurse and they were planning to move abroad and they were
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   moving to Africa.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.680]   So of course when they know that they're moving, they couldn't get it.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.920]   So I was able to get a quote for them from Lloyd's and from some of their subsidiaries.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.400]   Lloyd's doesn't only insure movie stars' faces and your cheekbones for millions of
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   dollars.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.280]   They do work with normal individual people.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   So make sure that things have been well shopped.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.440]   But let's assume that they have been, because what you will usually find is when you're
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.000]   moving to another country outside of First World, outside of the United States, outside
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.760]   of Europe, outside of these more stable insurance marketplaces, it is often difficult to get
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   the coverage.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.240]   And when they do offer it, they will often control their risk by offering a smaller policy.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.360]   And so what they offered you was a policy with a term of up to five years of payments
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.800]   with 180-day waiting period.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   Is that correct?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   Mark Miller That's correct.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   That's correct.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   Which was not guaranteed renewable.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.000]   Davey So now we have the challenge and it becomes
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.280]   a basic financial calculation where we say, "Is this worth having?"
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.760]   Now if you were to become disabled, Mark, and not be able to work for three years, would
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.200]   that leave you financially destitute in your current financial situation?
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:01.640]   Mark Miller If we had to make it without our social network,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.680]   I would guess we would make it probably in a year and a half before we would need to
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.680]   rely on others.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.920]   However, we do have a really, really strong network.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.280]   And so we would not be destitute in that sense, but we would need to depend on others.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.800]   Davey So philosophically, insurance works best
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.560]   when it covers catastrophic circumstances that can't be protected by other means of
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.560]   planning.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.560]   Insurance works best for those needs, not for relatively predictable day-to-day things.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.880]   For somebody who's financially prudent, there's very little reason for you to take out insurance
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:48.360]   on losing your job because you can solve that problem with maintaining a good marketability
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.620]   in the marketplace and by having savings, having an emergency fund.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:58.680]   But it's very hard to solve for total lifetime disability by having savings.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.640]   It would be an unusual 25-year-old or 30-year-old worker who has the ability where if they were
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.800]   totally disabled and never able to work for the rest of their life to just sit back and
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.100]   live for another 80 years without earning income.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.640]   So insurance works great for those long-term needs.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.080]   Now with long-term disability insurance, when they're offering you a policy like that where
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.040]   they'll only cover you for five years and it kicks in after six months, you're not getting
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:31.120]   that totally catastrophic coverage and you're still self-insuring for a bunch of the risk.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.440]   Statistically, it's very likely that at some point in the next five years, you will be
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.800]   unable to work for a week due to sickness.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.320]   It's statistically relatively unlikely that you'll be unable to work for more than six
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.680]   months.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.840]   But it's dramatically more unlikely that you'll be unable to work for 12 months than it is
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.460]   that you'll be unable to work for 12 years.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:59.640]   So in this situation, my gut instinct is to say if you could make it a year to a year
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.680]   and a half based upon your own financial resources, and then if you have a strong network that
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.960]   you could fall back on, if the policy is what you consider to be expensive, you're probably
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:18.680]   better off just simply putting that money into a larger savings program, into self-insurance,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:26.320]   than you are into buying insurance, especially if you're working in a relatively safe job,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.360]   the actual day-to-day characteristics.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.000]   So I would probably move in that direction, recognizing, look, they're not going to pay
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.440]   me any money for six months.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.160]   If they do pay me money from six months, it's only coming in from six months to five years.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.960]   You can calculate the total maximum benefit of the policy.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.400]   Let's say that they would pay you, and what was quoted to you, what was the monthly benefit
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.720]   and the total maximum benefit of the policy?
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.640]   You know, I was trying to pull that up, and I somehow misplaced the policy.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:03.480]   My recollection was it was roughly 60% of income, which would have been, well, it wouldn't
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   be making 60 a year roughly, and they're going to cover about 60% of that, is my recollection.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.640]   - Okay, so $60,000 a year times .6 comes out to $36,000 per year.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   So times 4.5 years, or sorry, it would be times five years, 60 months of total benefits
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.040]   under a total disability scenario.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.640]   So $36,000 a year times five comes out to $180,000.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.360]   So the total maximum lifetime benefit of this policy is $180,000.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.280]   That's the total it could pay out.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:43.520]   Now take the monthly premium and ask yourself, okay, how long would it take me to save $180,000
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.440]   with the monthly premium and start to run that ratio?
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.240]   There is no mathematical answer.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.140]   This is going to be a gut call from you.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.400]   How likely am I to get disabled?
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.640]   From what you're describing to me, you might make the decision like I recommended to my
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.080]   client in the past, who it was a very similar situation.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.640]   In this case, they were going to work as a nurse in Africa.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:11.040]   We got a policy, but it had a five-year total lifetime benefit, 180-day waiting period,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.120]   and it was expensive.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.320]   And I just said, "I don't think this is worth it.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.040]   I think you're better off setting the money aside."
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.800]   So that's probably where you're going to end up.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.340]   So let me give you some ideas and strategies to protect yourself even so.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.860]   Number one, save money, because the more money you have saved, the better off you are.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.500]   And even if you're saving in things like retirement accounts, etc., save money, because if you
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.460]   have enough to live on for five years, then you've pretty much negated the need for this
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.960]   policy.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.380]   Of course, there's a small flaw in that thinking, because if you had enough saved for five years,
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.660]   this policy could cover you for five years and then your savings could go farther.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.580]   But this is in the range where it's very hard to predict what happens.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.820]   But the more savings you have, the less insurance you need.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.900]   Once somebody is financially independent and able to retire and live on their money, their
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.540]   need for disability income insurance is completely eliminated, because they now are covered by
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.120]   their assets.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.180]   So when you can't get disability insurance, pursue your assets.
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.920]   Look at building your assets.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.220]   Number two, while you're saving, make sure that you are extra careful with all of the
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.540]   simple, common, everyday risk minimization techniques.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:30.460]   When you are going to look out in your yard and you see that your tree needs to be trimmed,
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.620]   hire the guy for $100 to trim your tree instead of you going and climbing up the ladder, because
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.460]   that $100 to hire the guy to trim the tree is going to be a better use of the money when
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:46.580]   you're not spending the $100 on insurance.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.780]   Put on the safety goggles when you are using a saw.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.400]   Wear a helmet when you're on a bicycle.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.600]   Put on your seatbelt when you're in the car.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.420]   When you go skiing, put on a ski helmet, et cetera.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.460]   Just pursue all those safety things and become safety conscious, because many of the things
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:08.440]   that happen to people frequently come due to negligence on their own part, negligence
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.320]   in them wearing proper safety equipment, et cetera.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.300]   So wear and use proper safety equipment.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.040]   If you look at injuries that are likely for your situation, things that would be likely
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.740]   to keep you from being able to work, you may be able to come up with ideas that would help
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.740]   you avoid that.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.420]   For example, if you have a physical job, then a physical back injury would be something
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.540]   that would keep you from being able to perform that physical job.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.880]   If you're in something that's like teaching, a physical back injury, you might be teaching
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.700]   from a wheelchair, but you could teach from a wheelchair.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.340]   But if you had a physical job where the risk is an injury to your back, then focus on strengthening
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.340]   your back.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.540]   Focus on flexibility.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.540]   Focus on good posture.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.500]   Focus on protecting yourself with proper safety equipment, et cetera.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.560]   Good lifting practices, things like that.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.140]   You can minimize your risk substantially even if you don't have insurance.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:06.200]   Then with regard to insurance, look into something to see if there are any small policies that
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.700]   are available to you that are portable, that are with you.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   In the old days, I used to recommend that people purchase something called a long-term
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:20.500]   care insurance cash policy, not an indemnity policy, but a cash payout policy.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.920]   Since I'm out of the marketplace for a few years, I don't know if these are still available.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.060]   In the past, there was only one company that was still selling them when I was actively
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.180]   selling these.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:34.500]   But the idea was that in a case of a severe disability income insurance need, a severe
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.820]   disability need, you might be able to qualify as needing care under the definitions of a
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.700]   long-term care policy.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.620]   In those long-term care policies with a cash policy, they would make the payment to you
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:55.380]   if you satisfied the policy definition for needing care, whereas most policies only compensated
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.100]   you and reimbursed you for actual care expenses incurred.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   So I used to recommend that, but I don't know if that's still available.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.820]   Check with your disability insurance broker.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.460]   Then finally, work on good health insurance.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.980]   Get the best health insurance you can and consider being willing to add some additional
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.700]   bells and whistles to your health insurance policy to cover you.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:21.980]   Those are the risk mitigation techniques that I know of and that I would apply in case of
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.980]   this problem.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.540]   Also recognize, especially if you're traveling abroad, you may be able to negotiate something
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:32.900]   with your actual company for them to cover you in some kind of a private agreement, some
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.780]   kind of private insurance agreement.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:41.380]   So if you were doing work for a specific company and they couldn't cover you under that external
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.380]   policy or they wouldn't buy one for you, you may be able to establish some kind of salary
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.540]   continuation agreement with them, which would provide you and your family an additional
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.100]   level of protection.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.100]   Those are my ideas.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.100]   Mark, anything else that I missed?
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.500]   That's super helpful.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.980]   Are you allowed to say the name of the company that did those long-term care and cash policies?
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.140]   Yeah, I'm allowed to.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.460]   I just have to come up with the name.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.260]   It was a company in Florida.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260]   It was a little company in Orlando.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.780]   The guy that I sold it to was a rancher.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.500]   He faced the problem that his ranch made him enough money to live on, but it wasn't productive
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   enough on paper for him to actually be able to qualify.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.460]   So I sold him this policy, but I warned him.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.900]   I said, "Every couple of years, this company, we need to check on it because I don't know
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.820]   if they're going to still be in business in a few years."
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.460]   Because the numbers didn't work.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.280]   They mispriced the insurance.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.020]   So I don't know the name.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.340]   And if you do buy one of these policies, caveat emptor.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.580]   You need to pay attention because most of these companies went out of business, and
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.580]   that was a major challenge for them.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.580]   But ask your broker.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.140]   That would be a good place for your insurance broker to earn some money.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.140]   That's what they do.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.140]   Brian in Oklahoma, welcome to the show.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.580]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.580]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:13.500]   My question dealt with unquantified and unknown risks that may appear sometime in your life.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:20.260]   And I think about this as I reach middle age and I have got four kids and a fifth on the
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:28.500]   way, whether those risks are things that can just happen in the course of life, some can
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   be insured.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.460]   It's appropriate based on the last conversation you had.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.700]   Some can be quantified and insured.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:40.260]   Some can be quantified and self-insured.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:47.820]   But then there's some that are very difficult to quantify and just the way life is can come
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.600]   at a moment's notice.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:58.460]   And I wonder what you would recommend from how you assess those risks, how you self-insure
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.700]   for those risks or think about dealing with those risks if and when they do occur and
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.780]   where those fit into a larger financial plan.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:14.580]   Because one could say you're financially independent, but I think that that's kind of a farce when
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.460]   none of us knows what will happen tomorrow.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.880]   Right, right.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.340]   So I can think of a couple of examples that your question sparks, but do you have any
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:30.060]   specific examples that you were considering that we can work from?
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   Maybe some could be an unforeseen legal dispute that leads to legal expenses.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.700]   You could have something like a disability of yourself or someone that you love or care
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.700]   about.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.980]   Those are things that kind of come to mind.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.600]   But I think it's anything that's, you know, there may not be an insurance market for this
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:22:00.740]   type of risk or if there is one, it might be prohibitively expensive.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.740]   Or there, yeah.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.740]   So.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.740]   Right.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.060]   So here would be my thoughts.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:15.260]   I think that we should always start by recognizing that we cannot eliminate risk from the world.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.180]   We cannot eliminate risk.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.680]   It's just simply not possible.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.260]   And we cannot guarantee safety.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.860]   One of the biggest kind of political philosophy issues that I have with many modern conversations
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.700]   is people are constantly looking and saying to somebody, "Well, you need to guarantee
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700]   my safety."
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.620]   For example, we look to government and say, "You have to guarantee my safety."
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.800]   Well, government can't guarantee your safety.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.300]   They can try to help and there are maybe appropriate measures for that, but they can't guarantee
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.500]   safety.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.740]   And none of us can guarantee safety or remove risk.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:54.500]   In a sinful and fallen world, that is the natural result of sin is that our world faces
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.660]   difficulties.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.820]   So if you're expecting a child, you have no way to guarantee that your next child is not
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:06.600]   going to be diagnosed from birth with cystic fibrosis or some serious muscular dystrophy
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.740]   and is going to die when they're 15 years old.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:14.500]   We live in a tragic and fallen and sin-filled world with the natural expression of that
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.780]   being risk, catastrophe, storms, etc.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:24.540]   It's impossible to eliminate whether you go from the mundane to the ultimately catastrophic.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.900]   The mundane is a car accident today on the way to work.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.940]   The catastrophic is maybe Al Gore is right and the world's going to burn up in the next
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:39.160]   five years and the entire peninsula of Florida is going to be overwhelmed by a giant tsunami
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.860]   wave from the ocean.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:48.620]   So I think it's first healthy to recognize that it's impossible to eliminate risk and
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.700]   to really deal with that because that's where we come into a question of faith.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.700]   Okay, well, how am I going to deal with this?
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.700]   And of course, many people have no faith and they deal with risk anyway because we're all
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.700]   in it together.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.620]   You can't escape it ultimately.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:08.340]   Second, I think there are some basic techniques that can be applied no matter the risk.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.860]   The first one is stability.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:16.480]   If you're a stable person, emotionally stable, psychologically stable, you have a stable
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.640]   family life, a stable marriage, if you have a stable business, a stable home environment,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.740]   if your finances are stable and on a good ground, your job is stable.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:32.800]   If you're a stable person, then usually you can handle many of those things that come
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.540]   at you.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:42.500]   There's nothing that'll make an unstable person's life worse than a minor catastrophe, but a
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.460]   stable person can usually deal with those things in stride.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:53.100]   I think many of us, even if we're relatively wealthy, many of us can appreciate how stressful
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.260]   it is to have an unexpected flat tire when you have no money, when you're broke, when
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.580]   you're arguing with your wife, your husband, when your child is misbehaving.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.660]   Many of us can recognize how stressful that is.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.380]   Even if it weren't a financial problem, let's say that you're on the road, Brian, you have
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.020]   four children, five children.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.540]   Let's say you're on the road with your four children that are not in their mother's tummy
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.460]   and your children are just at the end of their rope.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.580]   They're tired, they're cranky, everybody's yelling at each other.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.100]   You've just snapped at them and now you have a flat tire.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.520]   Well, that's a really stressful situation taken even more stressful.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.740]   But if you are a stable personality, your children are under control, you've thought
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:43.420]   ahead about their needs being met, their stomachs are not empty, they're not cranky, they're
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.640]   not tired, you've planned when you're going to travel so that you're not pushing the limits,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.900]   you haven't been upset and on edge all day, you're not fighting with your wife, and you
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:59.380]   guys have had a great time, well, the same event can happen, the same flat tire, and
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:05.580]   yet it can be experienced very differently by somebody who's stable and in control.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.340]   And so I think that's very important to recognize that you can't plan for all these things financially,
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.660]   but a stable life can absorb a lot more of these things.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:22.100]   And that's one of the reasons why I prefer to take a lower risk approach to life because
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:29.140]   I personally have experienced and recognized that if I take a lower risk approach to life,
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.140]   it's possible that I won't wind up being as wealthy in the long run with money.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:40.420]   But it seems like there's a very strong argument that I'll have a much more peaceful and happy
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.380]   and joy-filled existence than if I'm always on the edge trying to shoot for the moon,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.680]   living a high-risk lifestyle.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.420]   So stability in every area of life makes a difference.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.180]   Next, stability in terms of money makes a big difference.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:02.420]   You can't, of course, plan ahead for everything, but let's use your example of an unforeseen
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.380]   legal dispute.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.020]   If you think about the legal system, you can't guarantee that you're not going to have a
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.940]   legal dispute, but you can lower the risk of that legal dispute.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.020]   For example, you can make sure that you don't make a practice of drinking and driving.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:25.840]   You can make sure that you attend to the maintenance around your home, or your business, thus making
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.940]   it less likely that you'll be found guilty of negligence in somebody's injury.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.580]   You can think thoughtfully about your finances, and in advance you can study something like
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:41.260]   asset protection, and you can make sure that your assets are sheltered in legally sheltered
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.260]   accounts.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.900]   You can make sure that your businesses are properly set up so that if you have one business
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:52.220]   that goes bad and you suffer a major lawsuit there, that that business damage is contained.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.140]   And you can make sure that you are building yourself and just taking good protection,
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.580]   good insurance.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.180]   That's why something like good liability insurance on your home is important.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.580]   A good umbrella insurance policy is always a good idea.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:12.460]   Those simple risk mitigation techniques have a broad application, and if you think through
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:17.880]   those risks and come with them, they wind up having a few things in common.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   One is savings, two is low debt, three is proper insurance for your stage of life, and
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.000]   four is good proactive planning and basically paying attention in advance, soliciting the
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.940]   advice of experts before you engage in something new and risky, and then minimizing the risk.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:41.400]   Those are the techniques that can be applied to any circumstance in any situation, and
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:46.380]   somebody who's applying those techniques will seem to suffer less catastrophe.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.660]   And if they do face catastrophe, they'll be able to work through it.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.080]   Many people have worked their way through bankruptcy.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.480]   Many people have worked their way through legal judgments that were held against them.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.580]   Many people work their way through, and it's much easier to survive if you're focused and
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.260]   just stable about it.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.500]   One inspiring story, just as an example.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:17.120]   I've always been inspired by the example of one of my grandfathers who was a farmer.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:23.440]   He had a business go bankrupt early in his career because he made a bad decision.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.420]   It was a road construction company that he started.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.820]   He made a bad decision.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.540]   He took a contract without doing proper due diligence, and the contract destroyed all
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.040]   the value of his equipment.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.600]   He finished the job, but it put him deeply in debt.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.700]   His business partner walked away from it, wanting to declare bankruptcy.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.960]   My grandfather chose not to declare bankruptcy, but it took him several decades to pay that
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.180]   money off.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.720]   Throughout the course of his lifetime, he suffered just like what every farmer does.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.080]   Sometimes good years, sometimes bad years.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.640]   He suffered legal judgments.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.420]   Somebody sued them for, I can't remember the details of it, so it doesn't matter.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.700]   Somebody sued them and fighting different things out.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.880]   But just by staying on the basics, he made his way through the loss of that business.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.020]   He maintained the integrity of his family.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.520]   He maintained the integrity of his business, and he worked a long and healthy career.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.680]   He generated and built a beautiful and strong family.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.800]   At the end of his life, he was fairly wealthy because of those efforts.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.280]   Disasters aren't permanent.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:27.240]   We all face them, but by taking a broad approach and thinking about them, we'll be able to
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.480]   navigate through them.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.840]   That's my best answer for you right now, Brian.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   I appreciate that.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.800]   It gave me a lot of good things to think about.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:45.440]   I guess one more thought is people often discount the connectedness of life, but it's really,
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.720]   if you fail in any one area, frequently that'll have a resulting effect.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:58.480]   Somebody who is not careful with their finances will probably, and I have no data to prove
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   this.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.840]   I've not studied this with scientific data, but I have a good sense of what I have studied,
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.400]   and I think this would fit with our common experience.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:13.600]   But somebody who's careless with money is also often the type of person who may be careless
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.000]   with what they put in their body or who may be careless with putting on a helmet before
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.720]   they go and engage in an athletic endeavor.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:26.680]   Carelessness seems to be a character quality that goes in every other area.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.080]   That person may engage in risky sexual relationships with other people.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.040]   That person may engage in risky business relationships with other people without thinking because
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.640]   there's a habit of carelessness.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.840]   Now on the flip side, if you bring in and teach your children the habit and the character
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:51.320]   quality of carefulness as a virtue, and you train them in carefulness with their toys
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.160]   when they're little, and you train them in carefulness with their possessions, and you
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.320]   train them in carefulness with the money they earn, and you train them in carefulness with
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.800]   their moral integrity, and you train them in carefulness with the relationships that
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.760]   they're engaging in, that has a spillover effect into other areas of life.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.560]   Frequently, people try to diagnose one problem without taking it in an integrated way and
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.900]   saying what's the virtue, what's the character quality that's necessary?
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.800]   And if you'll teach that character quality, the person can frequently figure it out.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.480]   But if you just teach the technique such as, "Hey, here's how you save money," and don't
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.440]   teach that virtue, that character quality, I think the actual chance of success is severely
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   diminished.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.040]   Ross in Washington, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   Hi, Josh.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   We really appreciate the show.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   We're a family of seven.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   We've recently paid off all our debt.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   We maxed out 401(k) out.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   I'm fairly new to investing.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   I'm trying to figure out what strategies I want to apply.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   We're really leaning towards dividends.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   We're in index funds right now.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   And I guess I'd just like to know how I would get started, books, growing capital, and
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   all that stuff.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   I'm a little bit of a gambler.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   I'm a little bit of a gambler.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.040]   I'm a little bit of a gambler.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   I'm a little bit of a gambler.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   I'm a little bit of a gambler.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:08.120]   You currently are invested in index funds, and the idea is how would I identify the best
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   strategy for me?
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.920]   Is that a good summary of your question?
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.600]   So multiple answers to this.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.920]   The first thing, of course, is to learn.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.240]   Learning is inexpensive.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.840]   Lack of learning is very expensive, but learning is inexpensive.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:28.400]   And there's never been a better time to learn about a subject like investing in the history
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   of the world.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.960]   There's never been a better time.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.120]   There is so much information available for you with no cost.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.600]   So I would start by pursuing your area of interest.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.080]   If your area of interest is dividend investing, there are many good dividend investing blogs
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.040]   written online by competent, qualified people, some of whom I've had on the show in the Archives
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.200]   of Radical Personal Finance, which is search dividends, and you'll find some past shows.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   There are many qualified people who host podcasts specifically on dividend investing.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.920]   If you go on YouTube, you'll find information specifically on dividend investing.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   First thing I would – next thing – or first or next thing I would do concurrently,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.960]   I would go down to the library and I would look through all the books on investing and
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.400]   I would check out about a dozen of them on dividend investing, and I would perform an
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.440]   overview of the reading in that area.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.360]   If you've never read it, if you've never read consistently in an area like dividend
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:29.520]   investing, then I would start by just reading one or two books, but then I would read systematically
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.960]   and start to understand what are the themes, and I would challenge myself with that information
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.760]   to say, "Okay, what is it about dividend investing that I like?"
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.040]   List the benefits of dividend investing.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.360]   List the disadvantages of dividend investing and try to understand what is it about dividend
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.200]   investing that I like.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.600]   If you sit down and you read about a dozen books on something, pretty much you'll put
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   yourself in a situation where you understand the different approaches to that subject.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:08.880]   My little aphorism that I really love that I think is important is spend as much time
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.600]   learning about a subject – sorry, spend as much time learning about an investment
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.480]   as it takes you to earn the money that you're going to put into the investment.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.840]   You do the math, but if you're going to engage in a certain investment strategy, you
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.200]   want to know the risks and the disadvantages.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:33.160]   This type of reading is called syntopical reading, which means to go and to understand
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.160]   a whole field.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.200]   If you are going to engage in dividend investing, I would say that that's a good way to do
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   it.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.560]   Now, balance, of course, the learning versus the doing.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.500]   Some people get paralyzed by learning and they never get to the doing.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.880]   Some people just jump into doing and they learn by losing money.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.400]   I think there's a good balance there.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   I don't know how you can figure out how to advise yourself there, but if you're listening
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   to a couple of podcasts on dividend investing and you're reading about dividend investing
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.120]   and you're reading articles on it and you're talking with other people who've done it that
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.200]   you've interacted with in an online forum on dividend investing, now you're starting
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.120]   to understand it.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.800]   Challenge yourself to know the pros and the cons.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:24.040]   My next piece of advice would be come back and survey your particular skills, your particular
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:31.440]   situation, your particular goals, and understand why is this approach to investing appealing
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   to me.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.240]   Let me give you an example.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:39.820]   I don't have much interest in dividend investing, but it's not because there's anything wrong
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.820]   with it.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.820]   It's not convinced.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.760]   It's a perfectly valid strategy.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:50.000]   But for me, I don't enjoy the idea of studying individual companies that are publicly traded.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.200]   I don't think I have any special unique skill in that area.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:00.040]   I would either just follow the advice of somebody that I've chosen to or pursue some other investment
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   strategy.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   It doesn't really appeal to me personally because of my personal goals.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.120]   But there are other people who take a great deal of interest in it and it's exactly the
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.520]   opposite.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.680]   But understand the risks and the problems with it.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:20.120]   In my mind, you should be able to defend your investment strategy and say why it's good
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.800]   and why it's good for you.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:27.840]   You should also understand the shortcomings, the disadvantages of that strategy, and understand
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.520]   how to know if those disadvantages are affecting you or not.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:40.480]   So learning, reading syntopically is really valuable to make sure that you're well-equipped.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.240]   Once you have mastered the basics, and let me give this back.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:52.120]   So there's a school of education called the classical educational model.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.800]   And there's a famous essay that is often referred to as a starting point for people who are
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.360]   interested in the classical education model by Dorothy Sayers.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.960]   It's called The Lost Tools of Learning.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   There's an audio recording of it in the archives of Radical Personal Finance, a standalone
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.440]   audio recording of Dorothy Sayers' essay called The Lost Tools of Learning.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:16.360]   But in that essay, she presents the idea that children learn in different stages.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.040]   There's a grammar stage, a logic stage, and then a rhetoric stage.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   This is not her idea.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.280]   This is classical education.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.880]   This is the three foundations of the trivium of classical medieval educational philosophy.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   The trivium and the quadrivium.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.080]   And the trivium has really come to be very popular in classical educational circles.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.840]   But the basic approach is that you learn the grammar of something first, which is you learn
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.840]   the words.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.840]   You learn what the words mean.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.400]   You learn the basic concepts.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.200]   Then a child, and so that would be perhaps a primary school child, and then the child
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.800]   should move on to logic.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.120]   And so a young brain is not prepared to deal with logic, but a middle-aged or middle school
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.160]   type of brain is prepared to deal with logic.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.920]   And then the third stage is rhetoric.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.160]   Rhetoric of speaking about it, talking about it, defending it, et cetera.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.280]   Well, I think that's a natural approach to apply to any kind of self-learning that you're
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.080]   trying to apply.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.880]   You start with grammar.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.660]   You learn what the words mean.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:20.520]   You learn the basic ideas about a subject without judging it, without trying to say
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.520]   what's wrong.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.680]   You just learn what those arguments are.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.400]   Learn what those words mean.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.920]   You can apply this to dividend investing.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.320]   You can apply this to how to become financially independent.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.460]   You can apply it to a political topic, a religious topic.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.920]   You learn the definitions of the words.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   And that's the best way to do it is to start with a couple of books where you'd actually
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.520]   read them carefully.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.640]   Then you move on to the logic stage where you start to interact with the ideas and you
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.280]   start to say, "This particular person is defending dividend investing because of this simple
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.600]   example.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.220]   Companies that pay dividends pay out more money.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.200]   You get richer investing in companies that have dividends."
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.720]   The logical problem is, is that true?
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:07.540]   And of course, the answer is not necessarily because it's a logical fallacy to only look
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.160]   at dividends and not to look at total return.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.120]   And so then you come back to the issue and say, "Well, my goal is to become financially
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   independent.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.560]   And so the only way for me to become financially independent is to spend dividends."
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.040]   But that's actually logically untrue.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.760]   Even if you're 50 years old and you're living on dividends, you could just as easily live
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.720]   on the sale of the actual securities.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.120]   In fact, from a tax perspective, the dividends are somewhat tax inefficient, whereas the
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.820]   sale under long-term capital gains taxes can be more efficient.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.400]   So you now recognize I have to look at total return.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.200]   I can't just look at dividends because I can actually spend total return.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.440]   And it's not that I can only spend dividends.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   So thinking through it logically.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.640]   And then rhetoric would just be teaching others in this case.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.160]   But the key is study the subject first with grammar, understand the words, understand
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.440]   the concepts, understand the meanings, and then start dealing with the logic and then
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.840]   apply it to your particular life.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   That helpful, Ross?
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.840]   Any follow-up questions?
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.840]   No, great.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   Thank you.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   Cool.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   Thank you for listening.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   And good job on getting out of debt.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.600]   I hope that you continue to make incredible progress.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.120]   All right, next.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   He's off.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   Let's go to Kevin in California.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.800]   Kevin, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   How can I serve you today?
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.720]   So I'm trying to figure out what's the, I guess, most efficient way or best way to
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.280]   fund a land purchase.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:37.120]   And I was planning on using my equity in my home, whether that was like hard equity or
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   appreciation or whether to just do a refinance or just a flat-out new loan for the land itself.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.860]   So what are your thoughts?
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.280]   How much is the value of your personal home?
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.840]   A little over 400.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.480]   And how much is the current value of the mortgages on the property?
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.640]   I owe 230.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   So you have $170 of equity available in the home?
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.600]   Yes, give or take.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.960]   And the land purchase would be how much?
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.480]   Roughly 80.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.200]   And do you have any savings that you would plan to apply for or are you planning to finance
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.520]   the entirety of the purchase?
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.160]   I guess that's part of the crux of what I can't decide on.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:25.800]   I have a taxable investment account that I could easily purchase the land with.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   That would incur a taxable event and I don't know if that's the most efficient way to do
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   it.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.720]   Whether I can just use a loan to purchase it.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.760]   What's the game plan for this land?
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.000]   What are you hoping to accomplish by buying it and investing in it?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.160]   To build the long-term home.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.040]   So the idea is you'd buy this land, you'd build a house on it, and then you'd sell the
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.440]   house that you're living on right now and move to this new house that you'd plan to
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.440]   build?
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.920]   That's one option, either to sell this house or rent it out because it's in a pretty desirable
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.680]   neighborhood and a nice little town.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   What's your timeline?
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:10.000]   Well, the land's on the market now and I guess not too long, I guess.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.120]   But if you buy the land, when would you build?
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:17.040]   Would you build 10 years in the future or would you start building next year?
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.520]   Oh, probably within two to three, be completed.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   So this is fairly quickly.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.440]   And how much would you be paying for the home?
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.280]   Sorry, how much would it cost you to build the house?
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.360]   I'm guesstimating $350 to $400.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.720]   $350 to $400, okay.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.240]   How much money do you have outside of the equity in your house that you'd be willing
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.240]   to spend on the project?
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:52.440]   I'd probably be able to cut with another $100 pretty easily.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:58.180]   Have you shopped mortgages, interest rates, any of that stuff at this point in time?
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.180]   Very little.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:04.640]   I know I think the rates I've seen are around like 4.25 or 4.1, something along those lines.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.440]   What's the rate on your current mortgage?
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.880]   Three and a half.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.680]   So the first thing I would do is based upon this information, I would try to get clear
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.640]   on my different options, which perhaps you've done this, but just in terms of my own thinking
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.900]   process as I try to answer your question.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:33.400]   So I would look at it and I would say, option A, I can use the cash investments that I have.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.760]   I'm just going to say, pretend I sell them, the investments that I have, $100,000, and
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.400]   I can buy the land with no mortgage.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.000]   Then you list down on that, what does that cost me?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.960]   The cost of that is of course the tax liability that you now incur on the sale of those assets.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.520]   So you have to calculate that in.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.600]   And then the benefits of that is I can move quickly and I'm not taking out more debt.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.420]   I'm not paying interest.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.320]   So you would calculate those numbers and get clear on it.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.520]   As you're considering whether you should sell those assets, you need to look and say, what
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.740]   do I expect to happen with these investment assets?
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.080]   Is this probably a good time to sell?
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.160]   Is this not?
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.040]   You don't want to hang on to an asset that should be sold simply because you have a tax
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.240]   liability.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.120]   Sometimes it's good to go ahead and sell and take the tax liability.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.160]   On the other hand, you don't want to sell an asset that, an investment asset that you
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:36.880]   think has a lot of room to run and really has a strong future, even if you might need
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   the money now.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.520]   You're not going to hold it until you do that.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.120]   So you're going to have to look at that and say, what's best for me there?
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.080]   Say option A is to sell the assets and pay cash for the land.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.720]   Then the question is, where can I get the money to build the house from?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.060]   And in this case, you would investigate, would I take a construction loan?
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.640]   Would I pay for it out of cash flow?
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.520]   Look to see, do I qualify for a construction loan?
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:07.160]   If I did qualify for a construction loan, would I qualify for a refinance of that construction
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.880]   loan to a traditional mortgage?
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.000]   And check those numbers.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.160]   Ask talk to some mortgage brokers and look to see what those costs would be.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.020]   In addition, then, look at the home equity line of credit and figure out what would be
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:25.120]   available for you in terms of how much money could you take out on a HELOC, under what
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.220]   terms.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   And then talk to a mortgage broker and see if I refinanced my primary mortgage, how much
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:36.680]   could I take out from that primary mortgage if I refinanced it and what would be the rates
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.760]   at that primary rate.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.960]   And so lay out your options, A, B, C, D. Calculate the costs of each, calculate the benefits
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.840]   of each, and factor those into your overall plans.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.600]   If your overall plan is you want to wind up in a situation where you're going to own both
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:02.120]   of these houses, one you're living in, two that you're renting, then try to think through
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.680]   what would be the best situation to be in when you get there.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:13.560]   My guess, without that numerical data, is it's probably a good time and a good way to
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.440]   go ahead and refinance your primary mortgage now.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:25.280]   If you refinanced your primary mortgage now at the highest amount possible and you put
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:31.720]   it on the very long fixed interest loan, that would free up cash for you right now, which
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:37.940]   you could use for the purchase of a home, and would put in place financing that could
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:44.080]   be maintained should you, two or three years from now, go ahead and rent the house out.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.960]   The challenge is affordability.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.680]   If you're going to build something, how much cash flow do you have?
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   Will you be able to swing it?
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.240]   Will you be able to make payments if you make a construction loan or however you're going
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.640]   to finance that second house in terms of making the transition?
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.800]   If you do that, make sure, of course, that you wouldn't be violating your mortgage by
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.280]   getting a mortgage by having it on a house that you could rent out.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:09.960]   My guess is it's a whole lot easier for you to go ahead and refinance now on your primary
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.840]   house when it is still your personal residence, rather than trying to get financing on it
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.200]   as a rental.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.920]   Since this is an idea that's a few years out, it would seem to me that you probably could
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:26.460]   go ahead and do that refinance since there's no specific plans.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:30.760]   You can go ahead and answer all the questions appropriately that, "Yes, this is my primary
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   residence."
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.280]   The only challenge, of course, would be the cost of interest.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:39.000]   You'll have to calculate current interest rate versus new interest rate.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   That's how I'd approach it.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Was that helpful?
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Yes.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.840]   Actually, I have one kind of spawned question from your answer.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.560]   Instead of doing a construction loan or something along those lines, do you have any thoughts
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.880]   on taking out a loan against your own account?
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.600]   Have you heard of that process?
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.400]   Taking out a loan against your own investment account?
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   Yes.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.760]   That's collateral, I guess.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.640]   I get very scared about that, depending on how it's structured.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:15.880]   I get very scared because, depending on the investment, are any of your investments leveraged
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   currently?
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.880]   No.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.120]   Are they derivatives or are they direct securities?
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:28.200]   It's just Vanguard index funds.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.440]   That's simple, of course.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.320]   I don't want debt against my investments.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:40.160]   I'm not sure that I couldn't be persuaded that, as a form of bridge financing, that
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.200]   there aren't a couple of tactical ways to do it, but I'm certainly not going to do it
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.120]   as a long-term scenario.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.600]   Here's why.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.840]   If I take out debt against my investments, I was different.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.120]   That's why I ask about what kind of investment it is.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:02.240]   If you have an account where you're trading derivatives, then it's not, depending on what
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.840]   you're actually investing against, you can get into some things where your account could
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.600]   go to zero without too much trouble.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:14.200]   It's a little hard for a Vanguard index fund to go to zero because there's so many companies
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   involved.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.920]   There's so much involved, but you should always be prepared with stocks, a pure stock portfolio.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.720]   You should always be prepared for your account value to decline by 50%.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:30.080]   That will happen at some point during a normal average investment lifetime, if the past is
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.840]   any indication of the future.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   You don't know when it can happen.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.640]   You don't know how fast it could happen.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:43.880]   The problem is, if that happens while you're in a vulnerable situation, everything becomes
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.400]   worse.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.520]   If you are using that account and using that financing, and you're putting yourself in
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:56.400]   a situation where you're using that financing with a margin account on your investments,
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:01.240]   and you're using that to pay for your real estate, and you're depending on your cash
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.440]   flow to get you through, well, if there's a 50% decline in the market, that means that
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.620]   there's something really bad happening in the business environment.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.480]   Something that's really bad happening in the business environment could have a spillover
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.120]   effect which could freeze up other forms of real estate financing, as we can remember
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.460]   10 years ago.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.240]   In the same time, your job may be at risk, and you may take a pay cut, or you may get
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   laid off.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.120]   Now, you're stuck in a real bind where your investments are down by 50%.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.600]   They have to be sold at a loss to cover your loan.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.520]   You can't refinance your real estate, and now you're stuck all the way around.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.360]   I don't want to be stuck all the way around.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:41.160]   I'd rather play it more conservatively and limit the number of moving things that can
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.160]   be moved.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:50.480]   I'd rather sell my assets and take the tax penalty, or pay the tax, incur the tax, especially
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   if there's a gain.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.660]   You're only paying a tax if there's a gain, and the gain is a good thing, and then use
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.100]   that to go and pay for the house.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:02.340]   The second reason I hate debt, and I hate it in these cases, is it's very easy to wind
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.100]   up overspending.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.240]   It's much easier to spend more than you should.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.140]   That's the basic thing, problem with debt.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:16.420]   You go into it saying, "My budget is $350,000," but all of a sudden when you're in it, you
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.800]   start thinking, "Well, we'd like to have some upgraded fixtures.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.660]   We'd like to have the nicer roof instead of the cheaper roof.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:26.980]   We'd like to have these things," and all of a sudden you're in it for 425 or 450.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.740]   Then you've got cost overruns, and things get out of hand, and now you're in it for
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.820]   550.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.540]   That's not unusual.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.060]   That's not an unusual story.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:41.300]   By doing it with minimal debt or constrained debt and not putting yourself in a precarious
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:46.100]   position, I think you play the safe game, and I think the safe game leads to the happy
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.100]   life.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.100]   Agreed.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:55.700]   I guess one quick final question is, would you consider doing a show about financial
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.900]   planning or state planning for parents with special needs children, or is that already
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.100]   in the hopper by chance?
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:06.060]   I have needed to do that show for a very long time.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.060]   I'm intending to do more financial planning shows.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:15.140]   The challenge is, the reason I haven't done it so far is simply financial planning shows
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.300]   are the least popular with the audience as measured by audience engagement and downloads.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:25.700]   They're also the most time-consuming for me, and they have the most limited me to create,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.940]   and they have the most limited audience.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:35.300]   It's kind of hard as a show host to say, "I'm going to spend 10 hours, a dozen hours to
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:41.460]   sit down to create this free podcast that I'm going to put out with very limited revenue
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:46.660]   either from an advertisement placement or something like that, with very limited revenue
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:52.900]   potential for that podcast and for me to put 12 hours into preparing a one-hour show that's
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:58.340]   careful, that's precise, that's concise, that's reasonable, that's well-structured, and then
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:03.860]   to not have the audience really engage with it."
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:09.140]   It's a lot easier and more beneficial from my perspective as a business to sit down and
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:13.300]   say, "Well, let me just rant and rave about something off the top of my head," which will
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:18.700]   have big audience engagement, and it's easier for me to do with 15 minutes of preparation
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.740]   instead of 12 hours.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:25.540]   Over the last year, I've really lost my previous momentum with financial planning shows, and
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.700]   that's why I haven't done it thus far.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:32.060]   I want to do it though because I really want to serve the careful financial planning market,
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.620]   but what I've been trying to solve behind the scenes has been the problem of the follow-up
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.380]   item.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.580]   So I want to do a show on it, but I want to have a follow-up.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.940]   I need to have a follow-up sales, something to sell as a follow-up for people who are
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.380]   interested in the show.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:54.260]   So if I create, let's say, a three-hour lecture on special needs, and then I release the first
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:55:00.820]   hour as a free podcast, but hours two and three can be purchased for X number of dollars
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.540]   by anybody who's interested in the subject and who's interested in it, and I have a few
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.220]   interviews lined up with some special needs experts, things like that, now I have a business
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.980]   case for doing more careful financial planning, technical financial planning stuff.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.180]   So that's why I haven't done it so far, but I do intend to do it, and that's the direction
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.180]   that I'm going.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:24.240]   So keep an eye on the podcast feed, and hopefully it'll be coming your way as soon as I can
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.020]   make it happen.
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.860]   It's not that I want to do it.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.420]   I just got to figure out how to do it in a way that makes sense.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.840]   In the meantime, if you have special needs children or if you want to talk to me about
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.820]   something specific regarding special needs, feel free.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.620]   I'm always available for phone consulting at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.780]   Matthew in Tennessee, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.

[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.160]   Matthew, Matthew.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.840]   Okay, no Matthew.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.000]   Ram in Michigan, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   How can I serve you?
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Ram Ramachandran Yes, Joshua.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   I have a quick question.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Actually, I'm looking for shopping around for a mortgage loan.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.800]   I'm a first-time home buyer.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:20.160]   So somehow I, I mean, somehow I learned based on the internet or whatever, if I do continuous
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:26.300]   shopping with different bankers on my mortgage loan, there is a chance that my credit score
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.400]   may go down.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:35.560]   And by having this kind of fear, I'm a little reluctant to go and shop around.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.560]   And I mean, I don't know how can I, without shopping, how can I get a best interest rate?
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:45.440]   I have a very good credit score right now.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:51.680]   So I mean, I'm a little confused how to shop around and get the best interest rate.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.120]   So I need your help here, please.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   Okay.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.080]   Where are you in the home buying process?
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:01.680]   Have you already chosen a home or are you in the pre-choosing process?
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.120]   I did not choose the house.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:10.240]   I just approached a couple of real estate agents and they asked me to go and talk to
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.280]   the bankers and get the pre-approved for a mortgage loan.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:20.480]   So I'm in the process of finding a mortgage lender and getting my loan pre-approved.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.480]   Right.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:27.640]   So the normal process is for, in terms of this kind of shopping process, the normal
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:35.120]   process is you need to have the actual property in place before you do the final shopping.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.040]   But of course, a real estate agent wants to know that you're not just kicking the tires,
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.500]   that you actually are willing to buy.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:47.560]   And also, if you're making an offer with financing, they're going to need to submit that offer
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.960]   to the seller of the house with the property.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:58.040]   So the best, the normal way to approach this is to find a mortgage broker that will work
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:01.520]   with you with a number of different lenders.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:06.960]   And that mortgage broker will then pre-approve you for a certain amount.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.780]   Let's say, I don't know what you're shopping for, let's just say $300,000.
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.960]   So they'll pre-approve you for that $300,000 amount.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:19.920]   They'll say yes, based upon the credit score, the information here, $300,000 is no sweat.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:25.720]   Now when you go out and are looking at properties, your real estate agent now knows that you
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.220]   are legitimately qualified for a $300,000 mortgage.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.160]   And then of course, they'll show you properties in that range.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:38.200]   When you go to submit an offer on a property, let's say you find a property for $200,000,
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:45.520]   then frequently you'll have your mortgage broker provide for you a pre-approval letter
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.720]   that has a much lower amount.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.620]   You don't want to submit a pre-approval letter with the offer that says that you're qualified
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.780]   for $300,000 when you're offering for $200,000.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:59:02.240]   So they'll go ahead and that broker will provide for you a new letter that's saying that if
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:07.440]   you'll just simply, that you're qualified for $205,000 or something like that.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.920]   That's all part of the game.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.280]   So you'll usually pick one broker to work with in that context.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:21.360]   Now once you have the actual offer on the property, and once the property is accepted,
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:26.440]   once the property is accepted, the offer is accepted, then in that situation you will
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.200]   be able to go ahead and start shopping for a loan.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:35.560]   It's not until you actually have the property and then working with the mortgage broker
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:39.540]   that you lock in the loan that you actually have the final deal.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:45.500]   So in terms of the shopping process, you're a little premature to go around and have everybody
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.680]   start pulling credit reports because that can indeed cause you problems.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:55.000]   But what I would do is I would try to find somebody locally that maybe work with you
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:04.880]   and give you a good deal, and then find research talking with your real estate agent and others,
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.280]   and go ahead and talk with them and see do they recommend.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.960]   You might want to get an offer from your bank, you might want to get an offer from one of
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.880]   the online places, and you might want to work with somebody locally.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.080]   But usually my experience has been that they're really pretty competitive.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.720]   A good local broker that has multiple banks that they work with will usually be pretty
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   competitive.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.440]   And unless you have a strong relationship, say with a local credit union or with a bank
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.040]   that you have a strong relationship with, and you know they're very competitive in the
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:38.960]   marketplace, usually it seems like most people are best served by working with one independent
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.040]   broker who works with multiple companies.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.720]   When you get to that situation, it's less my experience and knowledge, and if anybody
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.800]   knows differently feel free to jump in, but my experience and knowledge is that your problem
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:01.920]   is primarily going to be whether the broker wants to work with you and have you shop with
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.160]   them and shop with them and shop with them, not so much about the actual hard inquiries
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.280]   on your credit report.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.800]   Because there is some hand-holding in this process, frequently local brokers will say,
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.280]   "Hey listen, you either need to pick because I've got these 10 companies I can place these
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   loans with, or you need to pick."
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.360]   When you're actually going to the point where you're actually submitting the applications,
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.040]   things like that, those hard inquiries aren't going to cause that big of a problem.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.720]   They're going to look at all the other metrics and your credit score.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.120]   Okay, I got it.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.840]   So another one simple final question, Joshua.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:49.280]   So let's say if I go and get the pre-approval loan from some lender, and then I'll tell
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.840]   to my real estate broker, the agent, that okay, I'm good with the pre-approved loan.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.960]   So he'll go and show a couple of properties for me, and I'm interested in one.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:03.400]   So once I decide to purchase a property, that time can I go back and shop around again one
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.360]   more time with different people, and then I can go with different lender after?
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:14.600]   Because let's say somebody else is giving me a better interest rate, that time can I
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.480]   ignore this pre-approved loan and move on to a different guy, or I have to stick to
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.880]   this pre-approved guy?
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:28.280]   No, that'll be, you can absolutely do it, you can absolutely work with different people
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.040]   even up until the loan is finalized.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.080]   So you can absolutely work in a competitive environment.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.640]   The challenge is simply figuring out how to do it.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.780]   Because if you're working with three people online, then it's relatively simple.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:47.560]   But a lot of times if you're working with a local mortgage broker, then they're already
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.100]   involved in that shopping process.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:58.520]   So my observation has been there's not going to be that much variability in rates.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.000]   It's a pretty standardized market, and what can happen is because the rates could change
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.840]   frequently, your biggest risk is the actual rates changing across the industry, not so
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:19.480]   much which particular company happens to have the very cheapest.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.520]   They're very competitive, at least that's my observation.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.080]   >>Steve: Okay, I got it.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.580]   >>Adam: And then one last tip for you, make sure that if you haven't listened to it, go
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:32.500]   back and listen to episode 305 of the show called Mortgage Credit Certificates, the coolest
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.360]   mortgage interest credit you've never heard of.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.800]   That show is all about the mortgage interest credit, and that is a program where you'll
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.880]   have to investigate to see whether your state offers it, and you'll have to investigate
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.760]   to see whether you would qualify, whether your property qualifies for it.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:57.200]   But that is one of the unique focuses, the unique questions that comes up.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.480]   If you do qualify for the mortgage credit certificate, you've got to go ahead and make
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.280]   that happen early.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.440]   And then also go and listen to episode 318 of the show, which is all about how to get
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.200]   the best possible mortgage as well.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.040]   Matthew in Tennessee, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040]   Let's try you again.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   Are you with us this time?
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   >>Matthew: I am.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040]   >>Joshua: Very good.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.040]   How may I serve you, sir?
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   >>Matthew: Thank you for taking my call today.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.800]   So my question is around content creation.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.600]   When you have a breadth of knowledge in an area, especially one that is nuanced, how
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.220]   do you create content without going into all the nuance every time?
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.600]   If you were to create a show with all the nuance, it would be like four hours long every
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.760]   time because that is how unique each situation can be.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.120]   So my question is, how do you know when it's time to stop on a particular subject and just
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.800]   ship the show?
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.720]   >>Joshua: You are – that is probably the biggest softball setup that – which we didn't
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:58.120]   plan – anyone has ever offered me to cover one of the most difficult things that I am
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.040]   often challenged to figure out.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   So here's my thought.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.480]   Number one, it's hard.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.520]   And especially that's been a hard lesson for me.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:15.360]   Because when I started Radical Personal Finance, I wanted to provide the depth because I couldn't
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.240]   find the depth.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.760]   And I'll share this just from my own experience.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:27.800]   I used to listen to Dave Ramsey or Clark Howard or Rick Edelman or other people as well.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.440]   And when they'd answer a question, they would answer the five-minute question and I would
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.080]   be so frustrated because I'm like, "You missed everything.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.400]   You could do this, this, this, this, this, this, this."
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.240]   And when I first started, I had a big chip on my shoulder.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.080]   I'm going to show them how much better it is.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:50.360]   Well, what I've learned is that there's a method to their methodology.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:56.520]   And I now look at – now with almost four years of experience, I now look at Dave Ramsey
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.400]   and I understand why he does what he does.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.680]   And I feel like I was ignorant before of how effective he is.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:09.880]   Because by keeping it simple, he actually moves people to action.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.640]   And the people who don't want simple are not his audience.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.600]   But there's a much bigger audience of people who want simple who he can serve.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.600]   And what today I look at it and I used to be frustrated by and say, "Man, why doesn't
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.760]   this guy answer the question actually fully?"
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.960]   Today I look at that and I say, "I need to be more like Dave Ramsey because he moves
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.440]   people to action and he does it by keeping simple."
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.520]   And it's been very hard for me to learn that lesson, but it's also a very real lesson.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:45.360]   And so my thought on it – and the other thing has been that it has to do with personal
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   confidence.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.600]   I think a few years ago, I probably had more of a desire to show everybody how smart I
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.160]   was than I do today.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.800]   I was less confident.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:00.560]   And so as somebody who knows something about a subject, I often have had the desire to
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.780]   rebut every rebuttal.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:07.400]   And this used to tie me up in knots because I would sit down and I would create this concept,
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:12.760]   okay, concept A. And I know that in concept A, the way my brain works, I already know
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.440]   the rebuttal arguments to my presenting concept A are rebuttal one, rebuttal two, rebuttal
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440]   three.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.160]   And so I would go ahead and say, "Well, the rebuttal to rebuttal one is rebuttal A1,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.360]   A2, A3 and rebuttal."
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.680]   And I would create these things.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.800]   Well, then it becomes an absolute monstrosity.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.760]   And you lose people and no one wants to listen to a two-hour explication of concept A, rebuttal
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.380]   one, answer to rebuttal one, two, three, et cetera.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.680]   And so the audience, well, not no one, the audience that wants to listen to that is very
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.280]   small.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:50.040]   And I've realized as I've become more confident as a broadcaster that if I want to serve people,
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:57.040]   I have to offer content in different ways and in different ways.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.500]   And I have to recognize that some people aren't going to like the way I offer other content.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:09.000]   And so what I am desiring to do in the future, what I'm not doing as well as I want to do,
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.680]   is I'm desiring to have more variety to reach more people.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.960]   But the cost of that variety is annoying some people.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:24.040]   And it's very difficult for me to be okay with that because I personally am a people
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040]   pleaser.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.300]   I want to make everybody happy.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:32.760]   But by way of example, I recently did a show on the example of why I hate pickup trucks.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.040]   And it was caustic.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.380]   It was very unusual.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:40.340]   I said the word idiot more than I've ever said in my life.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.400]   It was not my normal tone.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.340]   And I knew that it was a risk when you write satire and use hyperbole, that's a risk because
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.860]   some people may not understand it.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.480]   But when looking at it, I said, "This might cut through."
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:56.540]   It might cut through to somebody who really wants it.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.280]   It might provide some additional entertainment value.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.320]   It is a real concept and I can try something new.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.200]   I got all kinds of people who are like, "Joshua, you were such a jerk.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   You're so arrogant."
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.920]   And I'm like, "Do you not listen to the rest of the show?
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:17.480]   Do you not recognize that this is something different and unusual that I'm making a point?
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.240]   But do you not recognize this?"
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.200]   But of course, if I label it as, "This is out of the ordinary," then it removes all
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.540]   of the power and the punch of it.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:33.200]   So what I think it is, what I currently try to do is I'm currently trying to say, "How
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.560]   can I package things in different ways for different people?"
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.640]   I want to create something that in some cases is one minute, is five minutes.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.740]   In some cases, it's five hours.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.080]   And to have different things for different people and let people choose because the person
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.440]   who's really interested in a subject will dig in, let's say, five minutes, 50 minutes,
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.600]   and five hours.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.080]   The person who wants the five hours will also enjoy the five minutes and the 50 minutes.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:03.240]   But if everything is five hours, if everything is over the top, people aren't going to be
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240]   able to tune in.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.280]   Many people are going to say, "I can't listen to five hours," and they'll skip it.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.000]   So it happens to all of us.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.940]   We have a podcast and if every podcast is two hours long, then sometimes you have two
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.880]   hours and you want it and sometimes you have five minutes.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.920]   So I believe that the value is just recognizing that for the person who really needs the concept,
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.640]   they'll dig it through.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:31.340]   But if you just do one thing, you'll miss out on impacting as many people as you want.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.160]   So it's been hard for me to learn that.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:38.360]   It's been hard for me to learn to just be okay with people being mad at me, to be okay
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.520]   with the fact that someone's not going to understand, to be okay that when I go into
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.920]   an esoteric subject, someone's going to get all ticked off because I'm talking about guns
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.960]   or I'm talking about this.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.360]   Just learn to be okay with it and say, "Listen, you listen if you want, you don't listen if
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.360]   you want.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.800]   You're an adult.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.720]   You have a thumb that works.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   Use it.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.800]   But in the meantime, I'm not going to be dissuaded from what I'm trying to do because I'm worried
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.000]   about your nasty message."
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.920]   It's not an easy question to answer.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.280]   Got it.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.400]   When you first started Radical Personal Finance, did you have a sense of responsibility in
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:27.440]   that you were concerned that maybe somebody would come by that podcast and make an incorrect
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440]   decision?
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440]   Now, mind you, it is free.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.320]   So to the individual listeners of Radical Personal Finance or any podcast, they should
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.800]   understand it's not a response tailored exactly to their situation and should treat that accordingly.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.320]   But at the same time, did you have a sense of responsibility at the beginning that, "Gosh,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.720]   I hope that I'm nuanced enough that if somebody comes by, this is actually..."
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.640]   Because depending on how you take personal financial advice, something can be completely
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.720]   wrong in your unique situation and you just may not be, for lack of better wording, may
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.120]   be ignorant to that.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.600]   Did you have that at all when you were starting Radical Personal Finance or does it exist
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600]   today?
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.620]   Or is that something where you said, "I'm just creating a free show and it's their responsibility
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:15.440]   to follow up further to get their perspective on their unique situation?"
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:21.040]   I've always felt that responsibility because when I started, I was a long frustrated financial
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:28.800]   advisor, angry that my clients would spend more time listening to another financial pundit
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.840]   and they didn't ask me for the specific application of what they were doing.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:39.340]   And that was one of my deep abiding frustrations that a client would listen to something that
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:44.240]   somebody on the radio said and they would say, "Well, this must be true."
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.880]   But the person on the radio was lacking the context of this particular situation.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:56.340]   And almost any financial decision could be right or wrong to the degree that there is
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:00.720]   objective right and wrong based upon the individual circumstances.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.040]   And it used to drive me nuts, especially as a long-term...
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.220]   I'd sold a lot of insurance policies over the years.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:14.900]   And it used to drive me nuts when somebody would give what I perceived to be careless
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:20.200]   advice on life insurance policies or disability insurance policies or long-term care insurance
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.840]   policies.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.820]   That really frustrated me.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:29.540]   And so the way that I tried to handle it was to say, "Let me talk about how to get from
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.600]   here to there."
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:37.440]   And even when I do the Q&A shows, as I've done in this particular show, what I try to
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.920]   do is whenever I'm answering a question, not to say, "Do this," but to say, "Here's the
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.080]   process of how I'm approaching it, how I'm analyzing it.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.500]   And then based upon this method of analysis, here's the answer that I'm coming to."
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:14:00.060]   And that's my hope is that that'll help people to think about the method of analysis while
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:05.000]   picking up a few tips and not just simply go straight to the end answer.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.400]   That's my personal hope.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.840]   Now successful or not, I don't know.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:15.280]   I've certainly tried to pull back on some of the intensity of that method of analysis
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.640]   because there's only a small, very, very small number of people who are actually that interested.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:27.200]   And I love to serve those people who are deeply interested, but I also have intentionally
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:34.120]   tried to pull back on the level of detail and to just be a bit more to the point so
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.280]   that my ideas will be impactful on a broader audience.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.600]   >>JAMES: You got it.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.640]   Thank you for taking the time to answer that.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.080]   >>DAVE: Thank you for the nice softball question.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.360]   It's always nice when somebody sets it up and says, "Here's a fun question.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   Talk about yourself."
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.240]   It's a great example for the final teaching moment so that it's not all about me.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.800]   It really is a great example of the value of asking people about themselves.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:10.080]   If you want to be a good friend, I mean, I do the show, but it's very hard for me to
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:16.280]   want to talk about myself and what I'm learning and struggling with if someone doesn't ask.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.480]   And so the same thing can be applied in social situations as we all try to be better listeners,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.800]   engage with people by just asking them about themselves.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.000]   One comment, I'm going to release this as a...
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.480]   I'm going to kill the music.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.800]   I'm going to give you a bonus speech, which I'm going to...
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.080]   In that line, I'm going to put the bonus speech here, and then I'll probably cut the audio
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.440]   and release it later.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.040]   But here's what I want to say.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:44.360]   You are an adult.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.820]   Act like one when it comes to what you listen to.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.120]   That means multiple things.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   Number one, it means you actually have to listen to what somebody is saying.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.480]   This seems to be a skill that we have frequently lost, lost more and more in our culture.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.520]   But listen to what somebody is saying.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:09.720]   Don't automatically assume that because they're saying X, then they obviously must mean the
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.720]   antithesis.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   But listen to what somebody is actually saying.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.920]   Two, listen widely, but recognize that you're listening voluntarily.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.080]   When somebody's saying something, don't get mad and write to them and say, "I can't believe
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.600]   you're saying such and such."
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.280]   At least engage with their content.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:33.560]   When I say things that I think are helpful and valuable, I'm saying them because I think
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:38.500]   they're helpful and valuable, not with an intentional goal of making you mad.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.520]   I don't care if you're mad.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.440]   I don't care if you're happy.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.680]   What I care is that you engage with the substance of what I'm saying.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:52.720]   And it's really amazing to me how many emails and comments and things I get from people
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:58.000]   who are frustrated because I said something they didn't like, but they actually didn't
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.760]   deal with what I said.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.400]   And it almost feels like an epidemic in our culture.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.800]   So recognize this.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.920]   I'm not asking you to listen.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:15.480]   I'm hoping that I can serve you, but if at any point in time I stop serving you, just
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.520]   stop listening.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:24.280]   That is your right as a human to walk away and disengage.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.280]   Don't send me an email saying, "Well, I just can't believe you said such and such, and
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.680]   that's it, and I'm out."
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.280]   That changes my mind not a bit.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.800]   I'm not stupid.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.480]   I know when I say something that is controversial that it's controversial.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.680]   If you want to make me think, rebut what I'm saying.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.960]   Just don't come by the blog page and write a comment saying, "Well, I just can't believe
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.480]   you said that because that was so offensive."
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.680]   Come by and say, "Joshua, you're wrong," and make an argument.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.480]   Make an actual argument about why I'm wrong.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.680]   Present your evidence, present your facts, present your reasoning, and argue why I'm
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.120]   wrong.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.440]   When I get an email from you writing to me about why I'm wrong, I sit and I read it
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:15.600]   very carefully, every single line, every single word, and I consider your perspective.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.480]   I put myself in your shoes, and I stop and I think, "Okay, based upon how this person
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:26.280]   is communicating, what's the merit of their argument?"
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.440]   I consider your argument.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.640]   When you write to me saying, "I just don't like your stuff," I usually respond back and
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.480]   say, "There are lots of other good podcasts."
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.080]   But please, don't waste your time.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.760]   I want you to go and get what you need.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.480]   If I can't deliver that, I'm fine.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.480]   Go.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.480]   I believe in the free market.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.200]   I believe in the freedom of information.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.560]   I believe in the freedom of ideas.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.160]   So go and find somebody.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:57.480]   But you're not going to change my mind unless you actually make an argument.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:03.760]   We've created a culture where being offended all the time is a badge of honor instead of
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.000]   a culture that loves truth.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:15.040]   In the last decade of my life, I have changed many, many things that I believed.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:21.800]   But I've changed them based upon argument, not based upon offense.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:27.460]   The mark of an adult is being able to listen to somebody that you find offensive or being
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:35.200]   able to listen to an argument that you disagree with and consider it on the merits of the
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:42.880]   argument, not just simply based upon the fact that you disagree with it or you find it offensive.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:50.040]   If we can't do that and we can't think, then we're doomed.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:58.920]   And unfortunately, if my email inbox is any reflection of that, we're doomed.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:05.960]   So I beg of you, if you want to argue me on a point, argue it with me.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:11.120]   But don't tell me how mad you are because of something I said.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:16.440]   You don't have a right to not be offended.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:26.280]   You don't have a right to control what shows up voluntarily in your phone and on the internet.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.040]   You do have a right to simply stop listening.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.440]   And you do have a right, of course, to say what you believe.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:39.800]   So if there's something that you believe that you think disagrees with what I believe, feel
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.840]   free to argue it with me.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.480]   Or please use your freedom of speech.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.420]   Start your podcast.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:48.600]   Start your blog.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.520]   I will help you do that.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.400]   I've done that to many people who say, "I just don't really like radical personal finance."
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.840]   Great, I will help you.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.640]   I'll help you start a podcast.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:07.520]   I'll help you start a blog that disagrees with me because I believe in truth.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:18.120]   And I believe that a vigorous debate about concepts and ideas has value and is a method
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.640]   of arriving at truth.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:25.200]   It's not the only method, but it is a method.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.240]   If there's something that I'm wrong in, tell me I'm wrong.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.120]   I will read your comment.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.360]   I'll read your argument.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.640]   I'll read your email.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.880]   I'll read that very carefully.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.640]   And I'll follow your logic.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.180]   I'll consider what you have to say.
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:46.880]   My only request is if you have any interest in understanding what I have to say and why,
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.960]   then feel free to do the same thing.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.800]   But don't waste your time telling me how offended you are.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.560]   It doesn't change my mind.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.840]   Thank you for listening, for allowing me to get that off my chest.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.400]   With that, I wish you all the best.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.480]   Thank you for listening to today's show, You Radical You.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.960]   Before you go, I have one question for you.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.880]   Was there an idea in today's show that helped you?
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   Were you inspired?
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   Were you motivated?
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.840]   Did you get an idea on how you can earn more or spend less money or invest more wisely
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:26.440]   or perhaps protect yourself from catastrophe and insulate yourself from financial disaster
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.440]   or just improve your life and your lifestyle?
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.560]   Well, if so, I have three requests for you.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.760]   Number one, take action.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.760]   Listening doesn't improve your life.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.640]   Doing, however, can revolutionize your life.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.400]   Number two, take the idea or concept that you learned from me and go and teach somebody
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.600]   else.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.280]   If you want to really learn something, go and teach it to others.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.720]   That ripple effect of you to someone else will systematically transform your life and
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.960]   the lives of all those around you.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.640]   Number three, if you thought there was financial value in what you just heard, I'd ask you
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.680]   to come by and pay for it at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.120]   Now however much you want to pay, that's up to you.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   But if the show is worth a dollar a month, come by RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.280]   and sign up to support the show at a dollar a month.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.400]   If the show is worth $20 a month to you, I'd be happy to have your $20.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.000]   Hey, if it's $1,000 a month, write me a check.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.200]   Don't send it to me on Patreon, but I'd be happy to have that as well.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.120]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron is where you can do that.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   Thank you.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120]   Hey, parents.
