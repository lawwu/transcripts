[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Do you see a connection between World War II and the crisis we're living through right
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.080]   now?
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.080]   Sure.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.600]   The need for collective action, reminding ourselves of the fact that all of these abstractions
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.320]   like everyone should just do exactly what he or she wants to do for himself and leave
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   everyone else alone.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.320]   None of these abstractions work in a global crisis.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.120]   And this is just a reminder that we didn't somehow put all that behind us.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.140]   When I hear stories about my grandfather who was in the army, and so the Soviet Union where
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.760]   most people die when you're in the army, there's a brotherhood that happens, there's a love
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760]   that happens.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.200]   Do you think that's something we're going to see here?
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200]   A sense of community?
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   Well, we're not there.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.600]   I mean, what the Soviet Union went through.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.360]   I mean, the enormity of the war on the Russian doorstep, this is different.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.880]   What we're going through now is not...
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.120]   We can't talk about Stalingrad and COVID in the same breath yet.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.440]   We're not ready.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.280]   And the sort of, you know, the sense of like the great patriotic war and the way in which
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.580]   I was very moved by the Soviet custom of newlyweds going and visiting war memorials on their
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.580]   wedding day.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.280]   And on the happiest day of your life, you have to say thank you to the people who made
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.820]   it possible.
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.260]   We're not there.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.560]   We're just restarting history.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.280]   I've called this, on the Rogan program, I called it the great nap.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.260]   The 75 years with very little by historical standards in terms of really profound disruptions.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.260]   And so-
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.280]   When you call it the great nap, you mean lack of deep global tragedy?
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.680]   Well, lack of realized global tragedy.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.360]   So I think that the development, for example, of the hydrogen bomb, you know, was something
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.320]   that happened during the great nap.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   And that doesn't mean that people who lived during that time didn't feel fear, didn't
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.580]   know anxiety, but it was to say that most of the violent potential of the human species
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.040]   was not realized.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.240]   It was in the form of potential energy.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.600]   And this is the thing that I've sort of taken issue with, with the description of Steven
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.120]   Pinker's optimism, is that if you look at the realized kinetic variables, things have
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   been getting much better for a long time, which is the great nap.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.880]   But it's not as if our fragility has not grown, our dependence on electronic systems, our
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.380]   vulnerability to disruption.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.940]   And so all sorts of things have gotten much better.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.760]   Other things have gotten much worse, and the destructive potential has skyrocketed.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.880]   Is tragedy the only way we wake up from the big nap?
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.760]   Well, no, you could also have jubilation about positive things, but it's harder to get people's
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   attention.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.520]   Can you give an example of a big global positive thing that could happen?
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.240]   I think that when, for example, just historically speaking, HIV went from being a death sentence
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.120]   to something that people could live with for a very long period of time, it would be great
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.600]   if that had happened on a Wednesday.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680]   Like all at once, you knew that things had changed.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.040]   And so the bleed in somewhat kills the sort of the Wednesday effect, where it all happens
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880]   on a particular day at a particular moment.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.920]   I think if you look at the stock market here, there's a very clear moment where you can
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.120]   see that the market absorbs the idea of the coronavirus.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.720]   I think that with respect to positives, the moon landing was the best example of a positive
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.080]   that happened at a particular time.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:51.440]   Or recapitulating the Soviet American link up in terms of Skylab and Soyuz, that was
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.480]   a huge moment when you actually had these two nations connecting in orbit.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.680]   And so yeah, there are great moments where something beautiful and wonderful and amazing
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.200]   happens.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.280]   But it's just there are fewer of them.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.920]   That's why as much as I can't imagine proposing to somebody at a sporting event, when you
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.400]   have like 30,000 people waiting and she says yes, it's pretty exciting.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   So I think that we shouldn't discount that.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.560]   So how bad do you think it's going to get in terms of the global suffering that we're
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.600]   going to experience with this crisis?
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.320]   I can't figure this one out.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.680]   I'm just not smart enough.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.120]   Something is going weirdly wrong.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.640]   They're almost like two separate storylines.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.480]   In one storyline, we aren't taking things nearly seriously enough.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:54.560]   We see people using food packaging lids as masks who are doctors or nurses.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.240]   We hear horrible stories about people dying needlessly due to triage.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.560]   And that's a very terrifying story.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.160]   On the other hand, there's this other story which says there are tons of ventilators someplace.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.840]   We've got lots of masks, but they haven't been released.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.000]   We've got hospital ships where none of the beds are being used.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.320]   And it's very confusing to me that somehow these two stories give me the feeling that
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.360]   they both must be true simultaneously, and they can't both be true in any kind of standard
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   way.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.720]   I don't know whether it's just that I'm dumb, but I can't get one or the other story to
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   quiet down.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.960]   So I think weirdly, this is much more serious than we had understood it.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.800]   And it's not nearly as serious as some people are making it out to be at the same time,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.540]   and that we're not being given the tools to actually understand, oh, here's how to interpret
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.980]   the data, or here's the issue with the personal protective equipment is actually a jurisdictional
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.800]   battle or a question of who pays for it rather than a question of whether it's present or
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   absent.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   I don't understand the details of it, but something is wildly off in our ability to
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.160]   understand where we are.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.760]   - So that's policy, that's institutions.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.800]   What about, do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of people that have lost their
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   job?
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.360]   Is this a temporary thing?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.000]   I mean, what I'm, my ear's not to the suffering of those people who have lost their job or
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.280]   the 50% possibly of small businesses that are gonna go bankrupt.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.040]   Do you think about that quiet suffering?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.520]   Well and how that might arise itself?
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.240]   - Could be not quiet too.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.080]   I mean, it could be a depression.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.320]   This could go from recession to depression and depression could go to armed conflict
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   and then to war.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   So it's not a very abstract causal chain that gets us to the point where we can begin with
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.480]   quiet suffering and anxiety and all of these sorts of things and people losing their jobs
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   and people dying from stress and all sorts of things.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:10.360]   But look, anything powerful enough to put us all indoors in a, I mean, think about this
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.520]   as an incredible experiment.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.560]   Imagine that you proposed, hey, I wanna do a bunch of research.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.320]   Let's figure out what changes in our emissions profiles for our carbon footprints when we're
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.880]   all indoors or what happens to traffic patterns or what happens to the vulnerability of retail
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.000]   sales as Amazon gets stronger, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.600]   I believe that in many of those situations, we're running an incredible experiment.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.680]   And am I worried for us all?
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   Yes.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.320]   There are bright spots, one of which is that when you're ordered to stay indoors, people
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   are gonna feel entitled.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.440]   And the usual thing that people are going to hit when they hear that they've lost your
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:06.040]   job, there's this kind of tough love attitude that you see, particularly in the United States.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.600]   Like, oh, you lost your job, poor baby.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.120]   Well, go retrain, get another one.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.240]   I think there's gonna be a lot less appetite for that because we've been asked to sacrifice,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.080]   to risk, to act collectively.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.760]   And that's the interesting thing.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.500]   What does that reawaken in us?
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.200]   Maybe the idea that we actually are nations and that your fellow countrymen may start
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.520]   to mean something to more people.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.440]   It certainly means something to people in the military.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.720]   But I wonder how many people who aren't in the military start to think about this as
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.840]   like, oh yeah, we are kind of running separate experiments and we are not China.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.720]   So you think this is kind of a period that might be studied for years to come?
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.040]   From my perspective, we are a part of the experiment, but I don't feel like we have
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.880]   access to the full data, the full data of the experiment.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.480]   We're just like little mice in a large...
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.760]   Does this one make sense to you, Lex?
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.180]   I'm romanticizing it and I keep connecting it to World War II.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.480]   So I keep connecting to historical events and making sense of them through that way
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.200]   or reading The Plague by Camus.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:25.480]   Like almost kind of telling narratives and stories, but I'm not hearing the suffering
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.800]   that people are going through because I think that's quiet.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.420]   Everybody's numb currently.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.320]   They're not realizing what it means to have lost your job and to have lost your business.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.480]   There's kind of a...
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:49.400]   I'm afraid how that fear will materialize itself once the numbness wears out.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.960]   And especially if this lasts for many months, and if it's connected to the incompetence
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:03.440]   of the CDC and the WHO and our government and perhaps the election process.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.960]   My biggest fear is that the elections get delayed or something like that.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:18.440]   So the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or damaged in some way that then mixes
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.400]   with the fear that people have that turns to panic, that turns to anger, that anger.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.360]   - Can I just play with that for a little bit?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   - Sure.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.000]   - If in fact all of that structure that you grew up thinking about, and again, you grew
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.200]   up in two places, right?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:43.720]   So when you were inside the US, we tend to look at all of these things as museum pieces.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   Like how often do we amend the constitution anymore?
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.280]   And in some sense, if you think about the Jewish tradition of Simchat Torah, you've
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:11:02.000]   got this beautiful scroll that has been lovingly hand drawn in calligraphy that's very valuable.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.960]   And it's very important that you not treat it as a relic to be revered.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.340]   And so we, one day a year, we dance with the Torah and we hold this incredibly vulnerable
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:21.920]   document up and we treat it as if it was Ginger Rogers being led by Fred Astaire.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.880]   Well, that is how you become part of your country.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.800]   In fact, maybe the election will be delayed, maybe extraordinary powers will be used, maybe
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.200]   any one of a number of things will indicate that you're actually living through history.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.640]   This isn't a museum piece that you were handed by your great-great-grandparents.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:49.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:59.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.200]   you
