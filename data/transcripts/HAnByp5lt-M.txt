[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Hello again, and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John with longtime pastor and author
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   John Piper.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.120]   Today we have a question about John Piper's bestselling book, Don't Waste Your Life, and
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.000]   it comes to us from a listener named David.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.300]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.160]   Like so many others, I thank God for your labors and his word to bring clarity on a
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.360]   wide range of biblical topics.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.000]   My wife and I listen to the vast majority of Solid Joyous Devotionals and Ask Pastor
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380]   John episodes, and we have learned a great deal from each of them.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.760]   Over the years I've pondered Galatians 2.20.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.720]   It appears to teach that the person I was in Adam is dead, and the risen Christ is now
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.280]   doing the living in my earthen vessel.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.380]   Would this be your understanding also, and if so, might it be appropriate to modify your
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.420]   book title to Don't Waste His Life?
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.820]   In what sense is the life we now live really a calling for his full life to manifest through
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.140]   us and to break through our limitations and doubts and fears?
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.300]   What would you say to David?"
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.140]   I would say, "Yes, yes, yes."
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:16.220]   When I say to Christians, "Don't waste your life," this means don't waste Christ's life.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.540]   That is, in fact, what I mean.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.060]   So yes, I didn't make the connection, so thank you.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.300]   I didn't make the connection with Galatians 2.20 like you did, but that is exactly right.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.980]   Let me read it so people are up to speed with what we're talking about.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.700]   Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:45.140]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me, and the life I now live in the
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.700]   flesh," paradox there, "I no longer live," and then he says, "The life I live."
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.420]   There's some sense in which he's not living and Christ is living instead, and another
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.620]   sense in which, "Oh, I am living," but what does he mean then?
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.080]   He says, "And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.380]   me and gave himself for me."
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.940]   There's the fundamental truth about a Christian.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.900]   When we, by faith, are united to Christ, we are first united to His death, Romans 6.5,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.300]   if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.820]   Him in a resurrection like His, and then, since our old, rebellious, unbelieving selves
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:42.360]   died with Christ in union with Him in His death, we're made alive by the Spirit to walk
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.880]   in newness of life, Paul says.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.700]   And David is emphasizing that we think of this newness of life as Christ living through
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.740]   us so that all our life becomes a display of Christ.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.740]   That's good.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:08.300]   So, let's look at some other texts and see how that works itself out.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.580]   Stay in Galatians for a moment.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.900]   We were at 2.29.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.180]   Let's go to 5.24.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.260]   "Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.460]   So, what dies in union with Christ is old passions and old, destructive, sinful, Christ-dishonoring
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.460]   desires.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.660]   That's how we show Christ now—new desires.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.740]   His desires start to rule.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:44.300]   And then again, 6.14, "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:54.180]   Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I have been crucified to the world."
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.020]   So, being crucified with Christ means that we are not any longer slaves of the world.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.020]   We're free.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.580]   We're not just echoing, conformed to, mirroring the standards of the world, which means the
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.460]   power of sin is broken.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.180]   Romans 6.7, "One who has died has been set free from sin.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.220]   So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus."
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.580]   This is how we live the life of Christ.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.060]   We live in victory over the sin that He died to defeat.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.980]   Or here's the positive way of saying it in Romans 6.13, "You have been brought from
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.820]   death to life, so present your members"—that is, your arms and legs and tongue—"present
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.100]   your members to God as instruments of righteousness."
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.420]   I think "instruments of righteousness" is another way of saying visible manifestations
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.700]   of the way Christ lived righteously in the world.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.500]   Another way Paul says it is that if we suffer for Christ, "we carry in the body the death
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.900]   of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may be manifest in our bodies."
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:27.400]   So there it is, real clear, the life of Christ shining out, manifest in our suffering bodies.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.740]   Still another way is to use the imagery of the aroma of Christ.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.740]   Paul says, "Thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession through
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.900]   us and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him everywhere."
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.260]   We are the aroma of Christ.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.140]   I think that's another way of saying our life is Christ.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:02.340]   When people spiritually smell our ethos, our attitudes, our actions, when they sniff spiritually,
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.660]   what they smell is the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and to
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.620]   those who are perishing.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.140]   So don't waste the aroma of Christ, which you are.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.280]   And another way he talks about it is in 2 Corinthians 3.18.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.020]   This is how we actually look like Christ.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:31.380]   We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.440]   the same image from one degree of glory to another, for this comes from the Lord who
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   is the Spirit.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:47.540]   In other words, the more we see Christ clearly in the Word, the more we are changed into
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.580]   His image, and the more our life becomes His life for others to see.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.580]   So we don't waste our lives by looking more and more like the world.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.960]   We try not to waste our life by looking more and more like Christ, seeing Him more clearly,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.760]   knowing Him more deeply, and so coming closer and closer to His image in the world.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.560]   One last way Paul talks about our living the life of Christ and not wasting the life of
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.760]   Christ in us, Galatians 3.27.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.580]   And then again, same thing, Romans 13.14, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.320]   provision for the flesh to gratify His desires."
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.720]   Or Colossians 3.10, "Put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.200]   the image of its Creator."
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:08:04.840]   So Paul thinks of Christ as our new uniform, insignia, badge maybe, put on Christ, what
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:14.220]   we put on or wear as a covering or a badge or insignia not only covers us but becomes
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.680]   our new identity, our appearance in the world.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.840]   And this appearance of Christ we must not waste.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.580]   Maybe one last question.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.860]   How do we live this new identity?
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.960]   Not I but Christ in me.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.360]   Just two quick pointers.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.280]   Galatians 2.20 says we live it by faith.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.000]   The life I now live, I live by faith.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.560]   And Romans 7.4 says we live it by the Spirit.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.240]   It goes like this, "It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me, and the life
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.200]   I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God."
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   So the conscious appropriation of the new life is by trusting Christ.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.260]   But then Romans 7.4 says, "You have died to the law through the body of Christ so that
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.520]   you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.560]   may bear fruit for God."
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:16.080]   We have died to the law that held us captive so that we may serve in the new way of the
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.440]   Spirit, not the old way of the written code.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:28.840]   In other words, once we thought willpower law-keeping was the key to life, but we died
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   to that.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.000]   We died to the law in that sense.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.520]   And now the key is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit way.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.220]   And the way he's active in us is by faith.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.680]   This is the new way of the Spirit.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:53.160]   So the sum of the matter is, when we are saved, we are united by the Spirit to Christ.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:01.000]   Our old self—unbelieving, rebellious, loving-sin self—dies with him.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:11.240]   Our new self is created by the Spirit through faith, and the image of that new self is Christ—Christ
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.320]   himself—from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.120]   So yes, David, yes, don't waste his life.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.680]   Don't waste Christ's life in you is good theology, and you can change the title of
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   my book if you want.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   All right.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.560]   "Don't Waste Your Life" or "Don't Waste His Life," whatever your preferred title,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.640]   you can download the book right now free of charge at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.660]   The whole thing can be found there as a PDF.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.160]   If you prefer a printed copy, two new editions were recently released, I think a year or
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   a year and a half ago.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.800]   A gift edition hardcover especially is worth checking out, and then a new design of the
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   paperback.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Both of those are at Amazon.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   Check them out.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.840]   Well, what does it mean to live like a slave of God compared to living as a son of God?
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.000]   Oftentimes we make a mistake here, and we fail to live in the beauty and the freedom
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.160]   of what it means to be a child of God.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.960]   So how do we know if we are living like a slave or living like a son?
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.680]   That's next time on Wednesday.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.800]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.920]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
