[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:37.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.160]   Hi, everyone.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.460]   Today, our special guest is Rob Berger.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960]   Rob was a litigating attorney in a previous life.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.280]   He received his JD from Boston University in 1992
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.800]   and worked as a litigator in the securities industry
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.840]   and the technology industry.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.520]   In 2007, he started a website called
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.480]   doorroller.net, which received tens of millions of visitors.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.600]   After selling that website in 2018,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.480]   he became a Forbes deputy editor.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.500]   And he published a book called Retire Before Mom and Dad.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.700]   Rob is now the host of the Financial Freedom Show.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.740]   He publishes in-depth, detailed reports
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.580]   on all of the free technology and low-cost technology that's
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.380]   out there to investors on his website, robberger.com.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.260]   And he has also started a website
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.860]   for credit cards and banking called allcards.com.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.620]   With no further ado, let me introduce Rob Berger.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.040]   Welcome to Bogleheads Uninvesting Podcast, Rob.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.980]   Rick, thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.140]   It's really great to have you on the podcast.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.140]   You and I have known each other for many years.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.140]   And I know that you've interviewed me a few times.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.660]   And now it's my chance to interview you.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.340]   But I've just always been amazed at all of the information
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.380]   that you put out and have been putting it out
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.820]   for 15 years, a long time.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.620]   Before we get started on where people
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.300]   can find that information and what you've done,
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.180]   could you give us a little background on who you are?
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.720]   How did you decide to get into this line of work?
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.140]   Because it's not what you always did.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.140]   So I was a lawyer in Washington, DC.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.940]   And at the time I started my first personal finance site,
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.820]   I was actually an enforcement attorney
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.580]   at the Public Company Accounting Oversight
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.540]   Board, which regulates the auditors of publicly
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.180]   traded companies.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.340]   And I'd been investing for 20 years.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340]   And I was very interested in really all aspects
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.180]   of personal finance.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.980]   And I said to my wife one day, I'm
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.620]   kind of bored with the practice of law.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.380]   What should I do?
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.580]   She goes, well, get a hobby.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.820]   Out of that came a personal finance blog
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.380]   that at the time was just sort of a hobby.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.180]   I enjoyed thinking about these issues, writing about them.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.860]   And over a number of years, it turned into a business.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.780]   I ended up retiring from the practice of law.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.820]   Then I did some work at Forbes.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.900]   I published a book, "Retire Before Mom and Dad."
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.820]   And it ended up selling my original sites.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.980]   And I've started new ones and a YouTube channel.
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.500]   And now I'm talking to you.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.820]   So you were a lawyer.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.140]   You were a litigator.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140]   You started the website.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.220]   And the name of the website was Dough Roller.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.140]   Did that for 11 years.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.060]   And then you also became a Forbes deputy editor.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.060]   Yeah, so it kind of happened how life sometimes opens doors
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.500]   that you're not expecting.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.820]   So I had sold Dough Roller.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.820]   I sold Dough Roller and the Dough Roller Money podcast
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.260]   and a couple of other sites in 2018.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.860]   And literally just a few days after that,
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.780]   I went up to New York.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.340]   I'd been a contributor at Forbes.
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.300]   Actually, by the way, thanks to you,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.180]   you introduced me to Janet Novak.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.780]   Oh, okay, thank you.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.980]   Right, so really this is all your fault.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.820]   Okay.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.100]   So we were up on Forbes Fifth Avenue location in New York.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.100]   And it was for contributors.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.740]   And I just talked to Janet afterward.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.140]   And I said, yeah, by the way, I sold Dough Roller
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.220]   and the next day she calls me and says,
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.500]   we wanna start something called Forbes Advisor.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.100]   Will you be the managing editor?
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.900]   And at the time I thought I'm retired.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.820]   I don't know what I'm gonna do,
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.340]   but I had no plans to keep working.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.100]   And it just seemed like a fun thing to do.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.180]   So I was the managing editor.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.700]   My plan was to do it for a year,
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.380]   get it up and running and turn it over to someone else.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.540]   I ended up doing it for two years
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.460]   and turning it over to some folks
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.580]   who I think are just fantastic.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.420]   Well, that's great.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.260]   That's a great story.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.460]   I'm glad I could help out.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.580]   I didn't realize that you became a deputy editor at Forbes.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.100]   Now you have a website called robberger.com
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100]   and you also have a financial freedom show on YouTube.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.980]   And you have another website called allcards.com
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.460]   and that a website is about credit cards.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.220]   And you must be working 80 hours a week.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.260]   Well, it's not quite that bad.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.700]   Sometimes it feels like it.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.580]   So they're each sort of their own little thing.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.820]   So my idea with All Cards,
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.500]   and I have a couple of people that helped me with that site,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.460]   I wanna come up with sort of a database of credit cards
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.100]   and bank accounts primarily that folks can go to
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.580]   and they can kind of see everything that's available
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.100]   rather than just a select few
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.060]   that you get from most credit card or banking sites.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.460]   You can basically just about everything.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.020]   And that's taking some time,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.620]   but fortunately I've got a lot of help.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.220]   And in some ways it's just been kind of a thing that I do
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.700]   that's kind of fun 'cause it involves some programming,
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.180]   nothing sophisticated for sure,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.540]   but the YouTube channel is probably
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.860]   where my heart is right now.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.980]   And the truth is, I come up with a topic,
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.100]   I hit record, I record the video,
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.380]   if it's not a live show and I publish it.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.140]   There's no editing, there's no...
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.900]   I can have a video done and published in an hour.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.940]   I might do some research
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.500]   depending on what the topic is ahead of time.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.900]   I've had some great folks on.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.420]   I had Bill Behnken earlier this week,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.940]   who's the father of the 4% rule.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.820]   That was a fascinating conversation.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.300]   I don't know if you know Harold Vinsky,
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.500]   but he's sort of the father of the bucket strategy,
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.140]   which Christine Benz talks a lot about at Morningstar.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.380]   I had him on Wednesday.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.340]   That was a fascinating conversation.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.260]   - By the way, it was a really interesting video with Harold
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.700]   and I'll get to it in a minute,
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.740]   but you were also a competitive chess player.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.620]   So I wanna hear about that.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.220]   - Yeah, it turns out I'm not a very good competitive player.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.060]   - Okay, okay.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.180]   - Yeah, I've played chess since college
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.180]   and in my less lucid moments,
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.540]   I think I could become a master,
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.900]   which would be a rating of 2,200,
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.340]   but it's just over 2,000
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.780]   and then my rating has taken a nosedive,
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.060]   which by the way happens by and large
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.740]   when you get to our age, I think.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.860]   In fact, I was in Philly over the 4th of July
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.860]   playing in the World Open,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.020]   getting beat by eight and nine-year-olds.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.180]   - (laughs) Okay.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.020]   - Yeah.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.780]   You can't see them behind me,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.700]   but I've got chess books, chess software, databases.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.940]   I'm like the golfer who has all these gadgets
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.260]   to try to improve their swing, but still shoots a 115.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.460]   And that's me in chess pretty much.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.500]   - Yeah, I'm curious about what you just said though,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.340]   this cognitive decline after a certain age.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.580]   Is there some chess data statistically
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.580]   where the average chess player as they age,
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.020]   this number declines, is that out there somewhere?
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.700]   - I couldn't point you to a study,
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.520]   although I suspect they're out there,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.820]   but I can tell you certainly at the World Championship level
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.340]   it's a young person's game.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.840]   At some point, Garry Kasparov got to an age
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.460]   where he couldn't keep up.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.500]   I mean, obviously even today, he's like Michael Jordan.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.340]   I'm gonna guess he's still
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.740]   a pretty good basketball player, right?
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.180]   But probably not gonna play in the NBA again.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.340]   Garry, obviously a phenomenal chess player,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.900]   but as you age, it's hard to keep up
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.460]   with the younger players.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.660]   Magnus Carlsen is the world champion now,
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.860]   still the best in the world,
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.940]   but there are several players
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.180]   that are probably gonna catch him, when, who knows.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.380]   In my case, obviously I don't play
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.600]   at anything like that, of course.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.580]   I don't know that it's a cognitive decline,
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.180]   at least maybe I just try to convince myself.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.580]   - Okay, well, that's my point.
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.500]   See, this is exactly what I'm getting at,
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.100]   because of just what you said, okay?
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.700]   It in fact is the cognitive decline,
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.680]   but we don't want to admit it.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.780]   And I see it in myself.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.580]   I've been trying to write a book for three years,
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.660]   same book, right?
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.540]   Now, I've written a lot of books, right?
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.220]   You know, I used to be able to bang out a book,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.460]   it seems like, every six months, boom, boom, boom.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.900]   But here I am in my 60s, and I'm trying to write this book,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.960]   and it's not a very complicated book.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.920]   But I'm really struggling, and I can't tell
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.060]   whether or not I'm just trying to do
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.260]   a really, really good job, or if I'm having
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.780]   some sort of a cognitive decline issue.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.580]   Of course, I'd like to think that it's because
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.000]   I'm really trying to do a great job,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.080]   and really trying to be very clear in everything I say,
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.740]   and maybe that is the case, you know?
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.060]   And I think this is an issue with people who are,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.080]   let's say, in their 60s, which I am in my 60s now,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.020]   my mid-60s, and we don't recognize
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.860]   cognitive decline for what it is.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.280]   And it's just interesting that, you know,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.620]   you were talking about chess and talking about this,
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.460]   because when it comes to your investment portfolio
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.660]   when investing, there's a lot of things
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.100]   that can help you with cognitive decline.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.860]   And one of them is keeping a portfolio very simple.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.420]   And this gets me to circle back
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.500]   to your Harold Advansky discussion.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.300]   Because I'm sitting there watching that video,
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.580]   and you said to yourself, gee, you know,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.340]   the bucket strategy, I used to have a three-bucket strategy,
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.140]   but realized that that was actually overly complicated,
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.380]   and now I'm going to more along the Harold Advansky view
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.960]   of just a two-bucket strategy.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.260]   So you, you know, recall that conversation
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.580]   you had with Harold?
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.580]   - Oh, sure, absolutely.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.060]   - You know, what I see there is simplicity.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.260]   In other words, for older investors,
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.220]   the simpler you can make things,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.540]   the simpler you can make portfolios, the better it is.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.140]   - When I first retired, right before I went to Forbes,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.820]   and I thought I'm going to be living off my investments,
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.660]   the three-bucket strategy really appealed to me.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.580]   Maybe it's a little more complicated than two,
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.620]   but it's like, you know, how much more complicated
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.640]   can one extra bucket be, right?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.440]   But when you actually start to sit down and figure out,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.100]   okay, well, wait a minute, when am I going to move stocks
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.240]   from my, from bucket three to fixed income and bucket two?
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.380]   I think the three-bucket approach just doesn't,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.460]   at least it doesn't work for me,
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.140]   because I want to allocate my investments
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.400]   based on percentages, not based on years of expenses,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.060]   which is effectively what the bucket strategy does.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.480]   In a two-bucket strategy scenario,
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.220]   like Harold described in the interview,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.340]   yeah, the cash bucket is based on years of expenses,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.020]   but it's a very small component.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.700]   It may be just one year of cash, for example.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.500]   And the rest is just, you know, your basic whatever,
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.500]   70/30, 60/40, whatever works for you.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.460]   So yeah, it is simpler, the two-bucket strategy,
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.380]   but I'm still not convinced that, frankly,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.780]   a three-bucket strategy works for most people,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.420]   because it changes the way you do your asset allocation,
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.040]   and I think that can lead to some problems,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.980]   particularly depending on your withdrawal strategy.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.700]   - Yeah, initially, the bucket approach
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.580]   was what was called the Tobin Separation Rule, right?
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.440]   Tobin was a Nobel Laureate,
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.200]   and he basically said you have your risky assets,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.440]   you have your non-risky assets.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.460]   I mean, the two buckets.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.500]   I mean, they didn't call it the bucket strategy back then,
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.740]   but that's what it was.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.300]   And so your risky assets generally were equity,
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.700]   but, you know, can be a balanced portfolio
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.660]   of stocks and bonds.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.080]   And the difference between the three-bucket approach
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.300]   and the two-bucket approach, I think,
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.800]   is that allocation to stocks and bonds
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.420]   and the two-bucket approach is constant.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.340]   It doesn't change.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.500]   And the only thing that changes is moving money
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.480]   from that riskier, longer-term bucket
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.900]   over to the cash bucket that you would need to live off of.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.700]   But it was funny that you said something.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.500]   You said, "Gee, you know, I really am in line
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.420]   "with a lot of the things that you were telling me."
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.340]   This is what you said to Harold.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.680]   He said, "I don't want people to think
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.540]   "that I'm stealing your ideas."
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.500]   But here was my comment about that,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.780]   because again, you and I have been
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.880]   in this business a long time.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.700]   Harold's been in the business a long time.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.340]   Of course, Jack Bogle was in the business
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.940]   for how many years?
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.860]   A long, long, long, longer than us,
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.080]   probably twice as long as us.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   But as you get older or as you get more experienced,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.460]   you become simpler in the way you think about things.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.060]   And being simpler becomes much more helpful.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.380]   So, it wasn't like you were copying Harold
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.000]   or that I was copying Harold
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.540]   or that any of us were copying Jack Bogle.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.740]   I think that what happens is that
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.640]   as we get older and more experienced,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.140]   and with or without cognitive decline, it doesn't matter,
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.560]   we just gravitate towards things that are simpler.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.780]   - Well, it absolutely describes my investing story.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.780]   When I first started truly understanding index funds
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.180]   and asset allocation, of course,
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.620]   your book, "All About Asset Allocation,"
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.380]   I think is one of the best out there.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.900]   - I didn't pay you for that, by the way.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.740]   I just want- - No, no.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.940]   That was unsolicited.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.940]   - But thank you for that, Shill.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.780]   I appreciate it.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.820]   - Yeah, unsolicited endorsement.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.340]   Back in the day, I can remember just being so upset
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.940]   that Vanguard didn't offer
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   all of the really cool index funds that DFA offered.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.460]   And that to get dimensional funds,
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.220]   and by the way, one of the founders,
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.260]   Sinkfield, is a big supporter of chess.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.500]   I don't know if you know that connection.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.020]   In any event- - Oh, no, I did not.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.540]   - Oh, yeah, he's funded the chess club in St. Louis
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.380]   in the Hall of Fame,
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.980]   and he has a Sinkfield Cup every year, big time.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.380]   But I remember being so upset
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.780]   because I wasn't gonna pay an advisor
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.060]   to get access to these funds.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.140]   Now, they have some ETFs today.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.180]   And I'm trying to figure out how can I get
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.860]   these cool funds with different factors,
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.100]   international, small cap value, and all these things.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.740]   And today, fast forward 25 years or whatever,
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.060]   it's the last thing I would do.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.100]   And it's not because there's necessarily
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.700]   anything wrong with doing that.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.460]   It's just that I don't need the aggravation.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.380]   And there's no way to know
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.820]   if it's gonna improve your returns or your volatility.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.380]   I mean, you can maybe make some educated guesses.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.220]   We all can.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.540]   But yeah, so I've absolutely moved
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.860]   from more complexity to less.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.540]   And that's true even recently.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.140]   I've been thinking, well, do I really need
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.180]   an emerging market fund?
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.380]   Do I really need a REIT fund?
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.380]   I mean, again, good arguments to keep them, to have them.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.500]   Certainly wouldn't talk anyone out
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.980]   of having a separate REIT fund.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.500]   But boy, it simplifies the portfolio
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.660]   when you don't have all of those things.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.020]   And the other thing, Rick, that could be part of it,
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.860]   there's aging, right?
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.540]   And maybe you kind of wonder how that influences this.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.300]   But the other thing is when you're starting out,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.040]   maybe you've got a 401(k), maybe you've got an IRA.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.900]   Well, today it feels like my wife and I
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.900]   have 47 different accounts, right?
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.100]   It's not that many, but we've each got a rollover.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.300]   We've each got a Roth.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.400]   I've got an inherited.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.740]   We've got two HSAs.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.140]   We've got two taxable accounts.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.820]   That's a whole nother story.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.460]   It's almost like playing three-dimensional chess.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.860]   So when you're trying to balance all of that,
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.340]   having a simpler portfolio, I think, helps a lot.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.660]   I really like that analogy with three-dimensional chess.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.940]   Not only do you have a lot of individual investments
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.420]   in each of these individual accounts,
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.340]   because each of the accounts have to have investments,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.760]   you've got all these different accounts.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.260]   Because of taxes, you can't combine your Roth
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.980]   with your wife's Roth, and you can't combine
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.460]   an inherited IRA with a traditional IRA.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.260]   So you've got all these different accounts.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.460]   But usually, if you have HSAs and 401(k)s,
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.360]   they even have different custodians.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.820]   So you're talking about three different levels, right?
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.660]   You have custodians, you have accounts,
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.100]   you have individual investments.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.300]   I mean, it really is complex.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.180]   It's complex enough where, gee, I want to make it
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.540]   as simple as I can wherever I can.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.940]   Combine custodians and get rid of some that I don't need.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.260]   Combine accounts, if I can roll a traditional IRA
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.700]   into a 401(k) that I might still be using,
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.380]   then that's what I can do.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.980]   And within the investment side,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.740]   try to have fewer and fewer investments.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.900]   To me, I mean, I think that three-dimensional chess
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.740]   is a really good analogy for,
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.480]   let's make it as one-dimensional as we can.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.540]   But it's impossible, I mean, you can't.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.460]   And I think that some of the tax regulation
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.500]   causes you to not be able to do that.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.020]   And we'll get to more of this in a minute
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.740]   in how to organize portfolios
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.420]   when we start talking about all the tools
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.860]   and all of the work you've done
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.300]   to look at all these different tools
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.180]   and calculators that are on the internet,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.980]   some for free, some with a little bit of cost,
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.620]   and where you can find all this information
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.340]   on your website and other places.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.900]   But before we do that, you wrote a book.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.720]   And the book was called "Retire Before Mom and Dad,
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.000]   "The Simple Numbers Between a Lifetime
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.760]   "and Financial Freedom."
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.120]   Thank you for sending me a copy.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.920]   I read it, I thought it was very good.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.760]   Tell me about the book,
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.100]   what motivated you to write it, and what is it about?
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.320]   - So it started out, actually,
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.800]   my original plan was to focus entirely on compounding.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.120]   I was gonna call it money math,
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.440]   and someone pointed out that most people don't like math.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.040]   (both laughing)
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.400]   That's true.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.640]   And then I thought, you know,
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.520]   I really want young people to read it
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.920]   before they wake up and find themselves
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.720]   in their 40s and 50s and having not set aside money.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.640]   And so I called it "Retire Before Mom and Dad."
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.340]   And it kind of does take, I suppose,
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.720]   a young person's perspective,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.960]   although it's not really about early retirement,
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.000]   although it certainly walks through the math.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.880]   It's really about all the things you and I talk about,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.520]   spending less than you make,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.800]   investing the difference in a very simplified,
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.480]   low-cost, index fund portfolio,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.080]   and then getting out of the way (laughs)
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.160]   and letting it do its thing.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.480]   And, you know, I go through some practical examples.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.360]   I challenge, you know, I talk about, you know,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.240]   thinking about your spending, what brings you happiness,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.480]   how to test through life experiments
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.740]   what you think brings you happiness,
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.920]   which I've had on different occasions an opportunity to do.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.760]   And so that's basically the book in a nutshell.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.480]   - And I thought the title, by the way,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.640]   is what caught my eye.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.920]   So you were right in changing the title
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.240]   Retire Before Mom and Dad.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.260]   When I saw that, I said, that's a good title.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.100]   It's catchy.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.120]   It's better than investment math, money math.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.960]   (laughs)
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.440]   So anyway, the name of the book is
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.620]   Retire Before Mom and Dad,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.960]   The Simple Numbers Behind a Lifetime of Financial Freedom.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.480]   Okay, let's get into the nuts and bolts
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.900]   of why I really wanted you on.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.120]   First of all, thank you, by the way,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.540]   for participating in the Bogleheads Conference,
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.000]   which is coming up this October.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.380]   You're gonna be one of our presenters.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.800]   You're going to be on a panel.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.040]   And I appreciate you coming to the conference
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.240]   and telling everyone about all the great things
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.080]   that you've done and a lot of your knowledge
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.880]   and helping to spread your knowledge among the Bogleheads.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   The big draw is all of the financial tool reviews
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.720]   that you have on robberger.com.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.640]   I mean, literally, it is a treasure chest of information,
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.640]   reviews on all of these different software programs,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.980]   robo-advisors, on and on and on,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.260]   all the different categories.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.340]   I mean, you have spent an inordinate amount of time
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.900]   looking at all this.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.900]   And also, I know that you've looked at the Bogleheads wiki
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.600]   and the tools and calculators on the Bogleheads wiki.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.640]   So first of all, could you tell me about your obsession
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.460]   with tools and calculators?
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.980]   And then we'll talk about some.
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.820]   - Let me first say in terms of the Boglehead site
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.220]   and the wiki, I don't think there's anything better.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.900]   I mean, in terms of just the information, it's phenomenal.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   The amount of work they've put into that
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.380]   is just extraordinary.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.740]   And I find myself going back to it time and again.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.300]   I was, in fact, just looking at it the other day
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.460]   in terms of withdrawal strategies.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.620]   So in terms of tools, I'm kind of a tool junkie.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.900]   I just find the technology fascinating.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.660]   Before I was a lawyer in the securities field,
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.500]   I litigated technology-related cases
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.580]   for about 10 or 15 years.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.700]   And I just, I find it fascinating.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.660]   And there's plenty more that I want to put on my site.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.720]   I mean, in many ways, I've got far more work ahead of me.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.380]   And I kind of want to go beyond tools, too.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.660]   I want to have a lot of detail on withdrawal strategies,
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.980]   frankly, a lot of detail on the different lazy portfolios.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.520]   Because as much as I'd like to tell folks,
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.420]   well, just do the three fund and you're done,
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.400]   I know that some people just want some spice, I guess,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.500]   in their portfolio.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.260]   - Yeah, icing on the cake.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.620]   In terms of the tools, in fact,
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.480]   I was just reworking a page on my site
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.500]   where I basically listed the tools that I tend to use
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.460]   on a regular basis.
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.460]   Happy to talk about them.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.020]   I kind of, you mentioned robo-advisors.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.420]   I certainly have some strong opinions
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.380]   about which ones I like.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.220]   But I also cover things like retirement planning tools,
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.980]   calculators, just sort of investing tools.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.220]   Like how do you know what your asset allocation is?
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.100]   How do you know not just what your investment fees are,
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.540]   but what effect they'll have on your portfolio over time?
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.740]   - Well, let's start with the first group.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.180]   Let's start with the retirement planning calculators
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.660]   because then that folds into asset allocation.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.460]   And then we could talk about robo-advisors.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.180]   So let's start with retirement planning tools.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.220]   What's available out there?
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.620]   What's free?
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.740]   What's a low cost?
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.680]   Start with those.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.760]   - Okay, so in terms of retirement planning that's free,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.400]   one would be personal capital,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.500]   which we'll probably talk about
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.980]   in a couple of different contexts.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.100]   So, and people have to understand what personal capital is.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.080]   So personal capital is a registered investment advisor.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.820]   So their business is getting,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.280]   managing your assets for a percent of AUM.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.020]   As a, frankly, as a marketing tool,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:00.020]   they've built a pretty nice financial tool that's free.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.380]   - Ah, do you have to be,
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.500]   you don't have to be a client to use it?
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.100]   - No, I've used it since they launched it
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.620]   and I'm not a client.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.060]   Basically, you connect all of your accounts or you can,
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.720]   you know, not just investment accounts,
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.700]   but you can connect bank accounts, all your debt.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.640]   If you have debt,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.340]   you can actually connect the value of your home.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.820]   They look up the price via Zillow for you.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.100]   And it kind of does a little of everything.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.520]   It shows you your net worth.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.780]   You can use it as a budget, you know, spending tracker.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.860]   It'll automatically categorize most of your spending.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.540]   Some of it, it doesn't know the category for,
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.140]   but it does a pretty good job.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.940]   They have, I think, a pretty decent retirement planner.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.420]   You know, based on the accounts you've connected,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.460]   you can make certain assumptions.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.820]   Of course, when you're going to retire,
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.040]   assumptions about how long you're going to live,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.220]   inflation assumptions.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.320]   And if you're married, you can factor that in.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.480]   You can factor in expenses and income in retirement.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.360]   So maybe you're going to take a trip around the world.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.140]   You can put that in with a date.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.660]   In terms of a free retirement planning tool,
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.740]   particularly if you're still in the accumulation phase,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.780]   you haven't actually retired,
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.860]   and you're just wanting to get sort of a bird's eye view
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.780]   of how you're doing, I think it's a pretty good tool.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.620]   - Okay.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.220]   - But there's another one I like a lot that's free,
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.820]   but it's got a very specific purpose.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.300]   It's called FICALC, so F-I-C-A-L-C dot app.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.460]   That's the website.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.380]   - Okay.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.420]   - And what it allows you to do is put in, you know,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.980]   how long your retirement's going to be,
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.880]   how much you have, how much you're going to spend,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.240]   what your asset allocation is.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.600]   It's very simple, basically stocks, bonds, and cash.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.880]   And then you can select from, oh, I don't know,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.520]   maybe about a dozen withdrawal strategies.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.280]   And then using historical data going back to 1926,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.040]   which is effectively what Bill Bingen did in his '94 paper
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.940]   that gave us the 4% rule,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.800]   it will crunch the numbers
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.080]   and tell you your chances of success.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.060]   Success being not running out of money, right?
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.900]   But the thing that I really like about this tool
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.340]   is that it will show you for all of the year.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.860]   So, you know, starting in 1926,
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.340]   would you run out of money or not?
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.100]   But it'll also show you those 30 year scenarios,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.940]   if that's how long you've put in for your planned retirement
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.080]   where you didn't run out of money,
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.380]   but you almost ran out of money.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.360]   Because I think that's as important
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.960]   as just quote unquote success.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.320]   I'm not sure I'd call success, you know,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.200]   on year 30, dying with $0,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.580]   because that would have been a hard last year.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.960]   And so it will show you those periods where,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.040]   yeah, you didn't run out of money,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.360]   but boy, you were close.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.420]   And you can actually click on each year
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.200]   and it'll give you details
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.420]   about how that retirement would have looked
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.560]   had you, for example, with the assumptions you put in
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.980]   and the withdrawal strategy you've chosen,
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.200]   you know, and retired in whatever,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.320]   1968 or whatever year you want,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.600]   how that would have worked out.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.400]   And by the way, in the different withdrawal strategies,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.560]   they include the Vanguard dynamic spending strategy.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.720]   - Well, before we go on,
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.800]   could you explain what dynamic spending is?
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.920]   - Yeah, so if you think about the 4% rule,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.680]   the way Bill Bingen tested it was
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.700]   you start with a certain percentage of your portfolio
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.660]   in year one, let's just assume 4%.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.460]   And then every year thereafter, the 4% is irrelevant.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.180]   You just adjust the previous year's distribution
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.740]   by the rate of inflation.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.300]   So that would be considered a static spending rule,
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.500]   static on an after inflation basis,
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.300]   because you're effectively spending the same amount of money
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.800]   on an after inflation basis throughout retirement.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.980]   Basically just about every other spending strategy
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.660]   is dynamic, right?
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.220]   Again, dynamic meaning the amounts changing
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.780]   on an after inflation basis.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.340]   And on one extreme would be a fixed percentage.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.840]   So you're just gonna take out 5% every year.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.420]   And that's dynamic because, well, think of it this year,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.940]   you know, the market's down 20%.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.540]   Let's say it ends the year that way.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.180]   If you take your 5% this year,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.820]   it's gonna be a lot lower than the 5% you took last year.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.900]   So that would be sort of an extreme case.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.760]   And frankly, the static approach that Bill Bingen took,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.300]   I personally view as an extreme approach
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.840]   to retirement spending as well.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.420]   They're just sort of on opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.900]   - The 4% rule or any percentage,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.580]   I've always had an issue with that
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.420]   because my expenses are going up with inflation
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.420]   and if my 4% is less than my expenses,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.280]   that doesn't work.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.460]   I still have to take the money out and pay my expenses.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.460]   - Again, the 4% only applies to the first year, right?
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.000]   - Okay, that's what I wanted to get across.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.460]   - Yeah, and then you adjust for inflation.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.020]   By the way, he believes
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.800]   with a somewhat more complicated portfolio, by the way,
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   small cap, mid cap, even micro cap, it's 4.7%.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.700]   - Yeah, well, good luck with that.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.940]   - Well, look, I'm just reporting what I've heard.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.780]   - Fair enough.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.100]   Okay, so we've got two now, two different programs.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.580]   And is there a third one
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.340]   that you might like for retirement planning?
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.340]   - The most robust tool for consumers would be new retirement.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.460]   - Okay.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.280]   - From a planner perspective,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.020]   they're gonna use MoneyGuide Pro or eMoney Advisor
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.360]   and I've worked with both of those tools.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.420]   But those are generally not available to consumers
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.540]   unless they have a planner
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.940]   that they're working with.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.580]   New retirement is, I think,
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.060]   comparable to both of those tools.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.940]   And it's a very robust tool.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.780]   It's not the kind of thing
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.780]   where you can just spend five minutes with it
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.300]   and have results.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.280]   Because it walks through pretty much everything
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.500]   that would be relevant to spending during retirement.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   So it's gonna walk through long-term care insurance.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.180]   It's gonna walk through social security questions.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.880]   It's gonna walk through Medicare
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.940]   and estimate your Medicare premiums and medical costs.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.000]   You're going to enter your accounts,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.900]   your investment accounts,
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.340]   and you can link them
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.000]   and have that data pulled in automatically
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.520]   or you can manually put them in
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.120]   if you're more comfortable with that, which is what I do.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.660]   But you're gonna set both pessimistic
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.420]   and optimistic return assumptions for every single account.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.280]   Which is useful if, like me,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.800]   you really take advantage of asset location, right?
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.360]   So 'cause my traditional retirement accounts,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.760]   I don't expect the returns to be as high
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.520]   as my Roth and taxable accounts
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.080]   because of what I have invested in them.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.640]   And so you can make those assumptions separate
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.400]   on an account level.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.560]   You can walk through,
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.760]   if you expect to get an inheritance at some point,
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.340]   you can model that.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.680]   Maybe you have passive income
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.840]   or some other sort of side income in retirement.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.100]   So you can model all of these things.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.680]   You can even model Roth conversions.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.780]   And once you get done inputting all of this information,
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.300]   it gives you really a lot of both charts and tables
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.500]   showing you, here's your chances of success.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.560]   Again, success defined as not running out of money.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.640]   And they use Monte Carlo analysis.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.320]   But it gives you a wealth of information.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.080]   It'll show you your tax brackets
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.720]   all the way through life expectancy,
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.700]   including when your RMDs kick in.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.860]   It'll show you your state income tax.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.060]   You can model, maybe you move.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.180]   Maybe you live in California when you're working
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.960]   and you're gonna move to Texas or Tennessee for the taxes.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   When you retire, you can model that,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.240]   including you can set separate inflation rates
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.200]   for real estate and model that home
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.360]   you're gonna buy 15 years from now.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.340]   And it'll change the tax implications
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.240]   depending on where you're gonna move from and to.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   So it really is, I mean, a feature rich tool.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.200]   It is not free though.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   But I think the cost in my view is really reasonable.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.760]   So they have three different tiers.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.200]   The lowest, which gives you access to the tool is $120
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.040]   a year.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   - A year, $10 a month.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   - You can go up from there.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.440]   They actually have started offering planning
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.360]   with a certified financial planner, if you want.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.040]   - Is that extra obviously, or is that?
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.440]   - Yeah, so that starts at 1500 a year.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.840]   But you can also do what they call Planner Plus Live.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.520]   I feel like I'm a salesperson.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.760]   You can also do Planner Plus Live, which is 360
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.440]   and you get one-on-one coaching.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.240]   For me, I just use the tool.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.720]   But for others, the coaching for a year might help.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.720]   But for me, it's probably the most comprehensive
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.400]   retirement planning.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.360]   It's really designed for when you're getting,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.280]   I think, closer to retirement.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.080]   It's not the only one out there.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.640]   There are some other interesting ones.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.880]   But new retirement's probably my favorite.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.680]   - The technology for do-it-yourself investors
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.360]   on the retirement planning side has really come a long way.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.720]   Like you were saying, most of the technology
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.760]   used to be MoneyGuide Pro or eMoney.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.520]   And that's for people in the industry.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.320]   But with these new companies coming along,
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.400]   the ability to do-it-yourself for do-it-yourself investors
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.160]   for a very nominal fee is really exciting, I think.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.640]   - And I will say, it's a hard market.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.240]   I mean, I think selling to advisors, planners,
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.560]   is a much easier, I mean, it's competitive, of course,
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.480]   but, you know, I mean, how many people
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.240]   really wanna dive into a tool like this?
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.080]   I mean, those that do are probably
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   all listening to your podcast, Rick.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.920]   - I'm not sure, but--
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.760]   - You know, you randomly ask a person on the street
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.840]   who's, say, within five years of retirement,
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.040]   hey, you wanna go to a coffee shop and spend three hours
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.520]   looking at retirement projections?
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.600]   Probably not gonna get a lot of yeses.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.040]   - But you know what, maybe employers,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   maybe employers at some point would incorporate this
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.280]   in their HR departments.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.480]   - That's already happening.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.880]   I can tell you that's already happening.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.120]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.640]   Let's get into something that is an important part
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   of retirement planning and financial planning,
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.160]   and that's in investment software,
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.560]   asset allocation software,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.160]   portfolio management software.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.520]   So this is kind of a part of it.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.160]   You know, you've gotta get a certain rate of return
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.760]   or you're looking for a certain rate of return on your money.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.080]   So let's talk about the tools that are available out there
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.680]   for doing investing.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.120]   The free ones, the free ones,
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.120]   and then, you know, things that might cost a little bit.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.720]   - I think most of these are free that come to mind.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.520]   Well, I'll go back to Personal Capital
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.440]   because they have a very slick asset allocation feature
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.120]   that's got graphical elements to it
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.240]   where it shows you, particularly on the U.S. side,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.880]   I'm not sure the international side is as robust
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.200]   as I recall, but, you know,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.440]   it shows you your, basically,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.200]   your different asset classes in boxes
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.120]   and then in table form,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.360]   and you can click on a box and it drills in,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.320]   and it'll show you, you know, for your large cap value,
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.360]   here are the funds and what percentage each fund,
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.160]   you know, contributes to that asset class,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.840]   and you can draw all the way down.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.880]   It'll show you sectors.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.240]   And the other thing I like about it
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.440]   is they have a fee analyzer where, you know,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.800]   of course, it pulls in the,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.760]   it knows the fees of your funds,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.960]   and that's pulled in automatically.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.360]   If you have an advisor that's charging a AUM fee,
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.040]   you can model, you can include that.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.440]   You can also make assumptions of if you're still working,
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.840]   what your contributions are,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.000]   and what, if there's an employer match,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.840]   you can actually model that.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.080]   And the thing I like about it then is it shows you
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.680]   how these fees will affect, you know, your wealth
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:41.680]   up until you retire, and you put that date in the tool.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.160]   That to me is probably, when I'm talking to folks
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.600]   that don't appreciate the impact of fees, you know,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.800]   it's hard to say, well, 1%, what's that?
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.440]   You know, but when you show them,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.760]   well, this is the impact over the next 25 years,
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.200]   boy, they wake up, that gets their attention.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.560]   So that's, I really like that tool.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.080]   So that would be one.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.520]   - Anything else?
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.840]   - Morningstar is kind of interesting right now.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.800]   So I think in terms of just quickly understanding a fund,
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.960]   to me, Morningstar is probably the best thing out there.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.040]   It's really good.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.200]   - Is there a cost to the level that you're talking at?
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.040]   - Right now, no.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.800]   So if you just want to evaluate a fund,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.600]   you can put the ticker in Morningstar.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.680]   It'll give you, you know, it'll give you the style box,
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.120]   right, so it'll show you, is it small cap, large cap,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.480]   value, growth, all of the, you know,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.920]   give you all the valuation metrics,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.000]   PE, price to book, price to sale.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.600]   Of course, it'll give you its expense ratio.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.160]   It'll show you, I think they show for free
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.800]   the top 30 holdings, right?
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.880]   They have always had a portfolio tracker.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.640]   At one point it was free.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.320]   You had access to like the X-ray analysis
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.080]   and other things with the paid version.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.160]   They're moving over to a new system.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.040]   It's actually investor.morningstar.com.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.600]   And they sort of upped their game
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.840]   in terms of the user interface.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.600]   'Cause the old version was like, you know,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.760]   1990s called and it wanted its website back, right?
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.320]   I mean, it was really outdated.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.080]   The new one is much better,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.480]   but I still think it's a work in progress.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.080]   They're still trying to work out the kinks
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.360]   and figure it all out.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.680]   You know, you get a wealth of data,
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.160]   but at some point it looks like a lot of the features
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.680]   now are behind, you know, you have to pay.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.400]   Yeah, but it's still, I mean, an overall good tool.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.720]   Another one I like is Portfolio Visualizer.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.400]   I don't know if you're familiar with that tool,
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.320]   but you can put in, it's not really
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.080]   to sort of track your investments,
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.640]   but you can put in a portfolio
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   either based on asset classes or specific tickers.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.320]   And it will show you the historical returns
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.720]   of that portfolio.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.560]   You can compare multiple portfolios.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.200]   It'll show you, you know, rolling averages,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.520]   say five, 10-year rolling average returns.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.120]   It'll show you standard deviation.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.360]   Of course, the compound annual growth rate.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.440]   And they have some pre-programmed portfolios.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.080]   Like they have the Bogleheads 3 Fund Portfolio
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.560]   where you just click a button and it fills in
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.800]   Vanguard funds and percentages.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.760]   And they also have one guy named Rick Ferry.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.200]   I don't know if you've seen it, but your four fund,
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.400]   your core portfolio is in there.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.440]   Well, I actually use it on that Core 4 website.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.680]   Another part of the tool is
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.520]   they have a Monte Carlo simulator.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.200]   You could kind of, it's kind of not like FI Calc,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.640]   but you can put a specific portfolio in there
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.520]   and model the drawdown.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.720]   So you could put in like a million dollar portfolio
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.760]   or whatever.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   Assume, let's say a $45,000 initial withdrawal.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.920]   Adjust it for inflation every year.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.320]   And, but put your specific portfolio in there
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.160]   and it will model how that has done.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.600]   And you can actually change a number
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.640]   of the different statistical assumptions.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.520]   But for example, it can use historical data.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.760]   And so I find that tool to be extremely helpful.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.600]   - Okay.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.760]   Anything else out there for portfolio management
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.000]   and asset allocation?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.280]   - I will mention one other tool in large part
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.640]   because I'm so frustrated
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   that like all of the other brokers don't offer this.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.920]   I've used M1 Finance a bit.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.520]   I don't have an account there now,
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   but you can create a portfolio, very simple,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.320]   low cost index fund portfolio
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.280]   and invest your money through M1 Finance.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.520]   And then when it comes time to rebalance,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.080]   first of all, when you can make new contributions,
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.880]   they will automatically put it into the various funds
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.920]   to try to bring you back
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.400]   to whatever your planned allocation is.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.240]   And you can also just click a button
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.880]   and they will automatically rebalance for you.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.280]   Now I probably wouldn't do that in a taxable account
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.920]   or not without understanding the consequences,
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.280]   but within a retirement account, boy,
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.640]   that's pretty nifty.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   And I'm kind of waiting for, I don't know,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.680]   Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.640]   It doesn't seem like it would be that complicated
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.200]   and investment advisors have rebalancing tools.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.560]   But as far as I know,
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.440]   M1 Finance is the only one
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.000]   that's actually made it available,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.520]   well, other than robo-advisors that do it for you.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.640]   - Let's talk about robo-advisors for a bit.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.280]   And then the last thing I wanna talk about
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.200]   are all the tools on the Bogleheads Wiki,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.160]   calculators and tools.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.760]   So let's talk about all the work that you've done
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.360]   on evaluating robo-advisors.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.680]   If someone decided they wanted to have another company
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.320]   manage their portfolio and do the rebalancing,
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   could you go through your list of top three robos?
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.440]   - Yeah, and just for sort of perspective,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.200]   I've used Wealthfront, I've used Betterment,
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.440]   and I've used Vanguard's digital advisory services.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.000]   And then I've spent a lot of time studying Schwab's
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.080]   and SoFi's and others.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.640]   My personal favorite today is Betterment and I use it.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   We invest our credit card reward.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.800]   So we get cash back or whatever, I don't spend it.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.640]   We invest it.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.360]   Part of that is to show people how small amounts of money,
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.320]   invested over time, can grow significantly.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.640]   And it also allows me, I move it from time to time
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.120]   just to test out different platforms.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.960]   It wasn't in one finance at the moment, it's at Betterment.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   And I just really like Betterment.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.080]   I mean, it's got great tax loss harvesting tools,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.360]   which I don't view tax loss harvesting
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   as some massive addition to a portfolio.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.480]   I think in some cases it could be, but it's there.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.520]   They have an asset location tool
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.960]   if you have your retirement accounts there.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.920]   I think they've got some great core portfolios.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.360]   They have some other things I don't care for,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.040]   but their core portfolio I think is good.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.240]   And you can actually create your own.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.480]   You're limited in the ETFs you can use,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.280]   but for a bogal head, they've got everything we could want.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.240]   - Speak a little bit more about the asset location too.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.560]   That interests me, how they do that.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.760]   - They have an automated feature
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   that when they're setting up your accounts,
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.240]   they'll do an asset location analysis
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.600]   and divide your investments based on an account type.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.480]   I've read about it.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.760]   Like I said, I haven't used it,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.400]   so I can't speak from experience,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.000]   but it seems like the kind of thing
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.160]   that technology should be able to do for us pretty easily.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.760]   And I still kind of marvel
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.320]   that it's not more widely available,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.160]   but maybe it's available with other advisors.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.680]   Betterment's the only one at least that I know of.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.720]   - Wealthfront was recently sold, correct?
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.360]   And you had money with them.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.800]   I mean, how do you feel about Wealthfront
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.840]   and the fact that now they're owned by UBS?
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   - Yeah, I liked Wealthfront.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.280]   I mean, I think it's a solid robo-advisor.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.080]   It would probably be my top three
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.640]   if I were gonna come up with three.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.680]   One could wonder what the sale,
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.880]   how that will affect it going forward.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.480]   And I guess there's no way to really know.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.840]   Maybe it'll have no effect.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.840]   Maybe they'll invest more money in it, I don't know.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.880]   All of these robo-advisors,
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.360]   they're trying to survive, right?
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.800]   And so I do see them going in directions
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   that I personally, maybe getting into crypto
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.640]   or getting into the smart beta kind of thing as examples
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.840]   or really pushing direct indexing as Fidelity and Schwab
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.720]   are both doing that now.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   And I'm just not convinced that these are things
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.040]   that for most people are worthwhile.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.560]   And in direct indexing,
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.840]   which you typically wanna do in a taxable account,
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.600]   I've talked to folks who decide later
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.340]   they wanna leave whatever.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.960]   Wealthfront's had direct indexing for a while.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.680]   They wanna leave it and manage their own investments
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.640]   and they got 120 positions.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.080]   At least, at least.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.400]   Yeah, so you gotta be careful.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.520]   I know in theory, direct indexing, I think,
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.560]   has a lot of appeal in theory, but in the event,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.320]   so you've gotta be careful as you evaluate what they offer.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.680]   But overall, I like Wealthfront.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.840]   I was not as impressed
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.320]   with Vanguard's digital advisory services.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.480]   Now, this is the personal advisory service,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.440]   but only basically the electronic
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.800]   portfolio management side?
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.680]   No advice, no speaking with somebody?
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.760]   Correct.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.520]   Yeah, there were a lot of technical issues.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.080]   I mean, to their credit, they were eventually resolved.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.240]   But it took me two weeks just to get the account going
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.280]   because of technical issues.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.360]   And then pieces of it didn't work.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.000]   But again, to their credit, they got it fixed.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.400]   It's not nearly as feature rich.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.120]   I mean, in some ways, it's almost like a life strategy
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.000]   or a target date fund wrapped in a cool user interface.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.640]   More tax efficient though, correct?
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.760]   More tax efficient than a balanced fund
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.920]   like a life strategy?
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.600]   That's an interesting question.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.000]   I mean, as you know, Vanguard had some issues
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.640]   with the taxes on their target date funds.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.800]   And I don't know if you saw,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.760]   they reached an agreement with Massachusetts on that.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.360]   But it's a good question, Rick.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.480]   I don't know if it's more tax efficient or not.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.640]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.760]   Any other robos that you might like that you've looked at?
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.440]   SoFi is interesting.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.880]   It's quote unquote free,
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.080]   but they use some proprietary indexes
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.280]   for some of their funds rather than the S&P 500.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.520]   And with Schwab, you've got,
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.400]   you're required to keep so much in cash.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.360]   So it's quote unquote free, but not really.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.760]   And you saw that settlement they had on that.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.560]   Schwab settlement for holding a lot of money in cash.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.960]   So, I think the issue was that they were representing
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.520]   that it was free and that their recommendations
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.720]   were based sort of in the best interest of the users.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.080]   But whatever, I mean, I applaud companies
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.280]   for trying to make these tools available
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.120]   for quote unquote free, but you gotta be transparent.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.600]   And you and I both know that holding six or 10
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.200]   or 15% in cash in a portfolio is not free.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.720]   Well, in addition, they also hold a lot of Schwab funds.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:20.160]   Not that the funds that they hold are really expensive,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.640]   but they do hold, in the Intelligent Portfolio,
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.360]   they do hold a lot of Schwab ETFs.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.520]   Yeah, the thing I look to, and maybe you do too,
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.440]   is one, are they based on a proprietary index or not?
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.200]   'Cause Fidelity Zero funds, for example, are based on,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.040]   and it's not that they're necessarily bad funds,
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.560]   but they're based on a Fidelity proprietary index, right?
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.840]   Yeah, correct.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.560]   I just feel more comfortable with the old S&P 500
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.800]   or whatever sort of well-recognized index.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.400]   And then, yeah, you gotta look at fees.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.640]   I think, for the most part, these ETFs
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.140]   are pretty inexpensive.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.080]   Okay, let's get into the last thing I wanna talk about,
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.280]   'cause I asked you to take a look at this,
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   is all of the tools that are available
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.840]   on the Bogleheads Wiki,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.120]   Tools and Calculators page.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   Just an incredible number of free tools, so have at it.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.400]   Well, first of all, I would recommend
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.140]   that those folks listening are interested, go to it.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.400]   I don't know if you can leave a link,
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.560]   but it's just Bogleheads Wiki, Tools and Calculators.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.360]   And, I mean, you could spend a lifetime on the page, right?
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.800]   I mean, it's like, I don't even know where to begin.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.840]   It's like drinking from a fire hose.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.160]   You know, a lot of the tools,
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.600]   some of them we've already talked about.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.960]   Like, for example, backtesting,
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.280]   they mentioned Portfolio Visualizer as a good example.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.200]   But they include things like a backtesting spreadsheet
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.480]   that the community put together.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:56.760]   I've not personally used it, but it's on my list to use it.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.640]   And, you know, that kind of thing is very unique
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.580]   to the Bogleheads community,
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.160]   and I would highly recommend it.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.240]   But, you know, they have bond calculators,
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.480]   if that's something that, you know,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.360]   listeners are interested in.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.480]   They link to tools, and Vanguard actually has a good one
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.080]   on, you know, college savings.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.640]   You know, if you're at that stage of life
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.080]   where you're saving for, say, a child's education.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.900]   They have, you know, things like on life expectancy
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.400]   and calculators there.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.760]   I tend to avoid looking at those things.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.540]   I'm not sure I want to know.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.640]   You know, but they have everything.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.480]   They have a ton of loan and mortgage calculators.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.800]   And again, what these are,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.400]   these are not necessarily things built by the Bogleheads.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.200]   Some things like that spreadsheet I mentioned are,
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.920]   but these are just links to other calculators.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.480]   One they have that's one of my favorites
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.520]   that I actually haven't been to in a while,
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   but it's called Carl's Mortgage Calculator.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.980]   It's a simple mortgage calculator,
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.520]   but it's really easy to use.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.360]   And, you know, if you're looking to figure out
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.860]   how much a mortgage is going to cost to buy a home,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.960]   that's excellent.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.020]   So yeah, they actually have dozens and dozens and dozens
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:18.960]   of retirement savings calculators on here,
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   free ones and ones that you can buy.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.160]   They have a kind of a spreadsheet, you know,
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.800]   which ones do which and so forth.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   But again, like you said,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.080]   you could spend a lifetime on here
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.860]   because they have put in so much time, all volunteers.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.860]   I have put in so much time putting this wiki page together
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.880]   and all the different aspects of the free calculators
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   and free tools page that it's just absolutely phenomenal.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.800]   I mean, literally anything that you're looking for this,
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   if you don't know where to go first,
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.200]   to go to Bogleheads wiki tools and calculators
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.380]   is probably a good bet to go there.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.760]   You'll find something.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.000]   Yeah, the thing I would say, I mean,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.560]   if you're a calculator junkie, like maybe you and I are,
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.420]   it's a great place to go.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.100]   If you're not, the thing I would say is,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.700]   as you look through something like this great resource
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.600]   on the Bogleheads site,
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.880]   is just figure out what it is you need.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.880]   We talked about a simple portfolio.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.120]   I would keep the whole tools and calculator aspect
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.600]   as simple as possible too.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   And if free tools work for you, then why pay for it, right?
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.160]   And if you get some benefit out of maybe more advanced tools
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.220]   then that's great too.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.640]   But I mean, 'cause at the end of the day,
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   I probably only use a handful of two or three or four tools
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.740]   on a somewhat regular basis,
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.500]   just because it's all you need really.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.160]   And so what's the next step for you, Rob?
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.480]   I mean, you're continuing to build out your website,
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.160]   you're continuing to do the YouTube videos,
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.320]   going down the credit card alley
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.840]   and working on that as well.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.560]   I mean, where's it all going?
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.600]   What's the next step?
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.880]   I do have a couple of books that I wanna write.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.520]   Oh, okay, great.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.720]   One about how to invest once you're retired.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.200]   Investing in retirement.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.760]   Yeah, because, and this hit me hard, I wasn't expecting it,
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.920]   but when I sold my sites and thought I was retired,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   I was really scared to spend our money,
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.840]   even though by every known calculation,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.640]   we had plenty of money to retire.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.280]   It's nerve wracking to start spending your money.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.040]   And at least I found it to be so.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:36.880]   No, no, it's true.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.960]   I mean, I work with a lot of clients.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.360]   In fact, I had a call today,
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   and this year where this client is transitioning
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:50.120]   from accumulation to distribution in retirement
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:55.240]   is the most nerve wracking time of your life,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.280]   financially anyway,
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.880]   because you just don't know how it's gonna work.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.040]   And you've got a lot of questions
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.920]   and you could have substantial amount of assets
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.360]   and still be, and your spending be very low,
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.600]   and you're still afraid to make that leap.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.480]   Yeah, and unfortunately in the industry,
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.360]   there are a lot of players
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.440]   that will try to profit from that fear.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.520]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.920]   And yeah, you don't encounter that when you're 20 or 30
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.480]   and you're just saving.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.760]   But when you start to retire,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.600]   then folks will try to scare you into certain products.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.680]   So yeah, it's much more challenging than I had anticipated.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.880]   - Any parting words for us, words of wisdom?
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.160]   - Well, I do hope as many people as can
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.400]   come to the Boglehead Conference.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.640]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.280]   And I think where people can find me,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.560]   the YouTube channel is kind of where my heart is
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.720]   in terms of trying to produce content that helps folks.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.760]   It's not fancy.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.240]   I don't have like a production person
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.880]   and I don't even edit the videos.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.680]   So like if I mess up, well, you get to see it all.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.120]   But I do live shows as well.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.320]   People ask me questions and I do my best to answer them.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.840]   I think it's fun.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.160]   I'm not sure if everyone else does, I don't know.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   But people keep showing up, so.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.480]   - Very good.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.640]   Well, Rob, it's been a real pleasure
