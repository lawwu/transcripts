[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.840]   has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee. Police have issued an all-points bulletin for
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.360]   a well-dressed young white man seen running from the scene. Nearly 50 years ago today,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.080]   that's Walter Cronkite on air April 4th, 1968. He was standing on the balcony of a second floor
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.760]   hotel room tonight when, according to a companion, a shot was fired from across the street.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.880]   And before we jump into today's episode, it reminds me that the MLK 50 conference is coming up
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.720]   in a few days in Memphis. And Pastor John, I know you're looking forward to it.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.800]   And on the second evening of the conference, on Wednesday, April 4th, which marks the 50th
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.600]   anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Pastor John, you'll be delivering the
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.120]   final plenary session at 8.30 p.m. local time in a message titled "The Glory of God and Racial
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.440]   Unity." Really looking forward to that. That's Wednesday, April 4th, 8.30 p.m. in Memphis.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.520]   Today's question is related. What does John Calvin have to do with racial reconciliation?
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.040]   In fact, does Reformed theology obstruct racial unity, or does it offer a way forward?
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.720]   The question today comes in from a listener named Drew. "Hello, Pastor John. I live in the South
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.200]   and attend a church that holds to Reformed theology and does great work for the gospel
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.320]   of Christ in our city. My question, do you think it's possible for people in the Reformed world to
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.920]   use theology as an excuse to distance themselves from churches that are predominantly African
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.480]   American in order to avoid any deep issues or discussions of race that come up? How do we fight
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.320]   this and gladly partner with our brothers and sisters in Christ and address the real issues
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.080]   of racial history that exist, especially with churches that are less obviously Reformed in
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.200]   their theology?" The first thing I would say is that the sinful human heart—that is, my heart,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   your heart, all hearts—is capable of taking every theology under the sun and every doctrine in the
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:17.600]   Bible and using it to advance our own personal preferences, even sinful preferences. As far as
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.280]   the content of Reformed theology goes, I think there is as much or more truth for the overcoming
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.480]   of racial and ethnic animosities in this theology as there is in any other theology. I would even
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:42.560]   say there is more. But accurately articulated biblical doctrine by itself is not a sufficient
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:54.400]   dam against the rushing currents of sin that flow in the human heart. We are not saved merely by
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.800]   accurately rehearsing and believing right doctrine. We are saved by a transforming miracle
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:12.240]   of the Holy Spirit called new birth. And that new birth brings into being not merely new ideas about
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:20.400]   God and salvation and humanity and heaven and hell, but gloriously new affections and desires and
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.120]   longings and attitudes and dispositions. And this radical, miraculous, Spirit-wrought
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.160]   transformation, with its utterly essential manifestation in ongoing growth in grace
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:46.240]   and knowledge and love and wisdom, that new birth is all-important in dealing with matters of racial
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.080]   tension. So, no, I don't believe the content of Reformed theology is a stumbling block
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.920]   to the pursuit of racial harmony and racial diversity. In fact, I think the content of
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.840]   Reformed theology is wonderfully, positively explosive in its true implications for overcoming
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:16.640]   racial hostility and suspicion and distrust and dislike. But I'll say again, any theological
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.120]   position, anyone, can be made the servant of sin and is in fact made the servant of sin somewhere
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.560]   in the world. Right doctrine in the life of the church is profoundly important. I've given
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.200]   much of my life to it. But even more important is the radical, supernatural, Spirit-wrought
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.520]   miracle of new birth that creates a new kind of human being. You might even say a new race,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:54.480]   a new race that cuts across every racial and ethnic distinction, a new humanity that is not
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.160]   in its essence and not in its decisive, controlling heart, white or black or Asian or American or
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.040]   British or German or Cherokee or Southern. But let me point out a little catch in something
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   I've said, and you probably picked it up if you're sharp. I said the content of Reformed
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.640]   theology is not a stumbling block to racial harmony. And the reason I stressed the word
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:30.960]   "content" is because the very existence of doctrine, theology, complicates racial harmony
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:40.000]   because it complicates human harmony. Every church that believes that unbiblical doctrine
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.200]   damages people, and that's certainly what I believe, unbiblical doctrine damages people.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.640]   Every church that believes that, every person that believes that will, for the sake of love,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.080]   experience tension with other churches and other people that believe and teach unbiblical doctrine.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.760]   They can't treat it as negligible if it hurts people and dishonors God. And by doctrine,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.840]   I simply mean how you understand the Bible and what it teaches about the nature of God and the
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.280]   nature of Christ and the Holy Spirit and the atonement and the nature of faith and what's
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.720]   the Christian life like and how do you live it, what's heaven and hell like, and how do you avoid
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.960]   going to one and go to the other. If a church down the street treats the Bible as one religious
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.000]   source among many and treats Christ merely as an exemplary teacher and belittles the substitutionary
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.440]   atonement as divine child abuse and marginalizes the miraculous work of the Holy Spirit in
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:56.160]   sanctification, my relational harmony with that church and those folks is going to be much more
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.200]   complicated than if they believe the historic Christian things I believe. And that's true
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:11.360]   whether that church is predominantly white or predominantly black. During most of my ministry,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.640]   it has been much harder to relate to liberal white churches in Minneapolis than it has been
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.200]   to relate to Bible-believing black churches that we had connections with. So what I'm saying
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   is that it's not the content of Reformed theology or the content of Arminian theology per se that
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   creates problems for racial harmony, but the very existence of doctrine. Doctrine itself complicates
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:51.520]   that harmony because it complicates human harmony. If a predominantly black church or a predominantly
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:59.200]   white church or any other kind of ethnic church believes and teaches unbiblical doctrines,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.360]   this is added to any racial or ethnic challenges of harmony. But they're not the same. They're not
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.760]   the same since the doctrinal challenges exist among people of the very same race and the very same
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:26.800]   ethnicity. So let me give four very brief bullet points on what we might do in view of this
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:34.560]   multi-layered challenge of relationships between racially and doctrinally different churches.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:44.400]   Number one, let there be recurrent, earnest, biblical preaching and teaching on the blood-bought
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:54.720]   beauty of ethnic diversity according to Revelation 5-9. The shedding of His blood—by His shed blood—Christ
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:04.880]   ransomed people from every people, language, tribe, and nation. Racial harmony and unity and love and
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:16.400]   respect and delight cost Jesus His life. Not to want it—and I say this—every church in any culture
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:25.360]   that has a history of alienation, not to want this, not to love this, not to pursue this is to belittle
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:36.480]   the blood of Jesus. Number two, let us preach and teach and counsel and converse in such searching
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:47.760]   and probing and fearless ways that we identify and name and root out every form of ethnic lovelessness.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:56.160]   Number three, let us realize that there are many different kinds of togetherness
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:04.720]   that may be appropriate for people holding significant doctrinal views. There are friendships
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:13.680]   and work relationships and conferences and conversations and seminars and ethical causes,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:22.400]   as well as various kinds of services, so we don't have to despair of any kind of connectedness with
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   people across racial lines if there happen to be certain doctrinal barriers in the way.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   Number four, let us find ways of saying to each other and to the community that if there are
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:46.640]   doctrinal convictions that create some limits of togetherness, it is not the racial differences
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:55.040]   that divide us. Let's work at finding ways to say that, make that clear. And number five, finally,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.960]   let there be an empathetic effort in our churches to know and understand the past and present
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:15.120]   streams that feed the river of present tensions. Let's not live with our head in the sand.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.400]   - So good. Thank you, Pastor John. And if you want to see how Reformed Theology relates to
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.680]   racial reconciliation, see Pastor John's book, Bloodlines. And again, if you're in Memphis or
