[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - What's the ultimate aim of the cross for me
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.960]   in the forgiveness of my sins?
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.420]   It's one of the most foundational questions
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.880]   in the world that we can ask.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.560]   And the question gets answered in a dozen different ways
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.680]   by some good answers, some poor answers,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.000]   and even some false answers as well.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.040]   And John Piper helps parse out the answers
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.680]   in a 2015 sermon to the Co-Mission Church Planning Network
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.960]   in England.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.520]   Here's how he explained it.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   Do you remember verse 18 of Romans 1
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.240]   where it said, "In unrighteousness,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.880]   "in unrighteousness, we suppress the truth
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.560]   "of God's glory and we embrace other things."
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.160]   Well, that word unrighteous is the word used
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.400]   in 1 Peter 3:18.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   Christ suffered once the righteous for the unrighteous.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.840]   So as God looks down on this tent
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.840]   and He sees hearts that prefer other things to Him,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.360]   He doesn't just get angry.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.000]   He says, "I'm gonna fix that.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.720]   "And the first thing I'm going to do
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.020]   "is put my Son as perfectly righteous
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.600]   "who never came within one whiff
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.120]   "of exchanging my glory for anything else.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.000]   "I'm gonna put my Son out there to take their place
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.660]   "and bear that anger that I feel so strongly
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.740]   "towards their idolatry.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.480]   "I'm gonna put Him in the place
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.440]   "and I'm gonna pour out my wrath on Him."
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.640]   So I'll read it again.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.080]   Christ suffered once for sins,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.840]   the righteous for the truth-suppressing,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.760]   God-exchanging unrighteous.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   And then here's the key phrase,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   "that He might bring us to God."
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.680]   That verse is paramount in my understanding of the gospel
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.360]   for this reason.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.780]   I know that there are precious truths
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.760]   that we preach in the gospel
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.980]   and terminate on them
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.600]   when they in fact are not the ultimate termination.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.860]   What I mean is this.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.600]   Christ died that my sins might be forgiven.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.280]   That's glorious.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.680]   Christ died that I might be justified
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.560]   or counted perfectly righteous
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.520]   in the presence of a holy God.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.600]   That's glorious
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.360]   and that is not the ultimate goal of the cross.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.080]   Christ died in order that His wrath might be removed.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.440]   That's glorious.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.040]   And that's not the ultimate goal of the gospel.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.880]   Christ died that I might not go to hell.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   That's really good news
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.040]   and that's not the ultimate goal of the gospel.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.720]   This verse expresses the ultimate goal of the gospel.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   I'll read it again.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.700]   Christ suffered once for sins,
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.500]   the righteous for the unrighteous,
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.800]   that He might bring us to God.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.180]   All those other things,
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.840]   forgiveness, justification,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.640]   removal of wrath,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.360]   escape from hell,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   are all means to getting to Him,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   to getting to Him.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.760]   I often ask people,
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.200]   why would you wanna be forgiven?
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.120]   Everybody's, you know,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.920]   we're singing and waving our hands,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.800]   yes, forgiven, forgiven, forgiven.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.440]   And I say, yes, yes, yes.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.280]   Why?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.560]   There are a lot of bad answers to that question.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.240]   A lot of God disanswering answers.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.360]   So if I offend my wife in the morning
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   and then at breakfast, there's ice in the air,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.840]   her back is to me, she's at the sink,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   this relationship is broken, it's my fault.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.920]   What needs to happen?
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.040]   I need to ask for forgiveness.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.520]   I need to repent.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.320]   And she needs to give me forgiveness.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.560]   Why?
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.320]   Why do I want forgiveness from her?
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.520]   Here's a bad answer.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.560]   If I don't get forgiveness,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.360]   she might not make supper for me tonight.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.320]   A lot of people answer God that way.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   Here's another bad answer.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.040]   I hate having a guilty conscience all day.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   I wanna get this fixed now
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.280]   because I don't like having a guilty conscience all day.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.480]   That's a bad answer.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.200]   It's true, it's just true, it's true.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.280]   It just has nothing to do with her value, God's value.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.720]   Christianity is good for my psychological well-being.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.960]   Thank you very much, God, take a vacation.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.120]   I've got what I want, psychological well-being.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   You get it?
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.080]   You see what's going on?
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.200]   If we don't get to God through forgiveness,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.600]   through justification, through propitiation,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.920]   through escape from hell, through removal of wrath,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.960]   if we don't get to God and love Him
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.240]   and treasure Him and own Him,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.800]   and He's everything to us, it hasn't happened.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.880]   Salvation hasn't happened.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.160]   That's what it's about.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.040]   It's about Him.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.400]   It's not about me getting forgiven,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.080]   me getting out of hell, me getting free from wrath.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.320]   It's about me getting to God.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.720]   I'm made for God.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   I'm made to know Him and love Him and be with Him
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.840]   in a fellowship that is satisfying to my soul,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.680]   and because it's satisfying to my soul,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.560]   it's glorifying to His name.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.040]   That's the end of the story.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.320]   Everything else is means.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.520]   I love this verse.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.360]   Christ suffered once for sins, my sins,
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.400]   my sins of exchanging God for other things.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.520]   He died so that I could get to Him
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   and finally discover what my treasure is,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.520]   my value in Him is.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.480]   That's the first thing that has to happen
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.680]   to restore God to the center
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.680]   is that Christ must die for our unrighteous exchange,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.840]   and He did, and that is sweet.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.480]   That's the heart of the gospel,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   but it's not the goal of the gospel.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.000]   The goal of the gospel is God.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.120]   - So good.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.000]   This message was given in England last summer
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.960]   in a series titled "Living in the Light
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.520]   "with Money, Sex, and Power,"
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.800]   a four-part series, three messages, and one Q&A.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   This was from message number three,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.720]   and all the messages are at DesiringGod.org,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.800]   and they became the new book,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   "Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power,"
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.280]   a nice little hardcover, available now at Amazon,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.840]   and downloadable free of charge at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.240]   I am your host, Tony Rehnke.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.200]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.920]   with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.800]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.960]   (upbeat music)
