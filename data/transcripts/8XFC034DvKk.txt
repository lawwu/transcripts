[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.920]   - All right, what do we got?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.960]   - Next question.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.640]   We have a question about time blocking,
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.440]   tips on, your tips on time blocking
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760]   and how he can factor that into taking some time off work
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.360]   and writing his dissertation.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.320]   - Hi Cal, my name is Carson,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.080]   long time fan, first time caller.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200]   I've taken some time away from work
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.160]   to finish my dissertation after a long hiatus
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.840]   and I'm using time blocking.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.800]   My question is this, do you have any tips for,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.480]   like when you have a tendency to not do
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.200]   what you schedule yourself to do?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.880]   I basically have three buckets
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.360]   related to the dissertation work,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.340]   research, writing and revision.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.160]   And I'll often, you know, when it's time to write,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.320]   do more research or maybe even pay the bills.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.960]   I have a feeling this may be, I'm not alone here.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.680]   Curious for your tips and thanks for all you do.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.120]   - All right, Carson.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.200]   Well, first of all, I think we're gonna now refer
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   to time blocking as, as seen on NBC's "The Today Show",
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.040]   time block planning.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.600]   That's just a little bit of branding strategy there.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.640]   Second of all, you have a fantastic voice.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.000]   So you should sell things.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   You should team up with Kobe from earlier in this episode,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.500]   who was trying to sell the stock investing tip lessons.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280]   Because Carson, if it was you reading these lessons,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040]   I think we'd all be all in, you know, you'd be like,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.420]   I want you to mortgage your house,
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.800]   invest that money into crypto.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.880]   And everyone would be like, yeah, makes sense.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.800]   Man knows what he's talking about.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.200]   I'm gonna, let me just mortgage that house over there.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.120]   So great voice, use that, use that to your advantage.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.640]   I have two things to suggest
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.800]   for what you're talking about here.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.640]   Again, very common problem.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.180]   Time blocking is hard.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.840]   Blowing past blocks or ignoring blocks
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.360]   is something that happens all the time.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280]   A lot of it has to do with what's happening in your head,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.760]   the pain of context shifting, et cetera.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.940]   I think one, schedule less.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540]   You're probably being too ambitious.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.600]   You have multiple buckets of different type of work
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.300]   you want to be doing on your dissertation.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.700]   It sounds like you're trying to do all this work every day.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220]   I think you're being too ambitious.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.420]   Your brain might be just crying uncle
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.460]   when it switches to the bills
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.880]   or becomes more linguid in its pace on the research
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.560]   and lets it overlap into the other.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.060]   So think about doing less.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.820]   Be very regular.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.640]   Gonna work on this every day,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.200]   but I'm gonna be less ambitious
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.380]   about how much I'm gonna work on.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.940]   Maybe I'm doing one thing every day.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.580]   So I just do that thing
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.420]   and I have some flexibility around it if it runs long
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.840]   and that's it for the dissertation.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.300]   Two, I'm gonna say you want to ritualize this better.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.340]   So this has to be, when I say ritual,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.960]   I mean in terms of timing, setting, and activity.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   So for something like this,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.300]   I am working on a hard long-term project.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.060]   You're gonna want to use the same times if possible,
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.520]   probably first thing in the morning.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.360]   In deep work, I have a couple examples,
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.080]   especially one in particular I'm thinking of,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   of Brian, who did his dissertation at 5 a.m.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.720]   It's like 5 a.m. to 6.30 a.m.,
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.400]   heavily ritualized every morning.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.920]   He had a full-time job.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.840]   5 a.m. to 6.30 a.m. dissertation.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.240]   And that just, the same time, same day,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.720]   was heavily ritualized.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.520]   And then setting, so where do you do this work?
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.800]   Same time, same place.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.460]   Brian had this dank office in the basement that he used,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.600]   but it was perfect because he only used it for that.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.740]   And then activity.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.480]   Again, using that same example of Brian from deep work,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.240]   he was down to a specific time he would make coffee
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.480]   and how he would make the coffee
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.960]   and when he would drink the coffee.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.840]   I believe he even had the bathroom break programmed in,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.720]   so it was very ritualized activity.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.720]   All of this, all of this, what it does
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.160]   is break down the context-switching cost in your brain.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.340]   It makes it much easier for your brain to,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.760]   A, not have to negotiate with itself, should we work now?
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.420]   It's a hard argument, waste energy, you might lose it,
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.140]   so just take that off the table.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.540]   And B, the rituals get you into that mode quicker
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.920]   so you don't have as much of an expensive
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.020]   context-shift operation happening.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.980]   So you waste less energy on that, you get into it quicker,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.740]   you get into it easier.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.860]   So do less and to be much more ritualized
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.620]   about the work you do.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.180]   It's a core principle of slow productivity
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.860]   is change the scale at which you're looking
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.580]   for accomplishment to be longer.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.060]   So it's not what did I get done today?
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.100]   It's am I happy with the chapter I produced this month?
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.560]   You're going to a larger time scale.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   And then it's just about clean, deep,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   reasonable, sustainable work again and again.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600]   Head down, the wheel is grinding,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.120]   you look up three months later and say,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.020]   hey, this first part of my dissertation looks pretty good.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.560]   All right, what do we have for our fourth call, Jesse?
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   - Before we get to the fourth call,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.720]   I loved how Carson was first time caller.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.220]   You get that a lot in sports talk radio.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.840]   - I know, well, which again,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.320]   we should do live calls at some point.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.600]   I mean, maybe we would regret that.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   - I just love the first time caller,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.520]   first time long time, you hear it all the time.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.160]   I feel I've heard a few times,
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.560]   like listening to some of your listener calls.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.120]   I love it. - I do enjoy it.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.520]   And also the thing I want to do is
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.920]   we should do one of these live, do it actually live
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   and we should do it the morning
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.640]   after an important Nationals game
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.000]   and just let it devolve into sports talk radio.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.380]   We would be swimming in fans if it just became calls,
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.720]   long discussions, long discussions about the Nationals.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.900]   (upbeat music)
