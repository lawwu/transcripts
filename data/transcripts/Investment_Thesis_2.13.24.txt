[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.140]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.600]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.080]   And in this episode, I want to talk
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.880]   about overcoming your fear of investing
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.720]   by coming up with an investment thesis.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.040]   I've been investing since 1996, when I had my first Ameritrade
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.000]   account.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.800]   Made some money, lost a bunch of money,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.920]   made a lot of money during the first dot-com boom,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.840]   and then subsequently lost a lot of money.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.160]   So I've been going up and down this roller
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.040]   coaster for a while now.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.800]   But thankfully, thanks to the bull market,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280]   it's generally gone well.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.680]   Now over time, over the years since I
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.600]   started writing on Financial Samurai in 2009,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.720]   I have noticed some people who are unwilling to put
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.700]   their capital into risk assets like stocks, real estate,
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.680]   or any other type of asset that has no guaranteed return.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.560]   As a result, over time, they fall behind inflation.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.080]   Inflation has been recently running at about 3%, 3.5%.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.880]   It was as high as 9.1% in mid-2022.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.680]   So over time, the value of your cash,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.480]   which generally pays less than inflation, gets whittled away.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.720]   And that's not good.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.520]   Inflation right now is probably a top three financial issue
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.160]   for the American public.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.440]   And the only way to overcome inflation
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.640]   is by investing long-term in risk assets such as stocks,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.900]   real estate, and more.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.880]   When I was in my 20s and early 30s,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.640]   I was a very active trader, wild trader, undisciplined trader.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.240]   If I saw a 10% gain, oftentimes I would just sell.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.040]   And then I would pay short-term capital gains tax.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.080]   And then over time, after I racked up many, many trades
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.280]   and also had to do my taxes at the end of the year
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.900]   where I had to consolidate those trades
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.360]   and see how much I made and lost,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.520]   I realized I was wasting a lot of time
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.320]   going in and out of securities.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.400]   Sometimes I made money.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.720]   Sometimes I lost money.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.000]   Or sometimes I just broke even.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.360]   What a waste of time.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.200]   And it was a career-limiting move for me
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.560]   because instead of focusing on my job,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.720]   I was almost hooked to trading in the markets
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.680]   because I was sitting on the trading floor.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.480]   Over time, I learned to buy and hold
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.720]   because as the old saying goes, time in the market
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.440]   is better than timing the market.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.880]   I learned this the hard way through admonishments
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   by my manager, who came out from New York City and asked,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.360]   what the hell are you doing?
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.660]   You've got to focus on your job.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.120]   I see all your trades.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.880]   Focus.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.440]   And it took a lot of energy to focus,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.200]   probably because I was hooked.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.920]   I was probably addicted to trading.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.560]   But this time, I knew that if I didn't stop,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040]   my career would be at risk.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   The most important strategy I came up with to holding
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.440]   long-term was to come up with an investment
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   thesis for any single investment I wanted to buy
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   and any investment I had held that I continued
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.760]   to want to hold.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.400]   The great thing about coming up with an investment thesis
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.240]   is that you don't have to be a financial analyst
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   to come up with one.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.180]   You just have to think logically about the future.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.000]   Let me give you some examples.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.640]   Back in 2012, when I negotiated a severance package
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.200]   from my job of 11 years and my career of 13 years
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.920]   in investment banking, I was not 100% certain I
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.440]   was doing the right thing.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.360]   It was a multiple six-figure salary plus bonus.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.600]   And I was only 34 years old.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.080]   So what I did was I said, OK, I'm done with finance.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.200]   I have a severance package.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.600]   I have the opportunity to see what else is out there.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.400]   So I ended up with no connections
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.080]   applying to tech jobs from Apple to Facebook
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.760]   to Google to Airbnb.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.160]   And I basically got shut out.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.860]   I either got ignored or I got a kind no over email.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.780]   And this is the problem with applying to jobs
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.280]   with no connections.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.200]   You're just sending resumes in a black hole.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.320]   But I took the no's and the rejections in stride
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.160]   because at the time, I was focused on early retirement,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.700]   traveling with my wife, and also writing on Financial Samurai.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.880]   I just didn't want to have any regrets saying
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.780]   I didn't try to at least apply to these tech companies, which
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.400]   I thought were the future when I look back.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.760]   And so I don't have any regrets.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.560]   I tried.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.680]   I failed.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.720]   There you go.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.040]   But I did come up with an investment thesis.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.200]   And that investment thesis in 2012
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.920]   was if I am not good enough to even get an interview,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.640]   let alone a job at one of these tech companies,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.660]   then these tech companies must be pretty good.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.480]   So maybe this was a coping mechanism.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.960]   But I said, you know what?
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.600]   I am going to invest in these tech companies instead.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.400]   So in 2012, I started buying about $10,000 to $20,000
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.280]   worth of Apple, Facebook, Google.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.920]   And then I turned the situation around.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.840]   And I said, if I can't work for you,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.200]   you are going to work for me as a shareholder.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.760]   And as long as I held these stocks,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.480]   I am technically the boss.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.400]   I'm the shareholder.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   You work for me.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.920]   I'm the captain now.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.880]   12 years later, these holdings have done well.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.760]   They've been able to grow large enough
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.360]   to provide for my family in terms of college education,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   and even to buy some property.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.920]   It's been a great ride.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.480]   Now, of course, 2012 was close to the bottom
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.640]   of the bear market, right?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.080]   So a lot of this has to do with luck.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.520]   However, if you look at all the historical data regarding
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.080]   at least holding the S&P 500 since 1926,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   the average compound return is about 10%.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.320]   And if you hold the S&P 500 for at least 10 years,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.200]   the average probability of making money is over 95%.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.080]   And then once you're at about 18 to 19 years,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.680]   the percentage win rate is 100%.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.800]   So time in the market, very important.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.400]   Now, with Apple stock, for example,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.240]   I didn't know that it was going to outperform.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   But I felt that with the people they hired,
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.440]   with their technology, with their inventions,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440]   it would outperform.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.840]   And it did outperform dramatically.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.920]   So what now, 12 years later, for example, with Apple stock?
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.080]   And this is not investment advice for you.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.000]   This is an example of what I'm doing
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.560]   and how I come up with the investment thesis.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.800]   With the S&P 500 at about 5,000,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.760]   it's at an all-time high, more or less.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.800]   And so it's been hard for me to put new money
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.680]   to work in stocks.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.820]   However, when Apple came out with its new Vision Pro,
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.000]   I got excited, I was interested.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.120]   Approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.240]   experience some form of visual impairment,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.040]   while an estimated 237 million face
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   moderate to severe impairment.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.960]   And among them, 40 million are considered legally blind
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.320]   or completely blind.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.200]   And for those who don't know,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.400]   the definition of legally blind means
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.160]   the inability to correct your visual acuity
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.340]   to at least 2,200 with corrective lenses,
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.000]   such as contact lenses or glasses.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.280]   Most people can correct their visual acuity
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   to 2,020 to 2,040 with glasses or contacts.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.400]   Legally blind usually does not mean complete blindness.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.880]   There is a field of vision.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.200]   It just means you can't correct to 2,020 to 2,040.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.880]   Now, what does it mean, 2,200 or 2,040?
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.160]   So if someone has 2,200 vision,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.760]   it means that they can only see clearly the details
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.960]   20 feet away what someone can see 200 feet away.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   Again, this is after using corrective lenses,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.560]   such as contacts or glasses.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.140]   I think about vision a lot because someone dear to me
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.360]   has a visual impairment and I wanna help him
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.000]   see the world, learn and interact with others
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.560]   as much as possible.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.760]   In fact, if there's one minority group
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.640]   that I'm fighting for the most,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.320]   it's the minority group with disabilities.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.920]   Roughly 15% of the world's population
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.560]   has some sort of disability, either mild to severe.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.660]   And I firmly believe this is the minority group
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.600]   that the world needs to fight for,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.400]   for equal access, equality, equity.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.560]   My investment thesis with Apple stock now is
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.480]   the Vision Pro is a defining technology
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.960]   that will help the world see better,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.120]   connect better and experience the world better.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.080]   I watched a bunch of demos online as maybe you have.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.320]   And then I took my wife to the Apple store.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.840]   We made a date out of it.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.920]   We first had hot pot lunch
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.840]   and then we registered online for an appointment.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.240]   And then we did the demo, 30 minutes.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.580]   And it was an unbelievable experience.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.520]   The immersion, the clarity, the 3D videos.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.560]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.600]   It blew me away.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.360]   It brought tears to my eyes.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.440]   It was that amazing.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.040]   During the entire 30 minute demo,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.640]   all I could think about was how this tool,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.720]   the Vision Pro could significantly improve
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.280]   accessibility for the visually impaired.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.400]   The experience of the Vision Pro was equally,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.560]   if not more impactful than when I first got
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.640]   a BlackBerry device and I could type an email
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.560]   and maybe surf the web a little bit.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.400]   That was a pretty defining moment.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   It was similar to 1997 when I discovered Yahoo
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.360]   in the college computer labs.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.920]   Wow, the internet, unbelievable.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.080]   But actually, the Vision Pro blows past
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.920]   any new experience I've ever had with technology.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.000]   It's not even close.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.080]   Now, are there negatives?
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.680]   Yes, the price point, $3,500.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   Only the most gung-ho early adopters
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.160]   will buy the Vision Pro.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.620]   And also, it's heavy.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.680]   So after about 30 minutes, definitely after about an hour,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.960]   the fit might start weighing on your head and forehead.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.900]   You've got to get that right fit going.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   But it is clear to me the Vision Pro version 2, 3, 4
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.320]   is gonna get better and better.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.440]   More apps are gonna be created
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.520]   and the world is gonna be better connected
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.040]   and more people will be able to experience
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.440]   and see the world better.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   So what am I gonna do with my Apple shares
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.820]   that I've held for 12 plus years?
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.280]   I'm just gonna keep holding them.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.960]   In fact, since the stock has sold off from its $198 high,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.140]   I'm gonna be nibbling on some more
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.840]   because I do believe in this investment thesis
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.360]   of helping the visually impaired see better.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.880]   Let me share with you another example
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.200]   of how coming up with an investment thesis
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.640]   has helped me make a decision on my old home.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.120]   Now, I had a decision whether to sell it
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   and pay those commissions and taxes, fees, or rent it out.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.960]   In my heart, as a 46-year-old man who is tired
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.020]   taking care of two young children and writing a lot,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.320]   I don't want to own another investment property.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.120]   I wanna simplify life,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.480]   not have to deal with the maintenance hassles
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.000]   and tenant inquiries and so forth.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.560]   However, I came up with an investment thesis
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.320]   to help me make a decision because selling in 2024,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.320]   I think is a mistake in terms of selling real estate
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.200]   because I think rates will gradually come down.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.120]   I think real estate is gonna catch up
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.240]   to the performance of stocks.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.220]   And I think there's gonna be a boom,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.700]   at least here in San Francisco.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.660]   First of all, tech stocks since the beginning of 2023
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.780]   have seen a tremendous rise in performance.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.300]   We've got everything from Google, Facebook, Apple up 30%
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.200]   to 70%, Nvidia continues to climb.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.580]   Second of all, there is an artificial intelligence boom
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.100]   here in San Francisco.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.820]   Check out The Economist's profile
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.300]   on how San Francisco has made a comeback.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.080]   AI companies, the largest ones are all here.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.680]   We're talking open AI, Anthropic, Databricks.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.760]   And it was interesting because I was invited
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.240]   to invest a hundred grand or more
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   in the latest fundraising for Anthropic,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.040]   a company that's only three years old
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.000]   and they were raising at a $15 billion valuation.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.440]   So that's from nothing to $15 billion in three years.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.520]   And there are many smaller AI companies
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.800]   doing the same thing.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.200]   I'm sitting here folks in ground zero.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   I'm talking to everyone.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.220]   I'm a limited partner at several top funds,
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.920]   venture capital funds.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.180]   And it is obvious to me, 70 plus percent of new startups
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.480]   it seems are doing AI or have some AI type of focus
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.640]   and the venture capital money is going there.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.400]   Now, it feels a little bubblicious, right?
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.880]   Based on valuations, based on how much revenue
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.720]   is being generated, based on the valuation of the company.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.040]   It obviously seems very bubblicious,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.960]   just like in 2000, 2021.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.080]   However, the momentum is there.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   And I think we can agree that AI is gonna transform
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.220]   productivity, companies, technology for decades to come.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.200]   And I wanna be here as this transformation happens
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.320]   because I was here in the early 2000s.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.640]   When Facebook, when Google, when public,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.520]   my firm was part of the tombstone
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.720]   where we helped take these companies public
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.240]   and it transformed the landscape.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.760]   It made thousands of people very wealthy
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.260]   and the real estate market did very well subsequently.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.960]   I've been a landlord since 2005, right?
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.600]   2005, I've gone through many, many sets of tenants
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.760]   and the majority of my tenants,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   about 65 to 70% of them, all hailed from tech companies.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.560]   And I've seen their incomes
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.360]   because that's what I've gotta do as a landlord.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.840]   I've got to vet them financially.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   And it seems very clear to me that this boom in wealth,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.640]   thanks to big tech and now AI,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.320]   is gonna happen again in 2023, 2024 and beyond.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   So in 20 years, when my kids are 24 and 26 1/2 years old,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.920]   I don't want them coming back to me and saying,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   dad, why did you sell that property back in 2024?
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.200]   When you could have just rented it out and ridden the boom,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.220]   the boom in the San Francisco market
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.560]   because of the boom in technology and AI.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.000]   I don't want them telling me that
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.580]   because owning these single-family homes
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.360]   with ocean views on the west side of San Francisco
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.480]   is something that I can control.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.520]   Being able to get a job at one of these booming companies
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.960]   is something I cannot control.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   I don't have the technical expertise
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.360]   or the connections to land these jobs
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.760]   or start these type of startups.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.040]   It's just not me.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.080]   So now I've got two components of my investment thesis down.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.880]   Tech booming, AI just getting started, that's number one.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.080]   And two, thinking about the future
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.720]   where my children inquisitively ask,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.480]   why did you sell back in 2024
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.280]   when you could have just held on for the next 20 years
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.360]   and ridden the boom in that derivative way?
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.240]   If you held on, we could have had affordable living.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.060]   But no, now we've got to pay $15,000 a month
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.440]   for a one-bedroom apartment in a bad part of town.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.480]   Dad, why did you sell?
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.600]   So now I'm thinking to myself, okay, rent or sell.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.080]   Gosh, selling just doesn't seem
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.400]   like the right time right now.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.740]   And then here's the final part of the investment thesis
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.240]   for why I should rent out the property.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.880]   The west side of San Francisco is booming
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.720]   due to a couple factors.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.800]   One, there's gonna be an opening of a new school
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.520]   called the Chinese American International School
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   on 19th Avenue across from Stonestown Mall, September 2024.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.380]   The school has over 500 students
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.720]   and it's gonna be on a 5.2 acre campus.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.800]   It's gonna be the best campus in San Francisco
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.440]   because it's gonna be the largest
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.400]   with the most amount of facilities
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.480]   and it's gonna be fully renovated.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.440]   It goes from preschool three through the eighth grade.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.280]   So every single year, there's gonna be
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.600]   about 60 new kids joining the school.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.440]   And that means every single year,
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.240]   30 to 60 families probably are going to have to look
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.920]   for property on the west side of San Francisco
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.480]   relatively near the campus.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.280]   I would say within three miles.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.720]   And when you have a perpetual installed base of demand
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.840]   every single year for probably forever,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.560]   that is good for single family home property prices
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.960]   on the west side of San Francisco near the school
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.840]   because the home we used to own
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.520]   is within a couple miles of the school
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.880]   and it's a single family house
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.520]   that we would have happily raised our children in
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.280]   for the next 10 years.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.600]   It was just that real estate FOMO got the best of me in 2023
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   and I decided to buy another house.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.580]   But this is a topic for another conversation.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.980]   And then there's another catalyst
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.800]   for the west side of San Francisco.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.440]   And that's the $4 billion plus remodeling
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   of UCSF Parnassus Hospital and Research Center.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.840]   I drive by it every time I send my kids to school
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.280]   and it is a sight to behold how much remodeling they've done
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.960]   on the top of this hill.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.960]   And in 2030, once the remodeling is done,
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.100]   this is the estimate,
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.440]   the new hospital will be able to accommodate
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.600]   1,200 to 1,400 new jobs.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.140]   1,200 to 1,400 new jobs just in this surrounding area
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.660]   on the west side of San Francisco, that's a lot of jobs.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.700]   That means more demand for housing,
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.360]   more demand for coffee shops, restaurants, hardware stores,
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.600]   all this, these are local economic catalysts
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.200]   that are clearly planned out,
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.880]   that will clearly happen over the next five to 10
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.740]   to multi-decade years.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.920]   And given there's already a housing shortage
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.680]   and it's very tough to build new housing in San Francisco,
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.980]   I see real estate prices on the west side of San Francisco,
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.520]   the more affordable side of San Francisco
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.860]   continuing to go up over the next couple of decades.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.440]   Once I put all these points together
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.660]   for my investment thesis, I said, you know what?
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.880]   I'm just gonna hold, save my money
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.560]   in terms of paying that commission dollars
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.280]   because also I believe brokerage commissions
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.840]   will come down over time.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.040]   Please check out the previous episode I did
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.160]   interviewing Mike Ketchmark, the trial attorney
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.040]   who won the case against the National Association
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.800]   of Realtors for price fixing and real estate collusion.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.960]   Again, I prefer not to be a landlord to another property.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.800]   However, based on my investment thesis, I cannot sell now
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.640]   because I'm gonna regret it, I think 10, 20 years from now.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.600]   The next time I have some type of tenant
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.320]   or maintenance issue to make myself feel better,
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.920]   I'm just gonna revert back to my investment thesis
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.360]   that will force me to just do the work,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.720]   stop complaining and get on with it.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.840]   Now, owning this rental property doesn't preclude me
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.880]   from investing more passively,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.640]   such as in private real estate funds,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.280]   in real estate ETFs and so forth.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.880]   It's not mutually exclusive.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.120]   I will continue to do that
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.840]   because I want to focus more on passive income.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.640]   Now, the tricky thing about coming up
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.320]   with an investment thesis is that you could get
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   your investment thesis right, but your investment wrong.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.440]   And you can get your investment thesis wrong,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.280]   but still make money on your investment.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.160]   There are multivariables that are included
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.480]   in an investment decision and you can't get them all right.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.520]   Many factors are at play here.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.080]   Sometimes you just get lucky.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.760]   But as we talked about at the beginning of the show,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.960]   the longer you stay invested,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.080]   generally the higher the probability
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.360]   you're gonna have a positive outcome.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.800]   So in conclusion, I wanted to share how to come up
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.960]   with a good investment thesis.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.480]   There are 12 points.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.920]   One, make it clear and concise.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.720]   If you can't explain your investment thesis clearly
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.960]   to a friend or a loved one, then you're not doing it right.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   Two, it should be supported by research.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.800]   Three, it should be aligned with your goals.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.560]   Four, should identify investment opportunities
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.920]   here and there, right?
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.000]   You have to look for what people are missing,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.680]   connect the dots.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.600]   Five, you should analyze all the risks, right?
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.480]   Not only should you have blue sky and realistic scenarios,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.360]   you should have downside scenarios as well.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.040]   What if this is a bomb?
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.240]   What if this doesn't turn out?
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.920]   Six, you should have a time horizon.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.080]   How long are you willing to invest in this asset?
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.240]   Or how long are you willing to give in your investment
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.800]   before you change your mind
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   because management didn't come through with something?
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.680]   You should understand the company's competitive advantage
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.160]   or the city's competitive advantage
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.280]   or whatever asset class's competitive advantage.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.360]   You should understand the financial metrics.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.800]   That's eight.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.960]   Nine, you should run different scenarios.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.200]   This is scenario analysis.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.800]   10, your investment thesis should be adaptable and dynamic.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.200]   Always review your investment thesis every six months,
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.760]   12 years to make sure it's still on track.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.520]   If it's not on track, then you've got to adjust accordingly.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.520]   11, you should have an exit strategy.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.320]   At what price point will you sell
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.560]   if the stock gets to a certain level or valuation level?
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.800]   Or at what period of time are you gonna sell
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.240]   because you're 70 years old and you're seriously tired
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.520]   and you wanna enjoy the rest of your life?
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.480]   And then finally, you should communicate
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.000]   your investment thesis to not just your friends
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.840]   and loved ones, to more people, maybe strangers,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.120]   maybe just acquaintances while you see them
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.640]   on the playground or the tennis court
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.240]   and see what they have to say
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.160]   because they will help uncover some blind spots.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.000]   The more blind spots you uncover,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   the more you're ready to take action
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.880]   and hedge against bad things happening.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.840]   All right, everyone, I hope you enjoyed this solo episode
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.440]   of me talking about how I think about investing
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.480]   and how you can overcome the fear of investing.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.520]   If you come up with that investment thesis,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.040]   I promise you, you'll feel better about investing
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.480]   and you'll feel better about holding
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.120]   over bad times and during good times.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.400]   If you enjoyed this episode,
