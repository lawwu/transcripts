[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.240]   Landon, a seminary student, writes in to ask this,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.600]   "Pastor John, I struggle with envy towards a brother
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.580]   "and a dear friend in Christ who has received
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.960]   "abundant gifts and opportunities from the Lord
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.920]   "in this life that I simply have not.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.700]   "Many times it can become very difficult not to question
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.640]   "whether God loves my friend more than he loves me.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.860]   "Does God delight in some of his children
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.440]   "more than others?"
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.140]   - I'm gonna answer that with a yes or no in just a minute,
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.520]   but let me say at the beginning,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.520]   I think there's a good deal of confusion about this
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.380]   because of an unbiblical overplay or overextension
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.600]   of the doctrine of justification.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.500]   That is, drawing out inferences from justification
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.600]   that the Bible does not draw.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   Like, since God sees me in Christ
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.060]   and his perfect righteousness as his child,
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.960]   therefore, he sees all his children the same
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.300]   with the same emotional response to each one
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.520]   because each one is perfect in Christ.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   Now, that, I say, is an unbiblical overextension,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.720]   overplay of the doctrine of justification.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.720]   It needs to be corrected by scripture instead of logic.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.680]   God does not have the same emotional response
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.020]   to all his children.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.200]   What the imputation of the righteousness of Christ means
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   is that God does not see my sin as any longer condemning me.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.920]   There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.280]   My sins are all forgiven,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   and the perfection that God's standards call for are met,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.840]   and I will never come into condemnation.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.240]   That's what justification means.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.640]   That does not mean that God does not see my sin
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.600]   and my obedience and feel differently about each one.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.760]   God is pleased with my obedience,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.420]   and he's grieved by my sin.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.100]   That's abundantly clear in the language
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.800]   of the New Testament letters, Ephesians 4:30,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.280]   to not grieve the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.400]   or positively, children, obey your parents in everything,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.320]   for this pleases the Lord,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.820]   or 1 Thessalonians 4, I wrote to you
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.220]   how you ought to walk and to please God.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.220]   These are justified people who please God more or less.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.000]   So the answer to Landon's question,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.100]   does God delight in some of his children
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.960]   more than others, is yes,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.400]   and he delights in you some days
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   more than he delights in you other days.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   And we should heed Paul's exhortation in Ephesians 5,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.400]   try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.240]   Ephesians 5, 10, that is,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.840]   try to discern what delights the Lord
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   so you can be as fully delightful to him as possible.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.740]   But Landon's question went in a different direction.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.540]   When a brother has superior gifts to mine,
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.740]   is this a sign that God delights in him more than me?
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.540]   That's a different question.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.820]   And the answer to that is no, no.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.020]   That's not what those gifts mean.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.020]   God chose the worst man he could find on the planet
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.680]   to give the greatest gift of apostleship to,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.840]   Paul the murderer, so that it would be clear
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.460]   these gifts were owing to mercy, not merit.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.960]   When Paul describes the gifts that Christians have,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   he's at pains in 1 Corinthians 12
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   and the writer of Hebrews 2,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.640]   he's at pains to show that they are owing
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.120]   to his free sovereignty and not to our superior delightfulness.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.440]   So listen to 1 Corinthians 12, 11.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   All these gifts are empowered by one in the same spirit
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.520]   who apportions to each one individually as he wills.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.880]   And the point is he's free,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.600]   he does it in ways that are above what you can think.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.960]   So don't try to figure him out why he gives
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.680]   to one this and to one that.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.240]   Or Hebrews 2, chapter four,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.960]   God bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.760]   by gifts of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.160]   distributed according to his will.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.920]   And if we start to ask,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.520]   but can a person with greater gifts please God
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.440]   more than one with lesser gifts?
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.480]   The answer is absolutely not.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.660]   Why?
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.480]   Because what pleases God is not that one can preach
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.960]   and another can pray,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.880]   or one can write and another can work with his hands.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   What pleases God is how we use our gifts,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.400]   not which ones we have.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.440]   That's the point of the parable of the talents.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.240]   Well done, good and faithful servant is not reserved
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.640]   for the man who got the most,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   but for those who were faithful.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   Here's an illustration.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.900]   This moved me deeply years ago.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.040]   So helped me as a younger pastor.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.800]   Billy Graham came to town here.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.480]   His headquarters used to be here in Minneapolis.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.040]   And he came to town and he gave a chapel address
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.600]   to all the employees over at the Billy Graham Association.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.320]   And lots of those folks went to our church.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.360]   And so one of them, a secretarial person,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.840]   told me this story.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.240]   He said to them in chapel that he expected
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.500]   some of them would receive greater rewards
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.600]   in heaven than he would.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.860]   When they responded skeptically, which they did,
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.680]   he could see it on their faces,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.440]   he became very serious, she said,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.960]   and said, "Do you not understand
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.960]   that God rewards faithfulness, not fruitfulness?"
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.520]   Oh, that line just made a huge difference for me.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.920]   The faithful use of a small gift elicits more delight
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.780]   in God than the poor use of a huge gift.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.480]   So envy, that's the question here.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.080]   How to get over this envy.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.560]   Envy is a trust issue.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.720]   Do we believe that God is good and strong and wise
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.600]   and gives gifts in the very best, wisest way
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.960]   for his glory and for our joy?
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.000]   Or do we wanna say to God,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.960]   "Well, I would have given them out differently
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.680]   and done a better job of it."
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.440]   No, we don't wanna say that.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.560]   It's a trust issue and he's worthy of our trust.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.920]   So preach to yourself the sovereign goodness
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.440]   and wisdom of God in the gifting of his people
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.200]   and preach the freeness of his grace in doing it.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.280]   - That's very, very good.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.960]   And thank you, Landon, for the honest question.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.600]   For more on envy and jealousy,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.040]   see episodes number 151 and 152 in this podcast.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   They are respectively titled,

[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   Well, when we pray to our triune God,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.540]   should we pray to the Father or to the Son
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.160]   or to the Holy Spirit?
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.400]   It's a very common question
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.160]   and tomorrow I'll ask Pastor John.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.560]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
