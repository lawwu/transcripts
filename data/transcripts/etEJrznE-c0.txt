[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.180]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.300]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.880]   My guest today is Dr. David Yeager.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280]   Dr. David Yeager is a professor of psychology
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.560]   at the University of Texas at Austin,
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   and one of the world's leading researchers into mindsets,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.640]   in particular, growth mindset,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.480]   which is a mindset that enables people of all ages
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.400]   to improve their abilities at essentially anything.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.120]   He is also a world expert
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.420]   into the stress-is-performance-enhancing mindset,
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.020]   which is a mindset that allows people
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.240]   to cognitively reframe stress,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.440]   and that when combined with growth mindset
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.880]   can lead to dramatic improvements in performance
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.040]   in cognitive and physical endeavors.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.540]   Dr. Yeager is also the author
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.140]   of an important and extremely useful new book
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.580]   entitled "10 to 25, the Science of Motivating Young People."
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.480]   The book is scheduled for release this summer,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.520]   that is the summer of 2024,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.100]   and we've provided a link to the book
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.540]   in the show note captions.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.600]   During today's discussion,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.240]   Dr. Yeager explains to us exactly what growth mindset is
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840]   through the lens of the research into growth mindset,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.960]   and he explains also how to apply growth mindset
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.040]   in our lives.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.700]   He also shares the research from his and other laboratories
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.400]   on the stress-can-be-performance-enhancing mindset
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.000]   and how that can be combined with growth mindset
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.920]   to achieve the maximum results.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.060]   So while I assume that most people
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.540]   have heard of growth mindset,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.180]   today's discussion will allow you
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.100]   to really apply it in your life,
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.220]   not just from the perspective of you,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.660]   the person trying to learn,
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.020]   but also for teachers and coaches.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.180]   In fact, Dr. Yeager shares
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.860]   not just the optimal learning environments
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.180]   for us as individuals,
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.700]   but also between individuals and in the classroom,
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.820]   in families, in sports teams,
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.260]   and in groups of all sizes and kinds.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.020]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.700]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.760]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.400]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.480]   Our first sponsor is AeroPress.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.080]   AeroPress is like a French press,
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.480]   but a French press that always brews
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.760]   the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.200]   meaning no bitterness and excellent taste.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.280]   AeroPress achieves this
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.440]   because it uses a very short contact time
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.160]   between the hot water and the coffee,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.840]   and that short contact time also means
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.400]   that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.420]   The whole thing takes only about three minutes.
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.860]   I started using AeroPress over 10 years ago,
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.180]   and I learned about it from a guy named Allen Adler,
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.980]   who's a former Stanford engineer, who's also an inventor.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.960]   He developed things like the Arobi Frisbee.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.260]   In any event, I'm a big fan of Adler inventions,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.180]   and when I heard he developed a coffee maker, the AeroPress,
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.380]   I tried it, and I found that, indeed,
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.700]   it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.900]   It's also extremely small and portable,
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.580]   so I started using it in the laboratory
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.740]   when I travel on the road, and also at home.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.700]   And I'm not alone in my love of the AeroPress coffee maker.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.340]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.320]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.620]   If you'd like to try AeroPress,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.280]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.780]   AeroPress currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.960]   and to over 60 other countries around the world.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.220]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.500]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.900]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.820]   Now, I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.540]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.420]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.420]   with an enormous number of different challenges
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.280]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.460]   Roka understands this
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.660]   and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.700]   so that regardless of the conditions you're in,
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   you always see with the utmost clarity.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.100]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.020]   for use in sport,
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.540]   in particular things like running and cycling.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.340]   Now, as a consequence, Roka frames are extremely lightweight,
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.660]   so much so that most of the time,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.920]   you don't even remember that they're on your face.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.100]   They're also designed so that they don't slip off
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.340]   if you get sweaty.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.920]   Now, even though they were initially designed
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.180]   for performance in sport,
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360]   they now have many different frames and styles,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.440]   all of which can be used in sport,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.460]   but also when out to dinner, at work,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.700]   essentially any time and in any setting.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.140]   If you'd like to try Roka glasses,
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.460]   you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.260]   and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.480]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.260]   and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.500]   And now for my discussion with Dr. David Yeager.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.540]   Dr. David Yeager, welcome.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.040]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.740]   - Can you tell us your definition of growth mindset?
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.260]   I think most people have heard of it.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.180]   They have some sense of what it is,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.060]   but you've worked very intensely on growth mindset
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.760]   for a number of years.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.260]   So I'd love to know how you define it.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.860]   - Yeah, so it's simply the belief that your abilities
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.200]   or your potential in some domain can change.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.420]   A huge confusion is people think it means
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.060]   if you try hard, then you can do anything,
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.340]   but that's not really the idea.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.640]   It's simply that under the right conditions
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.500]   with the right support, change is possible.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.340]   And that ends up being a pretty powerful idea
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.300]   because the opposite is so stressful, right?
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.860]   The idea that you are static,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.380]   nothing about you can change
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.560]   is really kind of a stressful idea.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.300]   - Of all the studies on growth mindset,
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.660]   including yours, the ones that you've participated in,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.580]   what one or two kind of high-level results
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.500]   stand out to you as the most striking,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.220]   surprising, exciting, or meaningful?
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.900]   And here, I will encourage you to discard with attribution.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.380]   We know that, or everyone should know,
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.280]   that Carol Dweck is the originator
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.320]   of the growth mindset idea as a field,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.040]   and she deserves tremendous credit for that.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.080]   So when you stand back from the field,
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.520]   given that it's mushroomed into this very large field now,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.960]   and you look at that research,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.800]   which results kind of stand out as like,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.200]   wow, that's really cool, really meaningful.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.680]   People should know about that.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.160]   - What stands out to me a lot, first of all,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.800]   is just the field experiments,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   that the idea that you can distill a complex idea
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.080]   about the brain, about malleability,
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.840]   you can give it to a young person
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   at a time when they're vulnerable,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   and that that can give them hope,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.520]   and then they can do better at school or whatever.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   So our 2019 paper in "Nature"
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.280]   that Carol, Greg Walton, Angela Duckworth,
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.060]   a lot of us collaborated on,
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.480]   took a very short growth mindset intervention,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.440]   two sessions, about 25 minutes each, for ninth graders,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.940]   and we found kids were, eight, nine months later,
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.560]   more likely to get good grades.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.700]   By 10th grade, more likely to be in the hard math classes,
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.240]   and the unpublished results find effects four years later
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.180]   on graduating high school with college-ready courses
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.800]   from a short intervention that happened
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.400]   just one or two times, no reinforcement.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.540]   So there's a lot of reasons why that's true.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.720]   That sounds magical and outrageous,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.760]   and there are a lot of mechanisms,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.920]   but that just demonstrates the overall value
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.040]   of the phenomenon, and in that study,
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.940]   we did everything we possibly could
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.640]   to address legitimate skepticism, right?
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.480]   Are we collecting and processing the data
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.520]   in ways that could bias it?
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.800]   No, third party.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.500]   Is it, are we handpicking schools
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.180]   where you could get the best effects?
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.320]   No, random sample of schools.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.440]   Did we post-talk, decide on the analyses
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   that would make the results look the greatest?
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.640]   No, preregistered.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   So that's a good, like, okay,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.640]   this phenomenon is not something
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.900]   that falls apart in the hands of anyone else
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.620]   besides a select few researchers.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.760]   That's really, and we can go into that,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.300]   but that doesn't explain the mechanisms,
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.360]   and I think that there are a lot
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.120]   of interesting growth mindset mechanism studies.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   My personal favorite is a very underappreciated,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.440]   kind of like indie rock study by David Nussbaum
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.600]   and Carol Dweck that David did
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.760]   when he was a graduate student at Stanford,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.880]   and it's on defensiveness versus remediation.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.800]   And the basic idea is, in a fixed mindset,
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.760]   the idea that your intelligence cannot change,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.800]   you are the way you are, it can't change.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.160]   Your goal in that fixed mindset is to defend your ego,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.000]   to, like, hide your deficiencies or any flaws,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.380]   because if they're fixed and then they're revealed,
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.360]   then it labels you for life in some way
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.340]   as less than, shameworthy, et cetera, right?
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.320]   In a growth mindset, though,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.840]   a mistake is, like, part of the process.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.360]   It's just an opportunity to grow.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.880]   So David took that idea and then set up a study,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.520]   and I think I have the details right,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.300]   where undergraduates did a task.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.600]   They all did poorly.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.640]   They were getting 20, 30% correct on this task,
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.820]   and the question is, what do you do
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.780]   before you do your second try?
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.060]   How do you cope with that initial failure?
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.060]   And he found that both fixed-in-mindset participants
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.220]   wanted to recover their self-esteem.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.180]   So you do poorly, you feel like crap,
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.620]   what am I gonna do to feel better about myself?
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.460]   In a fixed mindset, they looked downward.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.420]   So the people getting a 25,
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.480]   look at the people who got a 12.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.200]   Like, I'm twice as good as these losers, right?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.680]   In a growth mindset, they look at the people
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.240]   getting an 85 or 90.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.080]   What are they doing?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.900]   What are their strategies?
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.960]   How can I improve?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.620]   Both of them then recovered self-esteem
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.780]   and looked the same at post-test.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.980]   And I think about that a lot.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.180]   Like, how often in our society does something happen to us
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.300]   and we feel like garbage, and you have a choice?
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.500]   Like, am I gonna look down on other people
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.100]   and say, at least I'm not as bad as these losers?
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.900]   Or am I gonna say, like, how am I gonna get better?
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.600]   And I love that because think of a ninth grader
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.820]   who bombs their algebra test.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.660]   Am I like a no-good, dumb-at-math loser
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.080]   who's not going anywhere in life?
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.780]   Well, at least I'm not that burnout, right?
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.320]   Or is it like, how is anyone getting an A in this class?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.160]   I'm not getting an A.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.980]   What's happening?
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.580]   What can I learn from them?
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.580]   So the openness and willingness to self-improve,
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.740]   I think, is the underwriting mechanism.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.820]   And hardly anyone cites that study,
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.220]   but I think about it all the time.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.580]   And it's the kind of thing that I like,
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.420]   if I'm being honest,
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.020]   that's the mindset I want my kids to have
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.840]   as they go through life.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.720]   - Very interesting.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.660]   I'm gonna ask you more about this looking down
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.740]   or looking up in terms of performance.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.900]   But before I do that,
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.340]   I have questions about these brief 25-minute,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.660]   I think you said, interventions.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.560]   - Yeah, sometimes 25.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.580]   Sometimes we do two sessions, each about 20, 25, yeah.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.620]   - Can you give us a sense
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.540]   of what those interventions look like?
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.940]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.800]   These two sessions have positive effects
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.920]   lasting up to four years and perhaps even beyond.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.380]   Maybe just a top contour of some of what these kids hear
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.520]   during those sessions.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.100]   - Yeah, I mean, so the first thing to realize
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.100]   is that they're short and they have to do two things
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.340]   in order to have long-lasting effects.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.860]   One is I have to convince you to think differently
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.500]   at the end of the session.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.300]   So I just have to persuade you over the course of 25 minutes
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.740]   to have a different mindset.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.460]   That's sometimes hard.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.460]   But then even if I do that,
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.940]   you then might have months or years
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.340]   between when I did that and when the outcome is measured.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.540]   So how could you remember it and apply it?
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.260]   And how many 25-minute experiences in your life
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.980]   do you have no recollection of, right?
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.240]   I have lots.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.740]   So I think people are skeptical
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.460]   of the mindset style of interventions
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.940]   for two different, I think, legitimate reasons.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.700]   Like, I remember a very famous statistician
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.500]   came to my office at UT Austin and was like,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.300]   "I just don't understand these interventions.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.100]   "I mean, the other day I spent 25 minutes
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.580]   "telling my son all the things he has to change
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.260]   "and like, oh, he's doing everything wrong.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.300]   "And he didn't remember it five minutes later.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.980]   "How could someone remember your thing four years later?"
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.340]   And I was like, "Did you hear yourself talking?
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.220]   "Like, I'm sure the way you talked to your son
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.220]   "was like totally condescending and bad."
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.740]   So the first step is, in that 25 minutes,
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.140]   how are you communicating in a way
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.940]   where someone's ears are open,
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.620]   where they're not feeling talked down to,
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.520]   ashamed, humiliated, et cetera?
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.940]   But then the second step is saying that to you at a time
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.020]   when it's possible for there to be
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.580]   what we call a recursive process or a snowball effect
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.080]   that's gonna happen over time.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.380]   So that's the stage setting.
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.380]   Okay, so now let's take the first part.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.540]   25 minutes, what am I gonna say to you, right?
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.900]   There are three big things that are in every intervention.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.580]   And the term that Greg Walton,
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.420]   the Stanford professor, colleague, collaborator,
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.220]   uses is wise interventions.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.660]   That's the umbrella term of which growth mindset is one.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.260]   And a good one, but it's just one of many.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.500]   For wise interventions,
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.620]   we often do the following three things.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.540]   First is we present some new scientific information,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.300]   some idea that almost in like a Gladwell way
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.340]   is not obvious and intuitive to the reader,
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.000]   but feels like new information and useful information.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.440]   So the first is a scientific.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.180]   The second is we present participants with stories
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.200]   from people like them who've used those ideas
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.260]   in their lives and found them useful.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.880]   So in the concrete case of ninth graders
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.220]   getting growth mindset,
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.940]   it's like 10th, 11th, 12th graders
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.940]   who previously felt dumb,
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.220]   learned a growth mindset, then felt better.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.060]   It's more complicated than that.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.980]   That's the basic idea.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.780]   And last, we don't just tell them the stories,
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.780]   we ask third for participants to author a story.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.540]   So they write a narrative about a time when they struggled,
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.580]   a time when they doubted themselves,
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.140]   and then remembered this idea that people can change,
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.820]   like my brain can grow, et cetera.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.860]   So the three points are like scientific information,
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.800]   stories, or the technical term is descriptive norms.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.740]   So you're giving people information
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.700]   about what's normal for people like you.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.340]   And then the third is the writing,
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.040]   which we call saying is believing,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.980]   which is a term that's a popularized version
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.940]   of the term that came from classic social psychologists,
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.180]   Josh Aaronson, Elliot Aaronson,
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.860]   who found in the work on cognitive dissonance
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.780]   30, 40 years ago, that one of the best ways
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.700]   to change someone's mind about something
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.100]   is to ask them to try to persuade somebody else,
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.020]   so that we do those sort of things.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.260]   So what is the science in the growth mindset?
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.900]   That's where we draw on the metaphor
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.120]   that the brain is like a muscle,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.660]   that just like muscles get stronger
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.920]   when they're challenged and can recover,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.460]   so too does the brain get smarter
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.020]   when it's pushed and challenged in a certain way.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.600]   This idea that writing a story about oneself
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.860]   or about others in which one succeeds
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.900]   can be useful toward building growth mindset
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.820]   in basic terms, I think that's what you're referring to,
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.660]   I think is interesting.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.180]   It sort of suggests that we have brain circuits
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.140]   that underlie growth mindset type behaviors and thinking,
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.840]   and that just storing into those
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.220]   can potentially lead to better decision-making and behavior.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.600]   I mean, obviously it can't create new skills
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.400]   simply because I can't write a story
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.680]   about me being able to dunk a basketball
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.120]   and then expect that I can dunk a basketball
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.020]   because at present I can't,
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.440]   but the idea of writing a story
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.520]   about the effort going into dunking a basketball
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.720]   and learning how, and then translating that
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.140]   to a more realistic sense of ability
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.800]   that allows me to then go practice more,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.640]   is that sort of what you're referring to?
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   - Yeah, so in a 2016 paper in PNAS,
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.900]   Greg Walton and I explained these types of interventions
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.940]   as a, we call them a lay theory intervention.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.180]   And the idea there is that lay people,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.140]   like not scientific theories,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.080]   but just our intuitive theories for explaining the world
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.120]   help us anticipate what something means.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.240]   So the idea from basic developmental psychology
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.960]   is that human beings are walking around
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.160]   with kind of prior belief about objects,
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.520]   about motion, about number,
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.900]   and then later about complex social structures
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.280]   like whether people are looking down on me,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.600]   how, where I stand relative to others,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.240]   and also little lay theories about adversity.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.960]   What does it mean when I have to put in effort?
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.460]   What does it mean when I fail?
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.020]   So the idea is that if you understand the theory
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.280]   someone has, then you'll understand the meaning
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.240]   they'll make about a future experience.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.680]   And therefore, well, and the reason meaning matters
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.200]   is because the way you interpret something
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.000]   then affects how you respond to it, right?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.940]   So if I see someone and they're doing something innocuous,
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.720]   but I interpret it as a threat, do I call the police?
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.560]   You know, do I run away?
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.860]   That's my interpretation, that's causing it, right?
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.180]   And so there's a long way of saying,
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.480]   it turns out one of the best ways
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.180]   to preset someone's meaning and give them a different theory
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.800]   is to give them a different story.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.160]   Stories are kind of like theories in motion.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.560]   This is why, you know,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.280]   like what's the point of war and peace, right?
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.080]   War and peace is really a theory of great leaders
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.160]   in the war, and if there's any English PhDs,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.040]   I'm sure they'll tell me that's an oversimplified version
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.720]   of what Tolstoy was doing,
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.000]   but you learn the theory in a narrative way, right?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.860]   So this is the classic idea throughout human history.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.220]   Great writers and authors
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.500]   give us theories through narrative, right?
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.540]   And so we're just taking that simple human fact
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.020]   and doing it in a 10-minute activity.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.300]   And the lay theory in a person's mind
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.920]   that when things are difficult, it can change,
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.580]   can be taught with a very simple narrative,
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.300]   which is this person or even I experienced difficulty
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.440]   in something that mattered to me.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.980]   That difficulty didn't determine my entire future
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.900]   because actually there were steps that I could take
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.980]   in order to like make a difference.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.980]   Here are the steps that I took, and then it improved.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.420]   So it's a very, it's like the simplest Freytag's pyramid.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.160]   And even though that simple story
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.220]   is available to all of us,
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.300]   you could look in culture and see it,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.500]   you also see the opposite lay theory all the time.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.260]   And so without, absent our intervention,
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.340]   it's not like people couldn't end up with a growth mindset,
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.620]   but they wouldn't kind of know what to sort for
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.940]   or what to look for.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.540]   So we give them some touch points
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.380]   for a very simple of like frustration,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.180]   things can change, then they got better.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.820]   And we think that once people do that
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.040]   in our writing exercises,
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.580]   they're more likely to see that pattern out in the world.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.420]   And if you see that enough,
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.640]   and then you take the actual steps to get better,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.220]   then it starts becoming true for you.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.600]   And that's what I call the recursive process
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.620]   that you, we give people a starting hypothesis
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.900]   about the world.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.140]   They go out, try things, struggle, fail, it improves.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.780]   Then they see that that's true,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.700]   and then they can keep acting on that over time.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.620]   - I feel like so much of getting better at things
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   involves reappraising the stress or anxiety response.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:56.340]   You know, the friction that one feels
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.120]   when they can't perform something well,
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.980]   or when things feel overwhelming or confusing.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.700]   And I think the analogies to physical exercise apply,
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.740]   but I feel like they're limited
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.600]   in the sense that I like the idea
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.220]   that the brain is like a muscle,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.020]   that it can grow and get stronger.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.500]   I think the key difference to my mind
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.200]   is that, you know, like working out with weights,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.680]   you get some sense of the result you're going to get
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.820]   because there's like a lot of blood flow into the muscle.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.060]   So it's like a hint of what's possible.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.060]   - Right.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.400]   - With cardiovascular exercise,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.440]   like if we run hard up a hill,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.620]   there's that moment where your lungs are burning, et cetera.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.660]   And anyone who understands exercise
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.560]   knows that that's the signal for adaptation,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.360]   such that the next time you can do the same thing
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.780]   without the burning of the lungs.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.660]   - Right.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.940]   - When it comes to mental work and learning,
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.080]   I think we immediately assume
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.900]   that if we're not performing well,
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.660]   if we're getting confused or overwhelmed,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.140]   that somehow we're doing it wrong.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.160]   - Yeah.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.300]   - As opposed to stimulating the growth.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.140]   - Right.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.700]   - Are there any studies that point to
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.300]   bridging the relationship between the physiology,
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.320]   you know, the stress response and the mindset
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.260]   that allows one to say, okay, this is really hard
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.260]   and I keep failing and failing and failing,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.140]   at this math, at this language learning,
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.200]   at writing this essay, whatever it is.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.940]   And that's exactly what I'm supposed to be doing.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.060]   It's like the burning of the lungs
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.780]   or it's like the failure to complete
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.300]   another repetition in the gym.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.540]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that you're right.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.780]   You know, the standard growth mindset message
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.580]   does have reappraisal components,
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.160]   specifically around something
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.400]   Carol Dweck has called effort beliefs,
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.340]   which is very simply the belief that
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.620]   if it's hard, it means you're doing the wrong thing.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.700]   And that follows naturally from the fixed mindset idea
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.180]   that ability can't change.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.980]   And I think it's very important to point out
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.500]   the centrality of that effort belief
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.340]   because people have tried to apply growth mindset,
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.220]   but simplified it in a way of just saying
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.100]   basically try harder, right?
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.940]   Or I believe in you.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.820]   If you try hard enough, you can do anything, right?
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.060]   But if your natural inclination is to view
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.460]   the need for effort as a sign
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.460]   that you are doing the wrong thing,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.620]   which is that's the default interpretation,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.860]   then people are gonna quit, right?
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.860]   If you believe effort out to you as lacking potential,
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.420]   and then I say, you need to try hard,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.780]   I'm saying you don't have potential.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.620]   That basic insight is very poorly misunderstood
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.420]   in the field, and it's led to tons of misapplications
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.940]   of Carol's work.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.620]   And then people are like, well, this thing doesn't work.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.220]   Well, okay, but you haven't addressed the effort belief.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.500]   So I think that the first type of response
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.060]   to what you've said is you can't just abstractly
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.580]   tell someone your brain is a muscle
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.980]   and assume that magically,
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.420]   then in the midst of stress and frustration and confusion
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.740]   and all those negative experiences
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.820]   that you're gonna immediately say,
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.860]   yes, I love doing this and this is great.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.740]   But then there's also the physiological component,
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.740]   as you're saying.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.740]   So when we're stressed, frustrated, confused,
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.860]   your heart starts racing.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.820]   Maybe your palms get sweaty, right?
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.540]   You start, your breathing starts getting heavier.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.140]   My daughter is 13 before like a cello audition.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.620]   It's like, I have butterflies in my stomach.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.300]   I don't, what does this mean?
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.940]   And I think that growth mindset research
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.940]   didn't always deal with the visceral experience
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.420]   of stress and frustration.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.020]   And I think in a world in which someone
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.620]   hears the growth mindset message and says,
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.340]   "Yes, now I'm gonna go challenge myself.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.700]   "I'm gonna be, I'm gonna embrace stress and frustration,
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.060]   "do the mental equivalent of running ladders
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.020]   "or running up a hill."
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.340]   Then they feel that stress,
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.460]   but if they don't know how to interpret that,
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.780]   it's like growth mindset isn't gonna get them
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.500]   to the skill development, right?
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.940]   Or at least to the mental wellbeing
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.260]   of feeling like they have confidence and can do well.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.780]   So in some research that we've done in the last few years,
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.140]   what we've tried to do is to marry together
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.900]   the growth mindset idea with great work
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.380]   originally coming out of Ali Crum and Jeremy Jamison's labs
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.140]   who were building on lots of great appraisal psychologists,
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.020]   Wendy Mendez and others, to say,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.740]   "Okay, in the inevitable experience
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.700]   "where if you fully believe our growth mindset
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.980]   "and then now you load your plate with challenges,
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.140]   "but now you've got a physiological stress response,
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.140]   "how are you gonna appraise that better?"
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.940]   And that's kind of been the new frontier
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.660]   of growth mindset work in the last four or five years.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.580]   - Yeah, could you tell us more
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.260]   about this stress is enhancing mindset?
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.580]   I think it's a really interesting one,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.100]   especially when it's woven in with the growth mindset.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.620]   - Yeah, so let me tell you kind of that on its own
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.780]   and then the story of how we had this insight
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   is actually kind of interesting too.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.220]   But just the basic idea as people who've heard
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.260]   about Ali Crum would know and Jeremy Jamison
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.820]   is that an experience of your heart racing,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.060]   your palms sweating, anxiety in your stomach,
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.500]   that is itself a new stressor
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.140]   that then needs to be interpreted and appraised
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.180]   by the person experiencing it.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.940]   That idea on its own is kind of revolutionary for people.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   People tend to think that your physiological arousal
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.020]   is this objective experience that is universally bad.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.260]   Ali Crum calls that a stress is debilitating belief.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.300]   And I think that's a good label for it.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   It's this idea that heart racing, palms sweaty,
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.260]   butterflies in your stomach
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.100]   is a sign of your impending failure and doom
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.940]   and it will always interfere with your performance.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.580]   And the implication therefore is if you were about
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.420]   to do well on whatever you're gonna do,
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.020]   then you wouldn't feel that way.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:14.060]   Ali Crum calls this being stressed about being stressed.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.780]   And that, I think it's a really common experience right now
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.180]   where people are like, wow, if I was a confident,
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.740]   good person who was about to do well,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.700]   I wouldn't be sitting here feeling so stressed
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.060]   about how stressed I am.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.260]   And it becomes this metacognitive layered loop
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.580]   of just being stuck in your own mind
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.020]   and interpreting your arousal
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.060]   in the most negative possible light.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.580]   So that stress is debilitating belief doesn't,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.140]   people aren't like wrong for having come to that belief
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.420]   because it's everywhere in our culture.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.860]   One thing I do in my class a lot
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.980]   is I just have people Google image search
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.380]   stress management means.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.020]   And first of all, a surprising number about cats.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.340]   I don't know why people think cat pictures
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.500]   are like the way to convey complex scientific ideas.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.180]   Like it would be like a cat with like a cookie jar
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.340]   and it'll be like growth mindset.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.540]   I don't understand what that, what the point of that is.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.780]   But you know, page two or three after all the cats,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.580]   then you get to a lot of things that are,
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.260]   you'll see a person with a battery that's empty
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.300]   and it's like, they didn't de-stress
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.820]   or 10 tips for de-stressing.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.460]   And it'll be like, go on a walk, drink chamomile tea.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.700]   Like, and the underlying implication
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700]   is that if you're stressed,
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.220]   then you need to distract yourself.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.180]   You need to get rid of that stress.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.580]   But alternative explanation in the growth mindset world
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.980]   is well, maybe you have something that's very important
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.220]   to you and you've pushed yourself to embrace some challenge
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.380]   in a really admirable way.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.420]   And that has filled your plate in some way.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.260]   Like if I was about to give a presentation
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.660]   to a senior vice president at work
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.180]   and I'm stressed about it,
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.740]   I should not like go take a bubble bath
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.180]   and like go for a walk.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.300]   Like I should get ready to kick ass at the presentation.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.580]   And so I think what Ali Crum and others have identified
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.260]   is that you can think differently about that stress.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.020]   You can say, this is actually a sign
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.980]   that I'm preparing to optimize my performance.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.340]   And maybe the heart racing isn't my body
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.180]   being afraid of damage.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.100]   Maybe it's my body getting more oxygenated blood
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.420]   to my brain and my muscles to like help me do really well.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.660]   And that's called a stress can be enhancing belief.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:34.380]   And what's so interesting I think about this work
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.220]   and I wanna give credit to lots of other people
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.900]   is that if you're in the stress is debilitating mindset,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.700]   you don't realize that there's an alternative.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.900]   You just think that that's the way it is.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.700]   So it never occurs to you to say,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.140]   oh, this stress is helping me, right?
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.260]   But once you tell people this,
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:55.180]   what happens is in our studies,
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.260]   we actually see a change in stress physiology.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.300]   Changing your mindset about stress in turn
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.540]   changes how your body reacts,
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.340]   which then becomes a different stressor
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.500]   that you can interpret.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:11.260]   And so the big insight was pairing these ideas
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:16.020]   about reframing stress as an inevitable force
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.220]   that's gonna destroy your goal pursuit
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.540]   into a resource to be cultivated
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.260]   and pairing that together with the first step,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.300]   which was the growth mindset that causes you to like
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.140]   be open to the challenge in the first place.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.300]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.820]   and acknowledge our sponsor AG1.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.780]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.460]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.140]   every day since 2012.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.580]   And indeed that's true.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.860]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.500]   once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.420]   and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.060]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.980]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.300]   Those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.940]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.860]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.900]   it's often hard to do so,
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.780]   especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.020]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.340]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.940]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.500]   just report feeling better.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.780]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.060]   because it supports gut health
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.700]   and of course gut health supports immune system health
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.700]   and brain health.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.820]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.300]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.060]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.620]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.780]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.140]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.440]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.660]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.660]   and physical health.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.940]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.320]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.760]   to claim a special offer.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.140]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.820]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.060]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.140]   I feel like so much of what human beings struggle with
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.360]   such as learning and performance,
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.220]   our relationship to stress, et cetera,
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.500]   could be resolved if we could overcome
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.820]   the deficit in language.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.380]   Here's what I'm thinking.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.300]   We're talking about reframing stress
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.920]   to make it performance-enhancing
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.880]   as opposed to performance-diminishing.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.120]   I wonder if we replace the word stress
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.720]   with just like levels of arousal.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.840]   But then people hear arousal
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.500]   and they think certain kinds of arousal.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.080]   So what we want to do is,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.360]   the way I think about it is like a continuum of readiness.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.400]   But then that doesn't work
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.320]   because readiness can be readiness for sleep,
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.680]   which is a low level of arousal.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.560]   You don't want to be highly alert,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.440]   then you're not ready for sleep, right?
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.720]   So there's a real deficit of language
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.120]   where I think if there was some other word,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.260]   I can't come up with it on the fly,
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.220]   where one's internal level of readiness
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.240]   as opposed to stress,
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.500]   and maybe it looks a lot like autonomic arousal
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.980]   where heart rate is increased
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.020]   and blood pressure is increased,
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.860]   and people would say, "Oh yeah,
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.780]   that's my body being ready for something
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.380]   as opposed to stressed about doing it."
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.380]   And it's kind of a trivial recasting of stress
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.660]   on the one hand,
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.180]   but in terms of kids learning about life
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.140]   and stress and arousal and these internal signals
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.600]   and adults learning about those
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.060]   and incorporating those into their life goals,
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.700]   I think it would be pretty meaningful.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.800]   And again, I don't have a solution to this,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.740]   but I feel like everyone here, stress is bad.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.380]   You hear stress is enhancing, okay, great.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.080]   But I think it's really about developing a language
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.140]   that lets us interpret what's going on in our bodies
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.820]   and compare that to what we are facing in the moment
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.460]   and just decide is this well-matched
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.920]   or poorly matched to what we need to do?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.540]   Is it great for going to sleep?
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.420]   Is it great for learning?
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.420]   Is it great for catching that train
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.700]   that's soon to leave the station?
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.500]   And I just wonder why the deficit in language?
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.700]   - Yeah, I think that's a profound question
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.380]   because small changes in language
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.140]   perpetuate problematically theories
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.500]   because they have the baggage on them.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.900]   And I think that, let's think this through.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.300]   So what the psychophysiologists like to point out
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.500]   is that there's a distinction between the stressor,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.980]   which is the, let's call it the internally
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.300]   or externally imposed demand.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.500]   It could be something that's thwarting your goals or--
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.300]   - The exam, the difficult conversation,
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   for some people going to the doctor or the dentist.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.100]   - The hard conversation with somebody you care about.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.940]   It could be, or a physical stressor, right?
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.020]   Like a football game or running a marathon, right?
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.460]   So anything that imposes demands on your body and mind
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.580]   and therefore will require resources,
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.340]   whether like metabolic resources to do well,
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.620]   that's a stressor, okay?
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.700]   Then there's your appraisal of it.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.700]   That's what you name it, how you interpret it,
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.260]   how you frame it in your mind.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.820]   And then there's your response.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.220]   People in general conflate the stressor
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.140]   with a stress response.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.460]   When they say stress,
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.940]   they're like, "I'm really stressed right now."
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.660]   Well, really what you mean is that there were stressors,
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.060]   you appraised them as more than you can handle,
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.860]   and then you had a threat type stress response,
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.540]   which means that your body
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.340]   is preparing for damage and defeat.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.220]   And that is like an inheritance
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.580]   of how the sympathetic nervous system evolved,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.980]   which was to keep us alive from threats,
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.900]   mainly physical threats.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.820]   And so if you have a stressor,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.540]   some demand, praise is something you cannot handle.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.180]   And then your threat type response,
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.380]   your body's basically assuming you're gonna lose
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.020]   whatever physical fight you're in,
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.780]   like the bear is gonna tear you apart.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.420]   And then your main goal at that point is to stay alive
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.860]   and like bleed out more slowly, right?
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.180]   So you end up with more blood kept centrally
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.380]   in the body cavity, less in the extremities, right?
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.580]   The body releases cortisol
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.180]   because it's an anti-inflammatory.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.220]   It's gonna like help with tissue repair
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.860]   45 minutes down the road.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.060]   So there's a whole like cascade of physiological responses
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.260]   that come in part from the mental appraisal
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.740]   that this stressor is more than you can handle.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:22.860]   Now, we're very rarely confronted
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.700]   with those kinds of physical stressors these days.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.660]   It's often social stressors,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.500]   but a lot of these social stressors
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.740]   are the threat of social death, right?
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.660]   Like a ninth grader coming into high school,
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.980]   getting bullied by all their friends
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.660]   or excluded because their friends in eighth grade
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.900]   now treat you like you don't exist, right?
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.580]   The threat of social death is pretty bad, right?
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.500]   Or you're a new legal associate
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.140]   and you've filed your first brief
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.260]   and all the partners are like, this is garbage.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.660]   We're not gonna send it to the client, right?
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.220]   Like all of a sudden you're on trial socially
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.220]   in front of these people who could cut you loose at any time.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.020]   That's a very vibrant social stressor
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.020]   that evokes the same kind of physiological response
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.340]   as we suppose a physical one would, right?
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.220]   And so we're very careful to distinguish in our studies
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.980]   a stressor from the stress response
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:15.100]   because often the stressor isn't really a bad thing.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.260]   Like getting critical feedback on your first legal brief
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.940]   as a junior associate, well, that could be awesome.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.940]   It could be like, oh, great.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.260]   I have these awesome partners at my great law firm
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.580]   are now giving me personalized feedback.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.780]   That's useful.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.140]   Or I'm a ninth grader and I have to make new friends,
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.660]   but I don't know, maybe you need new friends.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.780]   Like that could be a good thing, right?
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.300]   And same with a test, same with a presentation
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.340]   to senior vice president, whatever it is.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.700]   Stressors often in our daily lives are not good or bad.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.180]   Now, of course, there's traumatic stressors
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.060]   that are really bad for people.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.740]   But then the appraisal is really
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.980]   where there's a lot of leverage.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.220]   And if you think that the stressor is inevitably bad
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.260]   and that your response to it is always harmful,
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.820]   then it's really hard for you to think
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.060]   that you have the resources to meet the demand
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.660]   that you're facing.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.300]   And you end up in this threat cycle.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.820]   So in a lot of our research, what we try to do
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.500]   is give people a different story to tell themselves
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.740]   about a stressor and about their response.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.180]   So that way they end up in a better place.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.780]   And I don't know what that better language is,
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.780]   but I will say, I once gave a talk at a middle school
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.300]   and a high school.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.940]   And I used slides that Jeremy Jameson, who's
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.460]   my collaborator, had sent me that had the word "arousal"
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.380]   on it on every single slide.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.100]   And that was a big mistake in a room of middle school kids.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.900]   I'd strongly recommend different terminology.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.380]   And I was a middle school teacher.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.940]   I should have known that you can't say
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.100]   that word in a high school.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.620]   Right, yeah, I think that there needs to be a better language.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.700]   I think if people of all ages understood
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.100]   the autonomic nervous system,
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.620]   this aspect of our nervous system that is on a continuum
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.260]   that leads us to either be, I guess, at the extremes,
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.540]   you would say coma would be the deepest state
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.740]   of parasympathetic- - Right, total non-arousal.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.020]   - Yeah, non-arousal.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.540]   Then ascending from very deeply asleep, lightly asleep,
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.540]   groggy, awake, awake and alert, awake and alert
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.020]   to the point of being highly alert.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.420]   And then you get into kind of low-level panic
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.220]   and then all out panic attack, right?
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.500]   I mean, that's kind of the continuum,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.260]   the autonomic continuum.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.660]   I feel like if people understood that
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.700]   and they could simply ask,
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.540]   okay, where's my body and mind along that continuum,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.860]   and then compare it to whatever it is they face,
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.480]   then we'd have a better sense of whether or not
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.100]   we were in the correct, maybe even optimal state
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.340]   for dealing with challenge or not.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.780]   And along those lines, what is the optimal internal state
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.900]   for dealing with challenge
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.420]   that is just outside our ability?
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.900]   You know, maybe in an exam where I can naturally
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.500]   get 85% of the answers correct, but maybe 15%.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.740]   I think this is what the machine learning and AI tells us
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.660]   is probably the appropriate level of difficulty
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.460]   for something in order to best learn.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.620]   I know that's probably too broad.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.140]   - Yeah, it depends on if you're motivated
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.940]   and if, you know, a lot of things, but yeah.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.060]   I mean, I think if you think of the autonomic arousal
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.740]   on just one axis,
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:33.840]   where you start running into problems, we find,
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.700]   is that I think you're right that there's like, you know,
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:41.020]   coma to like some arousal or meaningful arousal,
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.140]   but it's the middle to the end part
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.940]   where there's two different tracks.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.660]   And one track is very high arousal,
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.220]   but you're terrified of the damage and defeat
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.380]   and the humiliation and the failure.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.980]   And so that's demanding all your attention.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.580]   That's what we call a threat type stress.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.620]   There's another version that is, again, very high arousal,
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.860]   but that's like you're stoked and you feel confident
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.060]   you're gonna do well.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.420]   And that's also very high arousal.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.300]   And if you just look at arousal measures
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.460]   like pre-ejection period, right?
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.720]   - Could you explain pre-ejection period?
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.300]   - It's just a, it's a simple measure
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.980]   of just the sympathetic nervous system
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.460]   that we use in all of our studies.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.260]   - So sympathetic, just to remind folks,
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.820]   is one aspect of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.260]   has nothing to do with sympathy,
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.160]   just the more alert means more contribution
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.460]   of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.740]   Sorry, it's a mouthful.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.060]   And then less alert would be more contribution
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.780]   of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.940]   - And PEP is just a measure that we use
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.180]   in our laboratory studies.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.540]   And another could have been like skin conductance,
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.660]   which is about the sweat coming out of your skin.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.700]   And then we use an electrode to figure out how much is there
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.900]   that those kinds of measures can't distinguish
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.220]   what we call a challenge type state.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.620]   That's almost like people have heard of flow
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.780]   where you're optimally balanced
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.340]   between important challenge you care about
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.860]   and resources and ability to, you know,
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.580]   overcome or at least deal with that challenge
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.340]   on the positive side.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.980]   And the other high arousal state, which is threat.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.780]   And that's, again, everything's highly engaged,
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.680]   your whole stress system,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.340]   but you don't think you can deal with it.
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.260]   So that becomes really important
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.940]   because here's a very practical example.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.860]   If you look at devices people are wearing
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.780]   to detect their stress,
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.220]   that might say high or low arousal,
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.220]   but it can't distinguish
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.420]   between super good positive challenge type stress
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.740]   and really negative threat type stress.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.380]   One of the examples that psychophysiologists
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.220]   like to say a lot,
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.900]   I got this from Jeremy Jameson,
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.060]   is imagine you're at the top of a double black diamond
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.980]   about to ski down.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:05.380]   If you are a good skier,
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.500]   your heart rate isn't probably low.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.180]   You're probably amped up.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.020]   You're stoked.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.840]   You're like, this is awesome.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.680]   I can't wait to do this.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.660]   If you're fully confident,
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.100]   you're gonna make all the turns and have a blast.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.420]   If you're a terrible skier,
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   you're just imagining the yard sale that's about to happen.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.340]   You're about to crash.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.460]   You're gonna fall down the mountain.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.600]   You might die.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.820]   Also high arousal.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.680]   If you're wearing like the regular watch
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.780]   that will just detect sympathetic nervous system activation,
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.300]   it wouldn't be able to tell the difference
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.020]   between really stoked to do something positive
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.980]   and terrified of like crashing and dying.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.020]   And so I like that example
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.780]   because often in social situations
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.700]   or performance situations,
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.900]   you wanna be high arousal to perform your best,
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.700]   but you want your perception of that demand,
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.100]   the demand that's requiring your body to respond
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.140]   to be matched with an equal belief
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.440]   or what we call appraisal of your resources
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   to meet that demand.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.500]   So I think my answer to the question is,
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.560]   well, I think it's not so much about
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.880]   what's the optimal amount of demand, right?
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   So that the 85% likelihood of success rate problems,
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.060]   that's titrating demand.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:19.060]   I think it's how do you pair a necessary level of demand
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.420]   for whatever goal you have
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.820]   with the perceptions of the resources.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.040]   And sometimes those resources are your internal,
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.940]   like just confidence,
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.820]   or sometimes it's your ability to reappraise
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.620]   and other times it's material resources.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.660]   Like do you have a, it could be in real life,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.060]   do you have a friend that you could turn to?
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.680]   Or it might be, have you been trained in a way
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.380]   where you're able to overcome this?
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.700]   Do you have enough time?
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.940]   So resources can be a big bucket.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.060]   And that's kind of the magic is
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.220]   because resources are appraised by the mind
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.100]   in our interventions,
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.460]   we can give you a different way of viewing your resources
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.180]   so that way people feel like they can meet the demand.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.580]   And that pushes them from a threat type response
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.220]   into a more challenge type response.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.140]   - It makes sense if I think that the stress,
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.220]   for lack of a better term,
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.020]   and the effort is going to get me where I need to go,
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.260]   eventually I'm going to be far more willing
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.700]   to invest the effort.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.820]   Especially if I'm motivated,
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.620]   I want the thing that lies at the finish line.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.220]   - You basically take the demand,
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.020]   which was your intense stress and worry,
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.820]   and turn it into a resource in your own mind.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.120]   And it turns out that that actually helps people cope
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.700]   at a physiological level.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.180]   - Got it, got it.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   - So, we've been talking a lot about kind of the nuts
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.740]   and bolts of growth mindset
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.060]   and stress is performance enhancing mindset.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:50.340]   Maybe we could shift a little bit to the discussion
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.700]   about what you call the mentor mindset.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.700]   And as we do that,
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.380]   maybe we'll weave back in some of these concepts.
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   Your book, "10 to 25" focuses heavily on social appraisal,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.700]   self appraisal.
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.540]   Basically the idea that we want to be liked
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.660]   and we don't want to be disliked,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.280]   and it hurts when people say mean things about us,
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.540]   or when we hear negative feedback,
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.620]   especially if it's provided publicly.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.260]   But ultimately what we do with that information
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.260]   is what determines whether or not we grow and move forward.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.060]   Everyone loves a great report card.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.740]   Nobody likes a poor report card.
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.740]   So, tell us about mentor mindset,
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.740]   and both for folks in the 10 to 25 age range,
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.540]   but also for everybody,
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.100]   because it's clear that this impacts us
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.260]   throughout our lifespan.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.180]   - Yeah, so the work I write about
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.500]   comes out of a dissertation led by Jeff Cohen
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.340]   at Stanford in the '90s with Claude Steele.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.980]   And they coined a term that they called
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.900]   the mentor's dilemma.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.980]   And the mentor's dilemma is the idea
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.780]   that if you're a leader, a manager, a coach, teacher,
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.460]   whatever it is, parent,
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.580]   it's very hard to simultaneously criticize somebody's work
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.060]   and motivate them to overcome and embrace that criticism.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.660]   And the reason it's a dilemma is because
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.340]   the leader on the one hand
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.800]   wants to maintain high standards by being critical,
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.260]   maybe in order to help the person grow,
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.080]   but that could crush the person's motivation.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.900]   The alternative is withhold your criticism.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.980]   Don't say the truth.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.060]   Hide all the critical feedback
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.700]   and be nice and super supportive.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:37.520]   But, and that meets your goal of being friendly and caring,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.700]   but it doesn't help the person grow.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.700]   So it feels like we have to walk through the world
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.260]   we're stuck between two bad choices.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.300]   Either you're a demanding autocratic dictator
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.740]   who doesn't care about human feelings,
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.620]   or you are a low standards wimp pushover
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.900]   that's giving in to the wimpy demands
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.580]   of the weak next generation.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.500]   And neither of those have uniformly positive connotations.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.820]   And the classic example in Jeff's work
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.100]   was a student at Stanford
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.140]   who writes the first draft of an essay
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.740]   and then gets really harsh critical feedback
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.500]   from a professor.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.760]   Are they willing to revise their work?
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.020]   Or do they say, this teacher hates me, they're biased,
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:29.020]   I dislike them, and leave the comments unaddressed.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.740]   So the solution to that in that research
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.180]   on the mentor's dilemma has been to say two things.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.520]   One is appeal to the very high standard you have
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.480]   for someone's work,
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.420]   but also always accompany that appeal to the high standard
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.880]   with an assurance that if they implement the feedback
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.980]   and use the support,
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.260]   that they're capable of meeting the high standard.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.900]   I like to think of it as,
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.020]   like if you go to the rollercoaster
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.260]   and they say you have to be this tall to ride, right?
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.740]   So just saying you have to be this tall
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.100]   and you're not, see you later,
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.800]   isn't reassuring to somebody, right?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.620]   But if you can say, here's the standard
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.180]   and I believe you can meet it, but it's gonna be hard,
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.740]   that means a lot.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.500]   It means I'm taking you seriously.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.420]   It means I believe in your growth.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.220]   And it's a kind of leadership practice
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.460]   that makes growth mindset be something that comes to life
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.840]   and feel true.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.460]   It's not just an idea in your head that you're growing.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.100]   It's like, I live in a social world
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.980]   where people are gonna push me to grow
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.680]   and not leave me alone.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.120]   - Are you familiar with the book of the late,
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.340]   I think the pronunciation is Randy Pausch
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.700]   for the last lecture?
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.540]   - No.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:42.380]   - He was a computer scientist.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.300]   He developed a lot of early online portals for kids,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.380]   in particular, young women to learn programming.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.780]   I think it was called Alice.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:57.660]   And he is known for what's called the last lecture.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.740]   He was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:59.680]   He eventually passed away,
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.140]   but he talked about in his book,
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.100]   lessons that were important for life.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.640]   And one of the things that he said was,
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.580]   the thing to worry about is not when your mentors
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.080]   and coaches are pushing you,
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.500]   it's when they stop pushing you,
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.420]   that you should really worry
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.820]   because that means they've basically given up on you.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.260]   So that always rung in my mind.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.660]   - Yeah, what I call the person
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.620]   who just is no longer maintaining high standards for you,
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.020]   I call that a protector mindset.
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.460]   That it's almost like it's gonna be too much trouble
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.260]   to see you dealing with stress from being pushed
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.000]   that I am gonna protect you from that stress.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.020]   Maybe I care about you,
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.260]   but I'm not gonna hold you to a high standard.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.340]   And I see that a lot in coaches.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.140]   I see it in teachers, I see it in parents.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.420]   For me, the opposite problematic version
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.640]   is what I call an enforcer mindset.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.340]   This is like, here's the standard,
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.340]   and I'm gonna hold you to it,
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.180]   and it's up to you to meet it or not.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.940]   That's kind of like the college professor
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.620]   that says, look to your left, look to your right,
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.320]   half of you are gonna be gone by the end of this.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:13.540]   For me, the solution is to think about
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.700]   taking the best parts of both of those two.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.380]   What's the high standards, high support?
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.580]   So enforcer, great, you've got the standards,
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.180]   let's add your support.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.060]   Protector, you care a lot, great, let's add the standards.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.020]   And what Jeff Cohen and Claude Steele found
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.780]   in their initial study is that students
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.680]   were far more likely to view negative criticism
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.140]   as a sign that the teacher cared for them
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.620]   if it was accompanied by a transparent
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.060]   and clear communication of these two elements
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.140]   of high standards and high support.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.780]   If it was just the critical feedback,
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.760]   the professor could have meant the same positive thing,
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.600]   I'm caring about you,
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.060]   but if they didn't make it clear to the person,
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.580]   then participants were less likely to think
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.780]   that the professor was on their side.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.820]   And in our work, in some small studies,
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.360]   we showed that even seventh graders,
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.480]   when they get critical feedback on their essays,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   are about twice as likely to implement
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.880]   the teacher's critical feedback
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.780]   with even a very short invocation
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.940]   of the high standards and the high support.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.540]   So to get to your question about mentor mindset,
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:25.420]   at some point, I got worried that our experiment
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.300]   on high standards, high support messages,
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.740]   which we called wise feedback in those studies,
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:35.260]   would be viewed as, I don't know, like a magic phrase.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.700]   Like my joke, my laugh line, this is a lame laugh line,
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.940]   but I'm a professor, so that's the best I can do.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.800]   My laugh line was always, I just live in fear
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.460]   that Pearson and other textbook companies
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.400]   are gonna sell wise feedback posted notes
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.100]   and say they can magically erase the achievement gap.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.400]   And I always said that as a joke,
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.320]   and then two things happened.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.280]   One is a popular author, a guy named Dan Coyle,
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.640]   literally called it magic feedback in his book,
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.240]   didn't cite us, but like--
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.600]   - You didn't cite us? - No.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.440]   - Dan.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.480]   - But also like magic feedback--
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.440]   - I'll say it so you don't have to, not cool.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.600]   Attribution is important.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:10.080]   - It's just not, it's not magic at all.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.880]   The magic of high standards and high support
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   is not the 18 words, it's I'm taking you seriously
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.720]   when a moment when you're vulnerable
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.020]   and I have power over you.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:26.740]   That is just so deeply human and so powerful.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.680]   But there's nothing about the magic words.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:33.420]   It's the experience of dignity and respect
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.020]   when you are questioning whether you're either worthy of it
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.640]   or are going to be given it by authorities.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.760]   - It's interesting, we had Dr. Becky Kennedy on here
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.520]   to talk about parenting and she said many important things,
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.500]   but among them was the fact that children,
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.680]   perhaps all people, want to feel real
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.240]   and they want to feel safe.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.280]   An important concept that I think many people heard
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.120]   and are really internalizing.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.760]   I know I am for sure.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.360]   And this idea of feeling real has to do with
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.240]   not just feeling seen, but that people believe us,
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.840]   even if they disagree with us, like they believe us.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.720]   - She has another thing that's super profound
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.640]   is the kind of two things argument,
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.960]   that I can both have high expectations for my kids
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.540]   and love my kids.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.480]   And I think that's a very good version
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.040]   of wise feedback mentor mindset.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.160]   That as parents, it either feels like
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.600]   I can expect a lot of my kids,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.000]   but then I'm a monster and they're gonna yell at me
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.720]   or I'm gonna be a pushover
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.360]   and then they're gonna be unruly.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:45.700]   And I think part of her wisdom is to help explain to parents
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.280]   how you can do both of those things.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.660]   - And indeed one can, right?
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.040]   I think, but it requires having a kind of dynamic stance
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.880]   or dynamic mindset as the teacher, the leader, the coach,
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.360]   the parent.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.600]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.460]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Waking Up.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.960]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.040]   that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.080]   mindfulness trainings, yoga needer sessions, and more.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.400]   I started meditating over three decades ago.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.240]   And what I found in the ensuing years
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.320]   is that sometimes it was very easy for me
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.040]   to do my daily meditation practice.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.680]   I was just really diligent.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.440]   But then as things would get more stressful,
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.480]   which of course is exactly
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.460]   when I should have been meditating more,
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.640]   my meditation practice would fall off.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.200]   With Waking Up, they make it very easy to find
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.640]   and consistently use a given meditation practice.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.440]   It has very convenient reminders
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.260]   and they come in different durations.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.700]   So even if you just have one minute
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.040]   or five minutes to meditate,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.440]   you can still get your meditation in,
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.300]   which research shows is still highly beneficial.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.100]   In addition to the many different meditations
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.400]   on the Waking Up app,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.280]   they also have yoga nidra sessions,
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.520]   which are a form of non-sleep deep rest
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.200]   that I personally find is extremely valuable
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.160]   for restoring mental and physical vigor.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.300]   I tend to do a yoga nidra lasting anywhere
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.680]   from 10 to 20 minutes, at least once a day.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.800]   And if I ever wake up in the middle of the night
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.200]   and I need to fall back asleep,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.960]   I also find yoga nidra to be extremely useful.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.900]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.900]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.740]   to try a free 30-day trial.
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.580]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.340]   I want to get back to some of the mechanics
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.700]   of how to go about that.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.040]   But why do you think this stuff is so hard?
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.700]   Like if we think about, I don't know,
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.380]   kind of a curbside evolutionary theory,
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.580]   meaning I don't have any formal training
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.780]   in evolutionary psychology.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.820]   You could step back and say, like, I don't know,
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.800]   maybe we just used to be so busy from morning to sleep
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.500]   that we didn't really have time to do anything
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.580]   except the stuff we needed to complete
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.900]   in order to feed our families
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.180]   and take care of our communities, et cetera.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.980]   And now a number of things are outsourced.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.700]   And so here we have this notion of strivings.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:56.540]   But then again, we went from hunter-gatherer cultures
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.200]   to writing "War and Peace" and everything else,
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.740]   technologies of all kinds.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.220]   So, you know, there must be something in the human brain
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.540]   that causes us to strive.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.780]   And what we're really talking about here is striving
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.540]   and our relationship with striving.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.900]   So if we were to step back and just say,
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.380]   okay, what do you think determines
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.220]   whether or not someone feels they can do better?
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.660]   Is it early success?
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.120]   You know, they tried at something.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.340]   I mean, everyone, most everyone, I assume,
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:32.540]   who tries to learn to walk walks, learns to speak speaks.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.720]   You know, they're rare exceptions.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:37.940]   But, you know, what do you think this whole thing
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.760]   about strivings is about?
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.300]   And when we talk about growth mindset,
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.860]   stress enhancing mindset, the mentor mindset,
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:50.580]   I mean, are we trying to get back to activating systems
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.620]   that are hardwired within us
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.820]   and that have been kind of masked by daily life?
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.660]   Or are we trying to kind of better ourselves
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.060]   and our species through, you know,
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.380]   like really trying to do something
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.800]   that's never been done in human history before?
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.180]   - Right.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.020]   - It's a big question.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:08.840]   - It's a big question.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.860]   But I mean, I think that all I can do is conjecture,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.700]   you know, as a scientist.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:16.060]   But I'm often reminded of something I heard from Ron Dahl,
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.940]   who's a neuroscientist at Berkeley.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:19.260]   - Not Ronald Dahl, the children's book author.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.540]   - Not Rald Dahl, Ron Dahl.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:25.380]   Although Ron is just so, he's an awesome guy.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.740]   It's like polymath, he can do everything.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.440]   And just so curious and generous.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.820]   What he always says to me, he's like,
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.140]   "Look," he's like, "David, what do you think
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.500]   the human brain wants to do?"
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.140]   Like, "I don't know, feel good."
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.940]   He's like, "No, it wants to feel better."
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.940]   And I think what he was trying to get me to see
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.880]   is that it's the kind of pursuit of some kind of delta.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.200]   - A change.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.620]   - Yeah, a change from the state.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:55.220]   And I think the argument is that even if you are,
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.560]   if what you thought was your biggest need,
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.420]   if that was satisfied, then there's always another thing,
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.020]   I think is part of the argument.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:08.140]   But it's also this idea that if you think of the human brain
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.620]   as trying to learn at all times,
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.780]   like, what is it trying to learn?
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.100]   And at least in the animal studies, as you know,
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.540]   often it's like, how do I either feel better
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.780]   or avoid feeling worse in a lot of ways?
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.860]   And I think that, as I think about adolescence,
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.920]   that's a period where your theory of how to feel better
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.040]   is dramatically changing
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.680]   because you're no longer fully cared for by adults, right?
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.500]   All of a sudden, your criteria
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:40.360]   for feeling good about yourself is your social standing,
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.760]   not just in your parents' eyes,
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.240]   but in the eyes of the community
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.440]   and the milieu you're a part of.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.880]   And that comes a lot from your contribution value.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.120]   If you think in our evolutionary history,
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.940]   like, being ostracized and alone is certain death
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.800]   in ancient human cultures, right?
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.200]   I mean, you can't, the tribe's wandering around
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.280]   in the savanna, you're alone.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.880]   At a minimum, you have no one to watch out for you
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.120]   when you fall asleep.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.880]   And so, and humans can't sleep in trees
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.520]   'cause our muscles don't contract
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.160]   when we're asleep, unlike animals.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.380]   And so you're just exposed on the ground.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.120]   If you're alone, eventually you're gonna die, right?
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.360]   So the fear of moving from parents
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   taking care of your safety all night
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:25.380]   to now you have to trust peers to take care of you
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.580]   and watch over you, that comes to the forefront
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.980]   of young people's minds,
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.380]   the kind of the minute puberty strikes.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.140]   And so what it means to feel better often
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.820]   is that I'm socially valued by the group.
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.180]   There's something, they're gonna keep me around
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.580]   for some reason.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.480]   Now, they don't often keep score in an explicit way.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.980]   I mean, now things are in social media,
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.700]   maybe they're kind of keeping score,
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.340]   but like the rules of how you're doing socially
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:51.380]   are so implicit, you have to read between the lines,
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.460]   they're inferred.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.700]   Social hierarchy is very complex for adolescents.
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:01.460]   And so they overdo it thinking through,
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.420]   like, how am I standing?
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.700]   Like, where am I relative to others?
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.280]   Now, that process is started by puberty.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.860]   And we know from lots of species work
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.440]   that it then leads to changes in the brain.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.340]   So the dopaminergic system, of course,
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.520]   it's like driven in part by changes
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.860]   in going out on maturation.
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.780]   Ron likes to talk about these great studies of songbirds,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.200]   of how do they learn the mating calls.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.380]   And if songbirds don't have testosterone
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.300]   when they are learning the mating calls,
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.700]   they don't do the like over the top obsessive practice,
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.180]   so they don't master them.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.100]   And then they don't mate and they die alone.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.660]   - Interesting, yeah, I'm familiar with that literature.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:46.540]   There's a great, unfortunately now passed away biologist
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.240]   who was first in the UK and then was up at UC Davis,
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.580]   Peter Marler, who studied the bird song learning.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.220]   And it's- - It's amazing work.
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.300]   - Yeah, it's amazing work.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.580]   And it mimics a lot of the development of human speech,
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.320]   although not exactly, like there's this babbling phase
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.940]   where babies and birds experiment with different tones
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.980]   and they're learning to use the pharynx and larynx
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   or in birds, it's a slightly different system.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.680]   And some birds are seasonal singers,
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.900]   but I wasn't familiar with this result
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.860]   that the testosterone drives a kind of obsessive practice.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.020]   - Yeah, it's an obsessive practice
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.700]   in order to demonstrate status, but really your value.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.620]   I mean, there it's mate value, right?
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.100]   But I think the same thing is true for lots of things
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.220]   that teenagers try, it could be playing guitar,
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.820]   you know, could be gymnastics.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.020]   I mean, think about how many of their Olympic athletes
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.460]   are like 14, right?
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.860]   And they're waking up at four in the morning,
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.780]   they're practicing obsessively.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.900]   How many like pro-social hackers
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.100]   who take down evil foreign governments, right,
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.780]   are teenagers, right?
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.100]   They're things that take so much practice
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.180]   and so much learning happen at the exact same age
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.300]   as adults are saying these kids are lazy
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.220]   and don't wanna work, right?
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.620]   So I tend to focus on,
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.580]   let's get to your question about
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.740]   why do people strive to get better?
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.500]   I think in adolescence,
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.740]   you look around in your social milieu
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.540]   and see what counts for status,
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.100]   not in a superficial way, it sometimes happens,
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.180]   but often in a deeply meaningful way.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.900]   What am I gonna bring to the table?
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.820]   - One would hope.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.660]   - And then, well--
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.060]   - I remember junior high school being far more superficial,
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.500]   but I'm 48, so I remember it in kind of the
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.980]   John Hughes film era where people were very divided
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.700]   in terms of jocks and skateboarders and rockers and nerds.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.660]   Now, it seems a little bit more mishmashed.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.340]   But I think also people will, in adolescence,
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.420]   I feel like kids find their niche
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.820]   and then try and excel within that niche.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.660]   - Yeah.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.740]   - You know, as opposed to high school
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.540]   or junior high school being one huge hierarchy.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.380]   - Yeah.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.580]   - You know, there's kind of these sub-hierarchies.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.620]   - Yeah, Dan McFarland is a sociologist at Stanford,
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.340]   did this really interesting study with the ad health data.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.220]   And it turns out you could characterize
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.060]   the social hierarchies in different high schools
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.460]   by kind of single pyramid high schools
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.020]   versus multi-pyramid high schools.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.380]   And there's way better adjustment
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.100]   in the multi-pyramid high schools,
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.300]   because there's many routes to status.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.980]   The evolutionary psychologist, Bruce Ellis,
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.500]   talks about having many roles.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.180]   And I like that because in the old model,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.740]   you know, if there's one pyramid
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.060]   and you're kind of near the top, but not at the top,
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.980]   you've got a lot of incentive to destroy reputations,
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.260]   be, you know, mean girls type of behavior.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.860]   Bob Ferris, sociologist at Davis,
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.020]   finds that the most bullying in high school
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.180]   is the people that are like the 60th,
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.580]   the 85th percentile on popularity.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.460]   It's like you're near the top,
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.780]   but not all the way at the top.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.380]   - Yeah, this maps very well to Robert Sapolsky's work
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.500]   on primate troops.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.340]   - Yeah.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.700]   - Yeah, the alphas are stressed,
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:48.020]   but the sub alphas are, they have options.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.140]   - Yeah.
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.500]   - And this is true for female and male animals.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.380]   Just as it's true, we were talking about testosterone
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.260]   a few minutes ago in obsessive practice.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:00.200]   I'll remind people that in women,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.460]   they actually have more,
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.760]   adult women have more testosterone than they do estrogen.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.260]   If you look at a pure nanogram per deciliter comparison,
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.140]   it's just that overall,
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.040]   it tends to be on average less than in men.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.200]   - So the statement about testosterone
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   and obsessive learning or efforts to learn,
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.580]   I have to imagine is not restricted to males or females.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.420]   - Yeah, and I think, I understand as a man praising
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.180]   testosterone that I could come across,
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.480]   but I, so I always need to remember
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.180]   that the research is very interesting on T.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.340]   Eveline Krohn's lab did these great studies
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.780]   where they had kids starting age 10 to like 25,
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.760]   and they had them come in the lab twice,
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.380]   and they took testosterone levels,
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   but also had them do a bunch of tasks in the scanner.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.780]   And you can look at nucleus accumbens,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.020]   prefrontal cortex, et cetera.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:50.580]   - Areas associated with reward and pursuit motivation.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.760]   - Yeah, and they also had them do risk-taking tasks.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.020]   And what they find is that in both boys and girls,
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.500]   testosterone goes up over time.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.220]   Starts a little earlier in girls because gonadarchies
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.420]   one or two years before boys,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.340]   but the change score from one point to the next
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.660]   was equally predictive of neural reactivity
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.740]   during risk-taking tasks for both boys and girls.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:19.380]   So although boys end up with higher T throughout adolescence,
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.300]   the increase is equally predictive,
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.180]   which is another way of saying it's just as important
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.980]   for these social learning things in girls.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   And T, by the way, is just a really good--
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.820]   - Testosterone.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.820]   - Testosterone's a really good proxy.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.100]   Other hormones are involved too.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.140]   They're just more complicated.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.060]   Like DHEA, you could study as well,
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.060]   but that's part of the same metabolic pathway
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.420]   of cortisol and testosterone,
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.660]   so it's just messier and harder to interpret.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.620]   So we're not making claims specifically about testosterone.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.180]   It's just like a really good proxy
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.500]   for where you are in gonadal maturation.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.380]   In both boys and girls, gonadal maturation really matters
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.820]   for this kind of status, social-seeking part of your brain.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.220]   - Yeah, so if I understand correctly,
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.700]   the slope of the line of one's testosterone increase
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.220]   for both boys and girls is predictive of striving.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.820]   If it's a steep upward line,
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.500]   then that's associated with more striving
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.820]   in a given practice.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.420]   - To the extent that neural activation
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.220]   during a social reward task or a risk-taking task
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.100]   is a proxy for striving,
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.780]   and that's what a lot of people have argued, yeah.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.100]   - Do you think that striving reflects the action
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.300]   of kind of a basic neural circuit
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.420]   that then can be applied to other things
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.340]   or lots of different things?
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.140]   The reason I ask is that the notion of growth mindset
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:39.980]   is so attractive.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.020]   It's such a sticky idea,
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:46.340]   or I think because one imagines,
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.900]   okay, if I can get really good at one thing, chess,
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.580]   then I can apply the same kind of relationship
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.780]   to the internal state of stress or arousal, what have you,
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.140]   when trying to navigate a new environment of another kind,
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.780]   a physical practice or a relationship challenge
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.700]   or something of that sort.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.100]   You know, what we're really talking about here
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.140]   is an algorithm that can be directed at different pursuits,
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:14.020]   as opposed to growth mindset is applied in one context
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.640]   and not another.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.580]   So what of that?
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:23.180]   People who are incredibly good at accessing growth mindset
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.140]   in one domain of life,
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.180]   does that mean that they'll be good
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.900]   at accessing growth mindset in another domain of life?
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.700]   What's the carryover or the spillover?
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.540]   - It's a great question.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.380]   It comes up a lot.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:39.100]   The Michigan State psychologist, Jason Moser, studied this,
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.740]   and they measured growth mindset about your intelligence,
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.420]   the classic one, your personality, your morality,
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:50.000]   your social relationships, your emotions, et cetera.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.980]   And the question is,
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.180]   is there kind of like one growth mindset
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:56.260]   that applies in all the different ways,
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:00.740]   or are there totally narrow mindsets
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.040]   that have nothing to do with each other,
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.140]   or is it something in between?
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.580]   And the finding was that there is an overall association.
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.200]   If you think one trait can change and be developed,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.420]   you tend to think another trait can be changed and developed.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.540]   And just empirically, it's hard to separate that
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.060]   from people's general tendency to disagree
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.300]   or agree with items.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.260]   That could be what the common factor is,
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.960]   but it kind of makes sense.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.460]   However, there's also very domain-specific mindsets.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.500]   So there are people who think,
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:35.260]   yeah, I can get smarter, but I can't change my shyness.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.700]   And other people would think,
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.420]   my relationships are never gonna get better,
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:43.460]   but I can learn to play the cello, and vice versa.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.260]   And when you wanna predict behavior,
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.620]   turns out that the closer you are to that domain,
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.820]   the better the prediction is gonna be.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.740]   So if I wanna know if you're gonna quit
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.000]   playing the cello or not,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.140]   I'm gonna ask you your cello mindset.
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.340]   That's gonna do way better than,
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.400]   in general, can human qualities change?
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.460]   But if I'm gonna intervene,
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.180]   at what level should the intervention happen?
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.460]   If I only change your cello mindset,
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.300]   well, you're right.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.800]   Like, what if cello isn't your thing in life?
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.240]   Now are you gonna be fixed mindset
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.740]   for your relationships in school,
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   and did I not really help you?
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.740]   So kind of the empirical answer currently
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.840]   is if it's a domain
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.040]   that someone could be really defensive about,
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.320]   it's better to be a little vaguer about it.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.280]   Classic example is Aron Halperin's work
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.600]   on the Israel-Palestine conflict,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.400]   which is obviously a big issue right now.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.480]   Their science paper in 2011
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.180]   changed mindsets about group conflict in general.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:48.360]   Can an ethnic group or a national group ever change?
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.980]   They didn't go to people in Israel
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:53.020]   and say, "Palestinians can change,"
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.140]   'cause they're like, "No, they can't.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.980]   "That's not possible."
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.660]   But if they said, "You know, sometimes leaders change,
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.600]   "and then when leaders change,
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.980]   "the group's priorities change,
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.780]   "and they become more amenable to negotiation,
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:06.020]   "and when that happens, things can change."
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.540]   If that was done at a more general level,
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.500]   then both Israelis and Palestinians
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.580]   were more open to a peace process.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.240]   So I think if it's something you're very defensive about,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.240]   I tend to think back up and do the more abstract mindset.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.200]   Another example is,
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.100]   I remember I was in graduate school at Stanford,
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.860]   and one of my RAs was so excited about our work,
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.460]   and he went to a party and talked about it.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.020]   It's like that very Stanford thing to do
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.900]   is talk about research at a party,
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.860]   and he's like, "Oh, yeah, math ability can change.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.760]   "You don't have to be dumb at math forever."
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.720]   And the person he talked to was so offended.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.760]   She was like, "Are you telling me
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.220]   "I could've done better in high school math,
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.060]   "and I just didn't try hard enough?
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.980]   "And my life could be different?
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:49.320]   "So I could be an engineer right now?
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.280]   "Like, I like my life.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.660]   "Why are you telling?"
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.460]   It went down this road of,
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.620]   like, how dare you tell me it could've been different?
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.940]   And who knows, maybe he had bad delivery
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:03.240]   and had 14 margaritas, and who knows what happened.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.220]   But I think the idea is like,
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:10.220]   if someone's got a reason to think about that fixed mindset
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:15.060]   as comforting in some way,
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.740]   that they don't have to feel bad about something
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.660]   that could've been different,
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.440]   it's probably not smart to go after that
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.220]   in a very specific way.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.700]   But if someone's not defensive,
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.540]   generally the closer to the domain, the better,
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.260]   because they're gonna see the application.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.900]   Otherwise, they have to use it by analogy,
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.380]   and we know analogic reasoning is tough,
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.360]   'cause it's hit or miss.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.900]   - We love stories of people that have come from a place
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.740]   of being really back on their heels,
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:44.220]   or even just dissolved into a puddle of their own tears,
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.100]   to doing well again, maybe even soaring again.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.380]   It's sort of the common thing
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.400]   is that this is the classic American story,
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.660]   although it's true of people all over the world, I imagine.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.460]   - Right, it's not always true in America either,
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.380]   but yeah, we love the story.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.580]   - Yeah, some people crash and burn,
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:04.260]   but it seems like everybody loves a comeback story.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.700]   I don't know, something about that.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:11.580]   The hero's journey, the hero of a thousand faces,
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.380]   is that the book, Joseph Campbell?
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.780]   And it's written into so many movies and books
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.980]   and real-life stories.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:24.100]   I can't help but superimpose today's discussion
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.980]   onto something like that, that life is a series
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.480]   of efforts to apply growth mindset
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.940]   from learning how to walk, presumably as part of that.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:36.780]   I don't know any child
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   that just stands up and walks early on,
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:43.020]   to the things that we really think we can perform well at,
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.400]   to finding ourselves really back on our heels.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.800]   And so are there any data or theories even
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.980]   that point to the use of growth mindset
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.220]   and stress-enhancing mindset
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.660]   in coming from a real place of deficit?
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.460]   Not just from trying to do better and learn new things,
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.380]   but from a real place of deficit, a real place of challenge.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.320]   I think it's important for our audience to hear
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.500]   because I think a number of people
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.260]   do feel back on their heels in one or more domains of life.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.100]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.420]   I mean, I think that the data suggests
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.300]   that growth mindset becomes most relevant
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.700]   to your next behavior, the more challenge you face.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.540]   And so for a long time, what that meant is
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.900]   if you maybe were a low-achieving student,
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.780]   and we're gonna evaluate growth mindset
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.900]   by looking at your grades, you should see bigger gains
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.260]   for low-achieving students
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.440]   compared to high-achieving students.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.380]   Part of that could be an artifact.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.420]   If you already have straight As,
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.240]   we can't give you more As, it's impossible, right?
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:46.240]   But in general, psychological treatments
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.820]   like a growth mindset tend to work better
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.500]   for people who counterfactually wouldn't have them
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.060]   and could plausibly benefit from them.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.300]   Where the story becomes more interesting
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.460]   is that often your kind of own individual difficulties
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:03.140]   are associated with your environment.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.440]   And the environment is really what allows you
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.900]   to apply your growth mindset over time.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.380]   So it might make you right now need a growth mindset more,
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.460]   but it might make it harder for you to act on it.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:18.580]   And so for people who like complex three-way interactions,
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.500]   the idea is that a treatment for growth mindset
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.620]   should work best for individuals
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.460]   who face the most challenges
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:28.980]   but are in the most supportive environments.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.900]   And one is like baseline, why do you need it?
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.620]   And the other is over time,
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.660]   what's gonna help you keep using it?
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.860]   So to be very concrete about this,
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:40.760]   in one paper we published in 2019,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.340]   the National Study of Learning Mindsets,
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.980]   it was published in Nature.
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   We evaluated growth mindset in this large national sample
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.780]   and the question wasn't, does it work on average?
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.660]   The question was, where does it work and for whom?
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.620]   'Cause there were lots of replications already
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:58.740]   and sometimes people tried it and like,
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.720]   well, it didn't work here.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.800]   Okay, well, that's a puzzle, how do we figure that out?
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.220]   And the finding was low-achieving students in high schools
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.220]   that had more supportive classroom culture
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.100]   where you got the long run effects.
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.580]   And in the four-year results,
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.060]   it's low-achieving students in high schools
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.540]   that offered more advanced courses.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.820]   So if you're a low-achieving student,
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.780]   you get with mindset, it's like, great, give me pre-calculus.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.840]   Oh, we don't offer that here, right?
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.900]   Or it's a toxic environment in some way.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.220]   Their teachers are untrained, they're first-year teachers.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.620]   There's lots of poverty in the school.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:38.060]   If you don't have the structure to support the striving,
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.580]   you don't get the long run effects,
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.260]   especially if the effects you're looking at
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.940]   are increases in equality of opportunity.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.500]   So for me, the message is like,
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.100]   you think about growth mindset
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:53.420]   and psychological interventions as one tool in a toolkit
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.860]   to help people achieve their goals,
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:58.660]   but we can't forget about the entire field of sociology
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.340]   that tells us a lot about the allocation of resources
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.740]   through which people can even be afforded
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.440]   the chance to pursue their goals.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.660]   And so what I like about that finding,
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.580]   which by the way came from a collaboration with sociologists
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.380]   who thought, you psychologists are absurd.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.860]   They're like, you think your little mindset
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.860]   is gonna change inequality?
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.820]   Like, you're gonna make an argument to 15-year-olds
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.500]   and that's your plan for improving the American economy.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.620]   That's absurd.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:28.380]   I was like, well, I don't know, you could do something.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.740]   And psychologists are skeptical of sociologists.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.860]   They're like, look, how often do we have huge changes
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.740]   in law and policy, but people don't take advantage
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.000]   of the resources that are available to them?
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.580]   Let's change the behavior so they take advantage.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:44.700]   We kind of came together and said,
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.300]   what does it look like to consider both the structure
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.820]   and the internal psychology?
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:52.280]   And I think this was a very important point
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.460]   because people tend to choose one or the other.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.020]   Either we're gonna lobby for new laws
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.260]   to reallocate resources, or we're gonna optimize
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.100]   the psychology of the individual.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.660]   And I think our perspective is to find ways
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.420]   to bring those two together and kind of do both.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:13.580]   And ultimately, it's not a deficit-based perspective
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.540]   of you have a deficit and we're fixing that.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.340]   Growth mindset's more like,
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.540]   well, it's an asset-based perspective.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:24.260]   What I mean by that is we're not giving someone motivation
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.820]   in growth mindset.
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:29.560]   We're presuming people already kind of wanna do well.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.140]   They wanna impress others, they wanna be meaningful,
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.460]   they wanna contribute, but there's a barrier.
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:40.420]   The barrier is when you strive and then inevitably struggle,
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.920]   if you're pushing yourself beyond your abilities,
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.420]   people make you feel dumb for that struggle.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:51.140]   So we're trying to remove that cultural and social barrier
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.700]   that's preventing people from their natural goal pursuit.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.900]   And that comes deeply from Carol Dweck's original work
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.620]   at the intersection of developmental and social psychology.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.980]   The basic claim in developmental psychology
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.260]   is the human being is an active learner
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.140]   who's trying to figure out the world.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.140]   This is classic Alison Gopnik, Susan Gellman.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:13.540]   Infants are meaning makers trying to interpret the world
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.900]   and wanting to do well.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.180]   And eventually, they're socialized into beliefs
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.100]   that prevent them from acting on that basic neural desire
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.580]   to learn and grow, develop, et cetera.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.620]   And growth mindset is really,
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.500]   it's not trying to be a magic pill
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.060]   to give an unmotivated, disaffected kid
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.100]   a shot in the arm of adrenaline so they go out and learn.
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:39.980]   No, it presumes agency and love of learning
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.900]   and kind of like Dr. Beck, he said,
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.640]   presumes the goodness in kids
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.300]   and tries to remove whatever kind of garbage beliefs
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.540]   they've learned from social context.
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:54.220]   And then our long-term studies then show how
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.700]   once you do that, if you're also in a context
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.220]   where you can act on that love of learning,
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.580]   then you can see long-run effects
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.580]   that are far more than what a lot of people
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:08.140]   have said you could get even in a disadvantaged context.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:11.260]   - It's so interesting because what we're talking about here
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.660]   is psychological theory playing out in the real world,
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:18.160]   but also kind of like deep notions of the human spirit.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.160]   Like we are a species that seems to organize our experience
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.800]   in terms of stories of ourselves and others,
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.920]   but that when it comes to things like strivings and learning,
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:37.880]   are really always in a constant state of either being more,
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.480]   to borrow the words of a friend of mine,
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.120]   either back on our heels, flat-footed,
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.220]   or forward center of mass, right?
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.080]   And what we're talking about today
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.160]   as being forward center of mass,
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.760]   at least in certain areas of life.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.400]   I mean, the fact that the reward systems of the brain,
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.800]   whether you mentioned them earlier,
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.360]   these mesolimbic reward pathways
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.320]   that basically deploy dopamine and other things, of course,
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.840]   are so associated with striving and achieving,
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.640]   striving and achieving, and presumably underlie
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.880]   much if not all of our human evolution,
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.120]   assuming we're still evolving.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.440]   Lately, sometimes I wonder,
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.880]   but some people would argue we're devolving,
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.880]   but I would argue we're still evolving,
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.800]   especially with this new burst in AI.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.440]   It's all about math nowadays, folks.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.000]   A few years ago, it was all about neuroscience,
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.440]   and neuroscience is still really important,
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.200]   and the two share, but it's all about math lately.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.160]   So I like to just think of the human animal
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.600]   as so different than the other animals of the planet.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.280]   Like we're the curators of the planet.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.680]   The house cats might be striving,
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.700]   but they're clearly not doing as well as we are
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.020]   in terms of managing the way the world goes.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.840]   So do you think that this is like a basic algorithm
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.240]   within human beings to look at ourselves,
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.840]   look at the environment, see challenges,
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.760]   overcome challenges, develop technologies?
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.000]   It's just kind of like a,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.600]   it's like the same way my bulldog
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.280]   used to like to gnaw on things.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.960]   You know, you like to chew and pull.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   We just want to learn and grow.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.360]   Do you think it's inherent to who we are as a species,
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.160]   maybe even what sets our species apart from all the others?
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.560]   - I mean, that's a profound question,
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.740]   and I think that's a good one to debate.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:12.240]   What I've been really taken by recently
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.280]   is Carol Dweck's "Secret Life as a Neuroscientist."
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.120]   She has this great psych review paper
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   that contradicts a lot of received wisdom
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:28.400]   about the prefrontal planning regions of the brain
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.920]   and the kind of amygdala and the hippocampus,
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.360]   the, you know, the affective regions
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.400]   and the memory creation regions.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.640]   And the classic argument,
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.020]   and going back to Plato and the Phaedrus, right,
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.580]   is that the rational acting part of the brain
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:48.440]   plans out what it wants, makes all these calculations,
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.680]   and then has to tame the emotional part
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.240]   in order to make those goals into a reality.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.760]   And so the emotion, you know, the amygdala, the mesolimbic,
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.040]   that's this unruly horse
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:05.720]   that the charioteer has to harness, you know?
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.200]   And I think that Carol argued,
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.660]   and I think other people have argued too.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.360]   I've seen Adriana Galvan and Ron Dahl and others argue this,
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.280]   that the affective regions are often the teacher
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.880]   and the prefrontal is the student.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.720]   And that makes sense if you think
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:24.160]   about how humans are goal-directed.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.420]   Think about how a kid learns to walk.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.440]   They don't do that for theoretical reasons.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.840]   They don't just like look at people walking
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.240]   and be like, "I wanna learn how to do that."
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.080]   - Right.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.000]   - I have four kids.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.360]   It's usually because there's a toy
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.700]   at the other side of the room that they really, really want
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.980]   and that I don't want them to have.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:42.540]   And the only way for them to go get it,
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.500]   'cause I won't get it for them,
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.940]   is for them to learn how to walk.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.300]   So the motor learning is the effect of the desire
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.700]   in the goal pursuit.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.260]   And what Carol argued is that
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.520]   Phaedra's Hat is totally wrong.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.540]   It's not that the prefrontal charioteer
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.860]   is taming the emotional.
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.280]   It's really that the affective part
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.220]   is training the prefrontal to be better
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.820]   at pursuing the goals that matter
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.780]   in the social milieu that you have.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:12.420]   And a lot of people like Adriana Galvan and Jen Pfeiffer
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.660]   and Nim Tottenham in the adolescent space
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.580]   have shown this, and I don't understand
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.480]   all the details fully, but the argument that I've heard
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.660]   is that once the scanning studies were able to switch
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:30.020]   from fMRI focused on simple activation
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.820]   to studies looking at connectivity,
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:35.060]   and where you could get temporal ordering,
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.260]   then you could start seeing actually that,
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:41.260]   especially in adolescence, it's the affective regions
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.380]   are training or teaching or telling
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:45.420]   the prefrontal regions what to do.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.380]   So I guess that's a long way of answering the question
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.220]   of I think that, I think goal pursuit
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.560]   is fundamental to human nature.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.020]   And I think that the brain and our adaptation
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:00.120]   is designed to help us learn how to be a lot better
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.080]   at pursuing whatever goals will help us survive
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.500]   in our environment.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.300]   And the brain has to be adaptive
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.620]   to that environmental input
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.300]   because the environment's always changing.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.420]   If it had only one way of pursuing its goals,
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.500]   then we would never survive.
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.380]   So it has to be the case that the planning, rational,
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.180]   observing part of the brain is actually responsive
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.740]   to what works in your context for goal pursuit.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.680]   So again, I'm summarizing other people's work here,
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.940]   but that's how I see it, yeah.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:32.820]   - I completely agree that emotions drive the more,
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.860]   let's call tactical circuitry of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.140]   Of course, we should be fair to the neuroscience.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.100]   The prefrontal cortex is part of the limbic system.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.020]   People often think because it's in the cortex,
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.620]   it's higher order, and that's simply not true.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.640]   But well, if we both agree, and it sounds like we do,
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:52.600]   that emotions drive tactical decisions
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.580]   that drive action and learning,
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:59.860]   maybe we could talk about the two major types of emotions
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.580]   that one could imagine.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.040]   One is I really want the toy.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.340]   I really want the piece of food.
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:09.540]   I really need something for survival or for wellbeing,
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.140]   and so I'm going to be motivated,
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:14.220]   and then the prefrontal cortex will work out the strategies
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:18.660]   and balance out the relationship to stress, et cetera,
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.100]   and remind ourselves that stress
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.220]   can be performance enhancing,
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:25.420]   and eventually we get the thing or the skill or the whatever.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:29.480]   The other would be fear, fear of social shame,
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.700]   fear of staying in a place that's not good for us
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.180]   financially, emotionally, socially, et cetera.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:38.780]   Is there any work that identifies whether or not
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:42.340]   that the core emotion driving motivation is relevant,
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.580]   and is there a role for growth mindset there?
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.640]   - That's interesting.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.740]   - I guess put simply, take it out of the ivory tower
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:54.780]   a little bit, which is what we're doing here anyway.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.220]   You can do things out of love.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.580]   You can do things out of fear.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.080]   You do for both reasons too.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:25:59.920]   - Yeah.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.480]   - You can do things to please yourself.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.600]   You can do things to please others.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.560]   You can do things to avoid others being disappointed in you,
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.120]   you being disappointed in yourself.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.520]   Presumably it's both.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.360]   - Yeah.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.860]   - But is there any, I'm dying for you to tell me
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.680]   that when we do things out of love, we learn faster,
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.160]   but maybe that's not the case.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:17.980]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:20.080]   I mean, so two thoughts.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.600]   One is just honoring Danny Kahneman, who just passed away.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.660]   His work with Amos Tversky took on a version
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.980]   of this question in prospect theory,
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:33.700]   and it's the idea of does the fear of a loss
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:37.360]   motivate us more than the prospect of a gain, right?
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.580]   And their argument is that both can be motivating
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:44.780]   as well as the possibility of a loss,
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:47.160]   but that loss is loomed larger,
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.080]   that people are more willing to take a risky gamble
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.080]   to prevent a loss than they are to get a numerically equal,
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.720]   like a mathematically equal gain.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.940]   And so a lot of people have used that information
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:05.040]   in various ways, and I think that that has led people
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.020]   to conclude that the prospect of a gain
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.740]   doesn't mean anything.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.900]   But that really wasn't ever the point in prospect theory.
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.380]   It's just that it's a little more powerful
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.540]   to avoid, to be afraid of a loss.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.880]   I don't see a problem with thinking like,
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.760]   yeah, losses are a little worse.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.580]   If I already had $1,000 and you took it away,
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.920]   feels a little worse than the chance to win 1,000
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.320]   that I didn't win.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.460]   Mathematically, it's the same delta.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:38.960]   But I think that the way that behavioral economic work
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.580]   gets applied is to appeal to people's kind of basis
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:47.640]   and most fearful responses to things.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.340]   And if you think about what drives a lot of excellence,
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.160]   in moral exemplars too,
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.280]   it's this chance to feel like you've made
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.960]   a big contribution to others.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.600]   And I don't think people are afraid
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:08.680]   that they didn't help as many people as they could have.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.800]   And maybe that drives some people.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:13.500]   But I think just the affective forecasting
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.260]   of one day I'll feel good
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.100]   because of the meaningful work I did for others,
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.100]   that was high integrity when no one else would have seen it.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.220]   I think that's really motivating for a lot of people.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.020]   And I think we underappreciate that.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:32.460]   And therefore, we appeal to very narrow self-interest.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:35.180]   And my favorite theorist on this is Dale Millers
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.900]   at the Stanford Business School.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.460]   And he calls it the norm of self-interest.
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.440]   That if you look around,
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.280]   it looks like everyone's behaving
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:46.940]   for only very narrow short-term self-interested reasons.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:49.100]   And because you think that's the norm,
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.660]   then you yourself kind of respond to those incentives.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.900]   And then you then in turn create that norm
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.780]   even more than other people see.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:59.180]   But it's not a state of affairs that anybody really likes.
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.960]   Everybody kinds of prefers a pro-social world
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.460]   where people are helping others.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.980]   But if you think that's just a really weird thing to do
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.040]   and not normal, then people conform to the wrong norm.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:13.180]   So in my work, what I try to emphasize
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:15.380]   is not that we're not afraid of losses
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:19.420]   and the narrow short-term gain that we're avoiding,
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.060]   or the short-term loss we're avoiding.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.220]   But I really do think that people are capable
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:29.000]   of far more beautiful contributions to the world
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.220]   when we assume that that's what they want
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.100]   and we create opportunities for them to do that.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.540]   - Yeah, I've seen that so much.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:39.460]   You look at some of the best managers, right?
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:42.420]   It's not just if you screw up,
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.940]   you're gonna lose your bonus.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.580]   Like that's not what the best managers
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:48.180]   in the world are doing, right?
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:51.500]   They're like, let's do something no one's ever done before.
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.100]   Let me support you to do it.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.100]   And then let me make sure that you look awesome
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:56.640]   in front of all the senior vice presidents
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.460]   because you did that.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.300]   Like that's what the best managers do.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.660]   And coaches too.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.340]   - For my book, I interviewed the NBA's best shooting coach.
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:10.220]   This basketball player named Shane Battier
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:14.080]   who played college and pro basketball told me about him.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:17.660]   And I interviewed Chip, England is his name.
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:20.180]   And he was at the San Antonio Spurs,
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:23.700]   which they had a 17 year run of being a perennial contender
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.460]   for the NBA championships.
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:29.700]   And constantly drafted players who were talented
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.980]   but had a bad jump shot.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.700]   So Kawhi Leonard is an example
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.340]   where it fell late in the first round
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:35.780]   because people thought couldn't shoot.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.780]   Tony Parker is another example.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.140]   When Tony Parker used to shoot, Greg Popovich would say,
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.700]   that's a turnover every time.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:46.580]   Chip England is a great shooting coach, worked with them.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.780]   There's lots of Bill Barnwell had a great story about him,
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:50.580]   called him the shot doctor.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:54.300]   And I interviewed Chip and I was like,
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.220]   Chip, how do you sell the vision to these players
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.860]   who are 18 to 21, are newfound millionaires.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:04.660]   Everyone's saying you're the best, you're a first rounder.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.060]   And they don't wanna change their shot
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:10.900]   because if they do, they could mess it up, make it worse.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:13.700]   Like a golfer is superstitious about their shot.
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.820]   And he's like, the number one thing I have to do
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:16.980]   is build trust.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.020]   'Cause I can't critique a player's shot
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.020]   and make them change it
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.440]   if they think they're gonna sacrifice more.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.740]   So he's like, Dave, the first thing you have to do
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.580]   is sell your vision.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.420]   I was like, well, what's your vision?
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:33.220]   He's like, he doesn't say, if you don't change your shot,
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.660]   you are gonna lose millions of dollars
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:36.180]   and be out of the league.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.860]   So he doesn't motivate with a fear of loss.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:43.100]   He says, the average time in the league
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:44.880]   is two and a half years, right?
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.940]   If you develop a great reliable jump shot
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.700]   where even as your athletic talents decline,
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.420]   you're still reliable.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:54.340]   You're talking about a 10 year career.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.740]   And then you're not just helping you,
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.700]   you're not just helping your family,
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.060]   you're helping your family's family.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:02.340]   So even in the like money obsessed throat world
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:03.740]   or professional sports,
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:07.740]   the single best coach working with the top players
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:11.180]   appeals to the prospect of what you could do for others,
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.340]   not the fear of loss.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.660]   And to me, that's really telling.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.180]   Like if it works to just motivate with the fear of loss,
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.020]   that's what he would do.
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.220]   'Cause they would do whatever's effective.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.340]   It's like at some level an efficient market,
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:25.300]   but that's not what Chip England does.
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:26.380]   And I think the same is true
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.940]   for a lot of other great mentors and leaders.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.500]   - So if I understand correctly,
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.540]   when we find ourselves
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:39.220]   back on our heels or flat footed,
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.500]   we want to focus on the prospect
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.660]   of what we can do for others.
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.820]   Like ultimately that's going to be the best.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:47.660]   - Or the world, yeah.
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.180]   - Or the world, yeah.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:52.300]   I guess, yeah, pick your, pick your scope of impact.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.900]   - Yeah, could be for art, for intellectual history.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.140]   It's a classic Viktor Frankl argument
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:59.220]   of man's search for meaning, right?
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:03.060]   As Viktor Frankl's leaving the concentration camps,
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:05.180]   what helps him survive?
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:10.180]   And it's the debt that he owes to the future work
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.900]   that he wants to write to share with the world.
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.100]   And it's not the fear of death.
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.900]   It's the meaning of the work he could do for the world
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.820]   if he survives.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:25.860]   - Yeah, I think I'd like to hover on this for a minute or two
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.900]   'cause I think it's really important.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:28.900]   I realized we're getting more philosophical
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.460]   than operational, but--
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.620]   - We have data on this, it's a--
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:33.860]   - Yeah, I'd love to hear it.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.300]   That's one of the things I'm really enjoying
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:36.420]   about this conversation at the moment.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:37.860]   I think it's going to be abstract
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:41.920]   or that you've got it all there in that brain.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.740]   Yeah, let's talk about this,
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.420]   that when we feel back on our heels or we're flat footed,
[01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.220]   meaning we're not doing well,
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:51.740]   maybe hard things have happened,
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.980]   focusing on the prospect of what we can do for others,
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.180]   not just trying to avoid loss or further shame
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:00.180]   or just diminishment is going to be the best thing.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:03.460]   So what are the data on this?
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:06.800]   - Yeah, so we'll first just look at correlational studies
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.520]   in these global surveys of happiness.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.900]   In almost anyone you can think of,
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.660]   the best predictor of life satisfaction and wellbeing
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.540]   is going to be the meaning of your life,
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:22.520]   in particular, the feeling like you're connected to others,
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.380]   you've contributed to others.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:25.540]   - That your life mattered.
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.900]   - That your life, there was something of value
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:30.940]   in your life to others or to the world, right?
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:36.100]   And so just anecdotally, the advice I always give to people
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:38.580]   like going through depression or the risk of that
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.240]   is to focus on what you can do for others
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.180]   or what you have done, right?
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:46.660]   So that's just correlationally.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:50.540]   Now, experimentally, what we did in some work,
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:53.060]   this was started with my first advisor at Stanford,
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:55.620]   Bill Damon, who studies purpose in life,
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:59.140]   is we asked the question of when you're going through
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.600]   something tedious, boring, frustrating,
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.900]   what motivates you to keep going?
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.180]   And there are many possible answers to that,
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:10.760]   but we compared two different ones.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.760]   One is the potential benefit you get out of that striving.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.920]   So for a student in school,
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.440]   it's like the money you would get one day
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.200]   from working hard and doing well.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.840]   An alternative though, is what you could do
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.620]   with the knowledge that you gained
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:32.520]   by going through the hard learning.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.480]   How could you contribute to others, make a difference,
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.200]   et cetera, with the knowledge and skills?
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.720]   We call that our purpose condition.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.680]   A couple of things make that different
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.280]   from the standard narrative,
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.000]   but I think ultimately intuitive.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.960]   One is the standard narrative is if you try hard in school
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:55.360]   or at work or whatever it is and suffer now,
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.160]   then one day there will be a kind of financial compensation.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.180]   So you're suffering now in a way
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.440]   that will bring material reward in the future.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.480]   The brain's not really designed
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.640]   to make that kind of calculation, right?
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.680]   It's like, well, how certain is the reward in the future?
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.880]   How far into the future?
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.120]   And how bad is the punishment right now?
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.840]   So there's all kinds of affective trade-offs
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.880]   that are hard for anyone
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.640]   or especially hard for 13-year-olds, right?
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.480]   So what a lot of school comes down to is an adult saying,
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.760]   "You need to suffer through 40 minutes per day
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.640]   "of factoring trinomials because I said so,
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.240]   "and I said it's good for your long-term future
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.560]   "so that one day in your 30s,
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.820]   "you can barely afford a mortgage," right?
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:37.060]   This is not a compelling argument
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:39.880]   for most of America's youth, my opinion.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.360]   The purpose condition though,
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.000]   is not about the exchange value of a credential
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]   some long time in the future.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.040]   It's more like right now,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.980]   you're getting a hard and kind of admirable skill
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.760]   that not everyone's gonna get.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.000]   And you're gonna then be prepared when the moment arises
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.760]   to do something of significance for others.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.120]   Now that also is uncertain and in the future,
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.840]   but for things that are contributions,
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.240]   you kind of get to feel like a good person right now.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.700]   The analogy I often use is if I'm gonna like make lunch
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.200]   for the homeless,
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.160]   I don't have to wait until they actually eat the food
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.200]   to feel like a good person.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.720]   I feel like a good person when I'm putting it in the bag,
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.600]   or even when I'm driving to the homeless shelter, right?
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:24.560]   And I think our idea was you can move up the reward
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.860]   by making it a social reward right now,
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:31.280]   rather than a material reward years into the future.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.660]   - Because then the pursuit itself becomes the reward.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.200]   - Right, right now my,
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.000]   and actually the more frustrating it is right now,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.680]   the more I'm being a good person
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.520]   because it means it was a hard skill to acquire
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:43.480]   that'll prepare me to make a difference later.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:47.860]   And so we framed super tedious math.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:50.440]   This is with Angela Duckworth and Sidney D'Mello
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.060]   and Dave Ponescu and others as Marlon Henderson,
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:57.680]   as a chance to gain a skill that helps you contribute
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.440]   versus a chance to learn how to get an A
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.200]   and make money in the future versus a control.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.840]   And what we found was that the contribute to others version
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.540]   led to deeper learning, greater persistence,
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:16.220]   higher grades over time.
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:20.080]   And in one of our experiments,
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.680]   we gave them a choice of either doing super boring math
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.200]   or goofing off on the internet.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.480]   And we were secretly tracking
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   what the websites they were going to.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:32.480]   And we found that teenagers did more very boring math
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:37.200]   and watched fewer videos and played less Tetris
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.280]   when they were given this purpose message before the task.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.820]   It's in our 2014 paper.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:45.300]   And what I always think about,
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.560]   that's the kind of paper I wanted to go to graduate school
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.680]   to work on.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.640]   But I think about it because if you think about
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.900]   Dale Miller's norm of self-interest,
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.920]   nobody thinks to do the purpose argument.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.000]   They're like, of course, teenagers are short-sighted
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.440]   and think about material rewards
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.040]   and all they wanna do is either look cool
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.560]   or make money or whatever.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.520]   But no, like in our studies,
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:11.220]   if you appeal to the chance to make a contribution right now,
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:14.520]   then they did the behaviors that adults want them to do.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.200]   They didn't goof off online and instead chose boring math.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.680]   And adults think the only way you could ever get that
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.520]   is by imposing our will
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:30.160]   and was this kind of authoritarian set of rules.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.800]   But if you instead just appeal to the love of learning
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.840]   for the sake of others,
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.720]   then they're willing to kind of go through the suffering.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.280]   And in the paper, we cite Viktor Frankl,
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.440]   where the person who knows the why for their existence
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.560]   is able to bear any how.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.660]   And I think about that a lot,
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.280]   that we underestimate how willing young people are,
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:55.580]   really anyone is, to bear through things
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.340]   that are hard and difficult if they have a strong why.
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:01.820]   - I think this is one of the most important concepts,
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:03.720]   frankly, ever discussed on this podcast,
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.880]   if I'm really honest.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.280]   I think that we've parsed dopamine circuits
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.160]   and we've talked about motivation and reward.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.680]   We've talked a little bit about growth mindset
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:13.560]   in a solo episode,
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.840]   but never before have I really understood
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.200]   the why component, the meaning component.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.440]   And I love how it marries so much of what we hear
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.820]   in kind of like pop culture psychology with real data.
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.560]   Like we're finally, thanks to you being here,
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.660]   meaning we're finally in the guts of it.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:35.620]   Because we hear this like,
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:38.200]   oh, it feels so good to make a contribution,
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.220]   but you know, people are also self-interested.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.420]   - Yeah. - People want money.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.860]   Then people say, well, past a certain amount of money,
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:44.860]   you don't get any happier.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:48.000]   And I would argue that it's true,
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.080]   money can't buy happiness,
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.820]   but it can definitely buffer stress.
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:52.980]   - Yeah. - Not all forms of stress.
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.900]   And money itself can get people into more stress.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:56.660]   But anyone that says, you know,
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:58.700]   past blank number of dollars,
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.660]   there's no incremental increase in happiness.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:04.780]   I just don't see how that could be given inflation.
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.860]   - No, that treats humans like linear functions.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:07.700]   - Right. - I think that's
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.220]   a simplification. - Right.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.740]   If higher purpose is best defined
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.300]   as making a meaningful contribution to the world,
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.860]   to a community, or maybe at the scale of the world,
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:19.980]   maybe at the scale of a family or what have you,
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.460]   a classroom.
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:24.340]   And the thing that you said before that seems so important
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:28.100]   is that the moment that you attach your goal
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.100]   to something that's for others,
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.260]   it makes the effort involved its own form of reward.
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.100]   - Yeah.
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.060]   - That to me is so important.
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:39.520]   - Yeah. - So, so important.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.340]   I kind of want to highlight bold, underline,
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:43.740]   and put a big exclamation mark after it,
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.820]   because that's so different than like,
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:48.080]   oh, you know, I want to be the top player on the team.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:48.920]   - Yeah.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.340]   - Which means that every bit of effort you put in,
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.980]   you're like thinking, I'm going to be the best,
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:53.980]   I'm going to be the best, I'm going to be the best.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:58.300]   But, and one perhaps can then feel that progress
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:41:59.820]   when one is making it,
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:02.980]   and feel like they're ascending that staircase.
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.620]   But something additional must come about
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:11.340]   when we're invoking this feeling of contribution.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:15.180]   And I think this is essential to our evolution as a species,
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:16.780]   'cause we didn't develop in isolation.
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:18.700]   - Yeah, I mean, we had to show our value to the group
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.100]   or else they would get rid of us, right?
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.140]   I mean, that's what it meant to go from being a child
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:23.560]   to being an adult.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.060]   And the, think about what it,
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.260]   let's take basketball or whatever, right?
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.900]   If I'm trying super, super hard
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:34.820]   and it feels impossible to me and I'm not getting better,
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.820]   and it's purely for me, then I feel like a failure.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.940]   It feels like my goals are not being met
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.460]   and they never will be met, right?
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.060]   The effort feels terrible
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:48.820]   because it means something really bad about me, right?
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:51.660]   Now imagine you're putting in effort for others.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:54.160]   The harder it is, the more awesome it is
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.160]   because it's more noble, right?
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.960]   You've done something that's super impressive
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.320]   and sacrificed your own happiness for others, right?
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:07.320]   The social status of trying hard and failing for yourself
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:13.400]   is net negative because it's about shame, humiliation,
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.760]   I'm not good enough.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.640]   The status of trying hard and failing
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.840]   and keeping going for others is like super net positive,
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:21.680]   right?
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.120]   And I think that's what people fail to appreciate
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.660]   is especially someone young
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.660]   or even just early in a career, right?
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.100]   Starting out, if you can reframe difficulty and failure
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.380]   as part of the process of doing something
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.120]   with high integrity for others,
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.880]   like it changes the meaning of effort totally.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.440]   And once you have a different meaning,
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.480]   then something that previously felt bad
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.220]   can instead be motivating.
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.400]   Whether it's the stress,
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.720]   like in our stress enhancing work,
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.760]   or the boredom you're undergoing,
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.920]   it's doing something super tedious or anything like that.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:00.520]   I remember when I was at Stanford as a graduate student,
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.480]   I worked in the lab of John Krasnick,
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.520]   who is famously detail-oriented.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:10.800]   Whenever we wanna go in really deep into something
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.360]   and go beyond what any other scientists would do,
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.520]   our joke name for that is giving it the full Krasnick
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.480]   because he's in communications and political science.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:23.040]   And there was one project I was supervising
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.880]   where this will sound ridiculous,
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.880]   but it was what is the best adjective
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.640]   to use in a survey item?
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.680]   So say you wanna go like, how hungry are you?
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.080]   Not at all, very, extremely,
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.840]   like what adjectives should you pick
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.000]   to label those in a survey item?
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.640]   And so the task was to find every time
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.520]   that human beings have rated adjectives
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.680]   on a zero to 100 scale in the history of science,
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.640]   and then average across all those
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:52.520]   to choose optimally spaced adjectives,
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:55.840]   like not at all, a lot, little.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:59.160]   So we had a lab full of undergraduates at Stanford
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:03.040]   who are used to creating startups and running nonprofits,
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.800]   and this is very tedious work for them.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.440]   So how do you get them to super pay attention
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.360]   to all the details and not get it wrong?
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.360]   Where are we really gonna trust their work?
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:15.560]   It's not by saying you're gonna get into law school
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.160]   if you do this, because it's not really true.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.600]   And they'd be like, there's a lot of other ways
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.800]   for me to get into law school
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.720]   that don't involve going to journals from the 1920s
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.000]   to rate adjectives, right?
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.520]   Instead, what I started doing
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.120]   was give them what I call the save the world speech,
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:34.720]   which is like, look, we're gonna write this paper,
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.480]   and it's gonna be the kind of paper
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.200]   that no one would have done 'cause it's so tedious.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:43.160]   But if it's trustworthy, thousands of people
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.880]   would know how to have more accurate measurement,
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.840]   and they're gonna be so grateful for that.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.840]   But not only that, there'll be skeptics,
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.000]   and the skeptics are gonna look in our supplement,
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.680]   they're gonna find mistakes,
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.920]   and then they're gonna email the editor,
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:55.760]   and they're gonna say,
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.560]   why did you let this sloppy work into the journal?
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.280]   And that happens all the time.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.120]   I mean, I don't know how much you follow
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:06.040]   what's happening to behavioral scientists these days,
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:09.940]   but if you have an influential finding, that's the norm,
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:12.040]   is people should scrutinize it, they should kick the tires,
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.540]   and they're gonna find it, and they're gonna out you.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:17.280]   - And they're doing more of that now, like with PubPeer,
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.120]   which I think is great.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.600]   PubPeer is awesome.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:23.920]   PubPeer, folks, is where papers are evaluated online.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.280]   People find sometimes outright errors,
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.720]   and sure, there are those like sleuthing for-
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:31.560]   - Yeah, you find fraud.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.520]   - For fraud, but most of what's put there
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.280]   is stuff like differences in interpretation,
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.560]   or somebody will suggest that the authors
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.920]   could have done a better analysis,
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.120]   or that maybe their conclusions
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.200]   were a little too far-reaching
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.660]   based on a particular set of methods.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.240]   - And I think it's good for science.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.880]   I mean, there's a lot of bad-intentioned sleuthing
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.160]   that is trying to find circumstantial evidence
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.340]   to make someone look bad.
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:55.800]   - Is that true? - Yeah.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.640]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640]   - That's a shame, because the whole purpose of it
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:01.560]   is to better the work, not to...
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.320]   I'm assuming the whole purpose of PubPeer
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.560]   is to better the work, and of course,
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.880]   point out where there are real errors
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.040]   in the historical literature.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.640]   - Right, well, I think that the...
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.840]   Yes, there's a new way to become famous in science,
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:21.000]   which is to find errors, which, again,
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.080]   is really valuable if you successfully do it,
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.400]   but there's enough room for interpretation
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:30.080]   that someone can, with circumstantial evidence only,
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.860]   make it look like something's really bad,
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:33.800]   and then cause an alarm,
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:36.120]   and it causes all kinds of problems.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.040]   However, for me, at least in our lab,
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.000]   that if you always assume
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.320]   that someone will look at your work
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.040]   with the worst possible intentions,
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.840]   and will ask for every file,
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.200]   how did it get from Qualtrics into your paper,
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.680]   just assume that all the time,
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.680]   then that means you need to pay as much attention
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.980]   to the file that was downloaded,
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.040]   and how it was processed,
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.080]   and every part of the pipeline has to be documented.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.960]   You just have to do that.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.180]   And so, working with Crosnic's lab,
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.080]   that's the process that we adopted,
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:09.920]   and there's all kinds...
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:12.200]   People email, they're like, wait, show me this finding.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:14.000]   I'm like, okay, here's the link to the server,
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.800]   here's the syntax, you can go find it, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.920]   So, good scientists should do that,
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:24.260]   and so the possibility of scrutiny and catching fraud
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.040]   should motivate everyone to treat it
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.200]   as though it's an inevitability,
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.520]   and therefore, be careful in your process.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.040]   Convincing 19-year-old Stanford undergraduates
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.600]   that that is likely to happen,
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:38.800]   and that therefore, you need to pay super close attention
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.400]   to the details, that was my task as a lab manager.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.960]   And so, there, it was a mix of the fear
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.400]   of shame and humiliation,
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:51.200]   but also, ideally, the contribution that our work will make.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.680]   And we had the hardest working RAs
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.320]   we've ever had that summer,
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.280]   and that's not an empirical claim.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.240]   I say that, I didn't randomize the undergrads to that,
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.100]   but that experience kind of gave me the idea
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.800]   for the purpose studies,
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.600]   was assume people wanna do good work,
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.400]   but all else equal,
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.440]   they might find an easier way to do it,
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.760]   and then motivate with an appeal
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.720]   to how this work could make a difference,
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.040]   how other people could be influenced by it,
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.200]   and also, if you don't take it seriously,
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.680]   it'd be a really big deal, it'd be really bad.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.600]   And I think about that a lot,
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.520]   because we don't often appeal
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.400]   to the contribution value of the work,
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.440]   we appeal to getting a good grade and impressing people.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.800]   And that's less important for me than did I get a skill
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.160]   and did I do high-quality, high-integrity work.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.360]   - So, what you're basically saying
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.960]   is that if we attach our motivation to the give,
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.080]   to the contribution that we're going to make,
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.020]   it actually makes the process much easier,
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:53.260]   or at least more rewarding along the way,
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:56.520]   as well as, by definition,
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.160]   contributing more positively to society.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:05.940]   It's causing me to reflect on what we normally perceive
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:08.720]   as high-achieving individuals.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.480]   So often, it seems like we hear the stories
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.080]   of the Steve Jobses,
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.400]   I really enjoyed that book by Walter Isaacson,
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.720]   and that story, I'm very impressed by his contributions,
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.120]   although he's a complicated person,
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.560]   as is often the case with people
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.120]   that make big contributions, it seems.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:26.600]   Or people in the political sphere,
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.360]   or people in the academic sphere, or the sports sphere,
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.640]   you know, most often, we think of them
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.000]   as striving for themselves,
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.840]   maybe for themselves and their family.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.680]   And then there are these people that really stand out
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.800]   as these shining examples, like Martin Luther King,
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.760]   or, you know, and others where we just are kind of in awe
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:49.100]   of how mission-driven they were for the greater good.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:53.300]   - What sort of work is being done
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.020]   to encourage that kind of mindset,
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.020]   the contribution mindset?
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.640]   Growth mindset through contribution mindset.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:02.060]   I just coined that, contribution mindset.
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.380]   - Add some more words in there.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:06.220]   - Right, exactly, that's all it needs, more mindsets.
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:07.420]   But the contribution mindset,
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.520]   because I think, at least in this country,
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:13.820]   we are often raised to revere people
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.980]   that make big contributions,
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:18.780]   but then we get really absorbed into that person's story.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.260]   Right, it's like the story of the person
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:21.100]   and what made them tick.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.740]   And then there's a lot of ego in it, you know,
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:26.220]   or they have a kind of obsessive nature to them.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:29.460]   And we don't know what goes on in other people's minds.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:31.020]   You know, we're so, I must say,
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:34.620]   there's a certain arrogance in all of our perceptions
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:37.220]   of others, like that we know why they're doing
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:38.300]   what they're doing.
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.260]   Half the time, we don't even know
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.660]   why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.860]   But I think you get the idea here.
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:46.100]   What I'm imagining is a more benevolent world
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.300]   where people also enjoy striving more,
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:52.020]   and the striving process itself, while hard, has meaning,
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:54.240]   and people are not egoless,
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:56.420]   but where there's a bit more balance.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:59.500]   Like, are we getting a little bit like,
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:01.420]   we, you know, kind of looking at this
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.420]   through rose-colored glasses?
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:04.740]   Or I think it's possible.
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:05.820]   I like to think it's possible.
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:09.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that the version
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:14.100]   that in which people are purely pro-social,
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:17.060]   self-transcendent, and have no self-interest,
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:19.260]   you know, is not super realistic,
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:21.740]   and it's not actually what our data are finding.
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.300]   So what we find is that adding
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:27.300]   this pro-social contribution argument has a big effect,
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:31.020]   but if you do it absent any plausible benefit
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:34.420]   the person would get, it tends to not be motivating.
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:38.100]   So it's the combination of, let's just take the school case.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.660]   I'm gonna learn something, gain a new skill.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:44.260]   I'm gonna get a job that I enjoy and that gives me freedom,
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:47.020]   and make a contribution to others.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:49.740]   We found it was the addition of the pro-social part
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.140]   to the self-interested part.
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:54.820]   Now, if it was do X, Y, Z,
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:57.260]   and, you know, make lots of money far in the future,
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:00.020]   and then give that money away, that didn't work,
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:01.740]   'cause that's still the same logic
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.220]   of sacrifice now for later financial reward,
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.660]   which then has an exchange value
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:09.060]   of some ambiguous, you know, amount in the future.
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:11.980]   That one didn't motivate kids or students
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:14.740]   to want to deeply learn that. - Don't tell the philanthropists that.
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.580]   - Universities depend heavily on philanthropy,
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.820]   especially nowadays, and we're grateful to them
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.340]   that they support so much good work.
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:23.460]   So you're saying that it makes sense
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.660]   that there needs to be some component of self-interest,
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:29.020]   right, like Jobs loved design, right?
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:34.020]   Presumably folks like Elon and others
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:36.260]   love the mechanics of what they do,
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:38.860]   building rockets, building electric cars,
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:39.780]   and things like that.
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:41.340]   But then this pro-social thing,
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:44.780]   the idea that the world could be better and different
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:46.500]   with these things in them.
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.540]   - Yeah, if you did the work right.
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:51.740]   I mean, a good example is my friend, Danielle Kretik,
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:54.660]   who ran Empathy Lab at Google for a while,
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:58.420]   and before that worked at Apple and other places.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.740]   You know, you could think that designing products
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.700]   at a large tech company is purely about
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:04.540]   is that product gonna sell a lot,
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:05.740]   make a lot of money, et cetera,
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:07.260]   and that's obviously part of the value
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.180]   for the shareholders and so on.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.420]   But, you know, her philosophy was always,
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:14.100]   okay, well, what's gonna happen with the user?
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.060]   What does the user need?
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.380]   Is their life gonna be better with this product?
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:20.820]   And that often led to design choices
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:24.220]   that made the product even better and more profitable.
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:25.860]   And I think there are a lot of examples of that
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:30.020]   where, you know, when the team is trying
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.780]   to create something that is high quality,
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:34.220]   but with integrity and ethics
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.060]   that are gonna benefit people,
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.140]   people are willing to put in extra hours.
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:41.980]   They're willing to solve a puzzle, do better work.
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:45.140]   I think there are a lot of examples of that.
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:46.660]   That's on the product design side.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.300]   I also wanna talk about the management side.
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:50.300]   So one of the people I followed for my book
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.020]   is a manager at a company, she was at Microsoft,
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.380]   now she's at a place called ServiceNow,
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:58.380]   and I just studied how she mentored young employees.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:00.620]   Her name is Steph Okamoto,
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:03.540]   and she has this great story
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:08.540]   about a really awesome 25-ish employee,
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:11.500]   25-year-old-ish employee showed up
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.780]   and had come from teaching, Teach for America,
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.300]   and now is in HR at Microsoft.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.940]   And Steph could immediately tell, her name is Saloni,
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.860]   she's gonna be bored by her regular job.
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:26.460]   She's gonna be able to do more than what she had to do.
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:29.140]   But as a manager, you can't say as the first thing,
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:31.140]   you need to do twice your job for the same amount of pay.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:33.260]   That's like not a good management philosophy.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:34.700]   So instead, it was a conversation.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:37.380]   All right, what's a contribution you wanna make
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:40.980]   to the company, where in making that, above and beyond,
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:42.100]   you're gonna learn a new skill
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:44.900]   that's gonna help you move up the ladder, right?
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:46.940]   So that in your next performance review,
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.780]   you're gonna look like a superstar,
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:50.780]   like a total over-performer.
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:51.620]   And so at the time,
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.740]   they were running global manager development.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.140]   And so what they decided was,
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.260]   don't just deliver the programs well,
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:03.740]   which Steph thought she could do well,
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.900]   but also create a dashboard to track everyone's progress.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:08.700]   So every new hire,
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.580]   they would know where they are in the management process.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:12.580]   And it was global during the pandemic,
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:14.540]   so kind of a complicated time.
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:16.860]   Anyway, she did her regular job really well
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.220]   and created this whole dashboard,
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:21.480]   which brought value to the company, big contribution.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:24.420]   But then when it came time for performance evaluations,
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:26.100]   she could say, you're already performing
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.820]   at a level, two levels up.
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:29.740]   That gave her promotional velocity.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:31.820]   She moved up, she left the company for a while,
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:34.460]   now is the chief of staff HR at Microsoft, right?
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:37.360]   Kind of in line to lead Microsoft.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.900]   And then what about Steph?
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:42.140]   Well, Steph's team overperformed, which was incentivized.
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:44.100]   But then she gets to go home saying like,
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.180]   I use my time as a manager to change someone's life.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:49.500]   And that brings her so much joy.
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:53.860]   And it's just so much fun as a teacher
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:58.340]   to have some of our time with young people
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:01.400]   lead them on a path they wouldn't have been on otherwise.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.060]   It is a total blast to mentor someone
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.620]   and change their lives.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:07.760]   So I think that's a good example of,
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.140]   it's in everyone's long-term self-interest
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:13.500]   to contribute to both the company and the people around you.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.700]   But no one's being a martyr.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:19.340]   They're not really, also everyone's compensated.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.600]   So you need to think about, of course,
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.640]   is the company gonna pay you if you help others improve?
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.160]   And there's important questions that we asked there.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:28.340]   But I just think that's a good example
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:30.420]   where we have a false psychotomy
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.220]   of it's either good for me or I'm a martyr helping others.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.580]   But like the best work is both.
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:38.300]   And then it feels awesome
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.420]   'cause you both change people's lives
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:41.820]   and you're compensated for it.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:42.660]   And that's great.
[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:46.740]   Certainly has been my experience
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:49.060]   that doing things that I love,
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:52.660]   like learning and organizing and distributing information
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.440]   with the specific intention of people benefiting from it,
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.900]   should they choose to use it or apply it or think about it,
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.820]   is the best of both worlds.
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:04.860]   - Yeah. - Certainly.
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.820]   Let's talk about this other phenotype,
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:12.820]   the people that, and they do serve a role in the world,
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:18.520]   folks whose sole purpose seems to be to critique,
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.860]   to identify errors.
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:22.060]   And I think in the case of catching
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:26.560]   real fundamental flaws and stuff play a key role.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.400]   We need those, right?
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.560]   - Yeah, and it's kind of unfair that as a scientific field,
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.640]   we force a small group of people
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.320]   to have to police everybody else's work.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.440]   Ideally, they wouldn't have to do that job.
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.320]   And so there's a lot of value in the people
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.000]   who have developed very honest
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]   and high integrity tools to find mistakes.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.660]   - Yeah, I think some of the AI tools
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:48.560]   for finding errors, at least in data sets.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.500]   - Right, like the images in a neuroscience study
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.560]   where you can tell that the images have been altered.
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:53.640]   - Or plots. - Yeah.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.120]   - Like I remember a few years back,
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.200]   the Reinhard Schoen cases of the,
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.440]   he was like this wunderkind who published,
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.720]   I was like crazy numbers,
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:04.920]   like eight or 10 papers in science and nature per year.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.760]   And then I think it was actually similarities
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:11.000]   in the noise, the random, in quotes, noise plots.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:11.840]   - Oh, the error bars.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:15.480]   - That eventually led to the understanding
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:18.840]   that there was data duplication or something.
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.540]   Anyway, I don't remember how it went.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:21.740]   Yeah, it's important to correct
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:23.540]   the literature that way, right?
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.420]   But then there seems to be, at least online,
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:28.300]   and on social media, there seems to be
[01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:30.580]   a kind of a short-term incentive,
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:31.900]   I have to imagine there's some incentive,
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:33.780]   for people just being really critical.
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:36.080]   Like I was thinking about this the other day,
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:40.060]   what kind of mindset would one have
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:44.180]   to just randomly go put a nasty comment on social media?
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:45.100]   Like if you just think about it,
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.600]   not about an issue you're particularly vexed by
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.740]   or somebody's stance on, like that makes sense, right?
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:52.920]   People get aggravated and they're like, there they were.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.200]   But just think about the mindset there.
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:58.060]   Like, oh, you've got your life, you have time,
[01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:01.740]   and you're going to go like say mean things, right?
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:05.900]   Like to me, it's just inconceivable to do that online,
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.260]   like to go and just post that stuff.
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:09.500]   But clearly there's something,
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.820]   there's some incentive built there.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:13.220]   And I don't think this is a new thing.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.220]   I'm guessing that before we had online culture
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.800]   within medieval societies,
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:20.860]   and these elements exist within us,
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:25.520]   and that there must be some reward,
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:27.680]   they must feel some reward.
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.220]   But it's not generative, it's not building society.
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.700]   When appropriately placed, I guess we're saying,
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:36.920]   it provides a corrective mechanism.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:39.260]   But what do you think that's about?
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:42.240]   And is there any literature on this kind of thing?
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:45.160]   - Yeah, well, not the exact example
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.960]   of being a total jerk online.
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.960]   I mean, I can't imagine doing that 'cause who has the time?
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.440]   I mean, I have four kids and like coach baseball.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:01.760]   I don't know how I'm gonna like police other people,
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.240]   unless it's relevant to my work.
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:05.920]   And I think someone's like not having integrity
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.740]   in what they're doing.
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:07.980]   And I'm like, you guys are being sloppy.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:09.560]   And I might say that.
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:14.560]   But what I find compelling is a beautiful new book
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:16.800]   by Mary Murphy called "Cultures of Growth,"
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:19.880]   who was trained at Stanford under Claude Steele,
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.760]   was also trained by Carol Dweck,
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.840]   just came out a week ago,
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:26.200]   and it's getting tons of great press.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:29.600]   And in her work, what she finds is that fixed mindset
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:34.600]   can be a cultural variable, like a more leadership variable,
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.640]   not just in the mind of the individual.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.720]   And when that's the culture,
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.320]   then she finds people are more willing to try
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.080]   to make everyone else look like an idiot
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.540]   so that you don't get attacked.
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:51.720]   That's the summary finding.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:54.920]   And there's a kind of deflection strategy
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:58.760]   that if I trash other people for being idiots,
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:01.500]   then it'll make other people think twice
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.480]   before they mess with me.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:06.160]   And so, but it creates the very toxic culture
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.480]   that they're trying to escape,
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.160]   which is the threat of their own intelligence being attacked.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.920]   So it's totally counterproductive.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:15.720]   And she uses the example of Microsoft
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:17.120]   under the Ballmer era,
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.880]   where you'd go into meetings and you'd get yelled at
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:22.160]   if you made any mistake and you weren't allowed to talk,
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:25.120]   and they would literally flip over a table and yell at you,
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.080]   and people would leave the room crying.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:31.680]   And there's a lot of accounts of this
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:33.200]   as a very public information.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.560]   And one of the things Satya Nadella did when he came in
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:39.760]   was to change what he said.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:42.200]   He said, "We have a culture of know-it-alls,
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.680]   "and we need a culture of learn-it-alls."
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:48.520]   And has the virtue of ending in the same word,
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.040]   so it's pithy, but I kind of like that idea.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.200]   And so Mary describes how,
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.880]   in this culture of genius, she calls it,
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.720]   you don't just get the hypercriticism,
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.640]   you then, the consequence of that is unethical behavior
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:07.320]   where you hide mistakes or lie about things
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:10.880]   because you're worried about being outed as not a genius.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:14.240]   So the culture of fearing mistakes gives rise
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:17.520]   to the kind of unethical hiding type of culture.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:21.160]   Now, the layperson could draw a line between that
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.160]   and like the Zune and Bing and other like failed products.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.720]   You know, I'll leave that to organizational scholars
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.320]   to decide if that's the story.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.320]   But at least the cautionary tale is like Boeing
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.160]   is another example where Calhoun, when he came in as a CEO,
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.880]   changed the incentive scheme at Boeing
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.080]   to be something called stack ranking,
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:42.960]   which is where you fire the bottom 10%
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:45.760]   every six months or a year within your group.
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:50.280]   So if your group might be higher performing on average
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:51.240]   than some other group,
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.960]   but the bottom 10% of your group are getting fired.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:58.000]   Okay, and this goes back to GE, it's a Jack Welch policy.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.640]   Anyway, so that happened two years ago,
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:01.880]   and look what's happened in the last two years.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:02.720]   Now he's out, right?
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.160]   You have all these mistakes
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:08.120]   where people aren't going and finding the problems.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.400]   Now, again, I'm not at Boeing.
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:12.000]   I can't, you know, as a scientist,
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.980]   I can't say that that is the cause.
[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:16.260]   But the argument in Mary's book
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:17.760]   is that when you have organizations
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:21.280]   like that culture of genius, you hide mistakes,
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.840]   and then you have unethical behavior
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.360]   in order to conceal those, and then you don't fix them.
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.780]   But in what she calls a culture of growth,
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:33.440]   you're like willing to examine mistakes
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.040]   because they're not indicative of a sign that,
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:38.920]   they're not indicative of your overall inability to do well.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:41.880]   They're like part of the process of growing as a group.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.640]   - Super interesting.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.600]   You said Mary Murphy cultures of growth?
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.440]   - Yeah.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.260]   - Interesting.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.960]   It seems everybody worked with Carol Dweck,
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:51.200]   you, Claude Steele, Mary Murphy.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:52.680]   - I have a small friendship group.
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:54.040]   - That's an amazing group.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:55.160]   - By that, I mean I have no friends
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.460]   except people I work with.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:01.380]   - You've clearly landed in a great group, nonetheless.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.840]   This is very interesting.
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:07.120]   So people who are hypercritical
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.200]   or spend an enormous amount of time being critical
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:12.760]   just for being critical sake are masking,
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.720]   they're cloaking themselves.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:17.100]   It's a form of self-protection, yeah.
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:19.800]   - That's their SR, that's the claim.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.320]   And I think there's some pretty good
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:22.600]   suggestive evidence of that.
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:24.580]   - Yeah, it'd be interesting if online,
[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:26.480]   like everyone had to put some of their CV
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.640]   in their masthead, you know?
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:30.520]   It's sort of like what have you done as you're attacking?
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.680]   Because that would differentiate the people
[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:34.220]   like Elizabeth Bick, for instance,
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:35.260]   who I think that's her name,
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:40.260]   who's considered one of the best data evaluation people,
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:44.320]   right, she runs her Twitter account,
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:46.440]   is they essentially, she shows errors in papers.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.160]   And I think the goal there is to offer people
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.220]   the opportunity to not necessarily retract,
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:52.280]   although in some cases retract,
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:55.200]   but to alter the papers, write errata and addendums
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.400]   and things that to say, you know,
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.160]   so that's like the appropriate use of critique, right?
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:04.080]   She's not doing it to cloak anything else, presumably.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.080]   As opposed to people that just run around
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:08.360]   trying to poke holes in everything that they see.
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.320]   It's cynicism, really.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:12.000]   It's kind of an like online cynicism.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.560]   - Well, I think it's easier to be skeptical
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:18.640]   than it is to like eventually believe in something
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:20.480]   after being convinced.
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:23.640]   And so I think there's a default toward,
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:25.080]   well, I don't believe that.
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:27.960]   And we get that sometimes with growth mindset.
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:28.800]   They're like, well, what do you mean
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:30.360]   a 50 minute intervention has effect?
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:33.160]   Well, okay, but all the things you're complaining about
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:35.340]   are things that we addressed in the study.
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:38.040]   So at some point you have to just say
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:40.960]   that you believe in the process of science or you don't.
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:43.800]   And I understand if there were additional studies
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:45.360]   that didn't follow the process of science
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.840]   or left big holes to be addressed.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:49.520]   But at some point it's like, well, we did what you asked for.
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.120]   So I don't know what to tell you, I'm sorry.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.600]   - Yeah, I know the growth mindset field
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:58.120]   has come under a bit of, not attack, but critique.
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.240]   I know this 'cause in researching the solo episode
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:03.320]   and this one, one always has to be careful
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.880]   about relying on Wikipedia too much
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.960]   because it's the use of editors, legacy editors.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:09.400]   And I'll go on record saying that there's a ton of bias
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:11.160]   in even within the legacy editors.
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:12.200]   I just, by the way, I'm not,
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:13.860]   just got my page vandalized even more,
[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:15.760]   but I've sort of given up at this point
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:18.280]   because things are kludged together out of context.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:21.120]   And so I like, if I look at growth mindset on Wikipedia,
[02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:22.480]   there's a lot of supportive evidence
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:25.880]   and then you can get like two paragraphs of critique.
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:29.320]   And so for the uninformed, they don't know how to weigh that
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:31.080]   which is why we basically need a new system.
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.780]   - Well, they kind of want to say on one hand,
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:35.160]   on the other hand, but then-
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.100]   - Yeah, and there's no real weighting.
[02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:38.760]   We don't know the expertise of these people
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:40.680]   where they're gleaning from blogs or whatnot.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.280]   And look, I think it's a great concept.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:47.200]   I think that it's just, to me at least,
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.060]   it seems that there's an overwhelming amount of evidence
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.280]   that growth mindset and related mindsets
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.320]   that we've talked about today have immense value.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.000]   I think it's also good to have competing opinions
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:01.000]   in any field, but I think as we're kind of parsing
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.480]   motivation for people that really want to make it,
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:09.900]   I don't know, feel their best, do their best,
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:11.600]   make a contribution to the world.
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:14.000]   It seems like the default state that the fast food,
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.840]   the junk food, the Slurpee, the Twizzlers
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:19.840]   and the Snickers bar there, I just got myself
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:21.720]   in more trouble by naming name brands.
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:26.720]   The junk food is in hiding by critiquing.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:33.560]   There's, I think, maybe there's the man in the arena thing,
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:36.320]   that it's easy to be a spectator.
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:38.920]   It's hard to try and do something real.
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:41.640]   - Yeah, I think that going back to this question of like,
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:44.240]   are you willing to reveal your mistakes or not?
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:48.480]   Mary writes a lot about great exemplars in her book,
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:52.160]   Jennifer Doudna, who's developed CRISPR,
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:55.400]   famously has a lab that's hypercritical in the lab,
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:58.560]   but then the work stands well in public.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:01.920]   And it's someone who could have every incentive
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:04.400]   to just churn out as many papers as possible
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.080]   and for profit, et cetera.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:08.240]   But instead, and I've actually interviewed
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.660]   one of the postdocs from that lab,
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:12.420]   and it's just like an amazing scientific enterprise,
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:16.120]   that I write about this astrophysics lab at Vanderbilt
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:23.120]   with a guy named Kayvon Stassen, who is just a legend.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.520]   He is, as you know, a lot of people would be thrilled
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.480]   to have one nature paper in their lives,
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.560]   like he had five last year, right?
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:35.560]   But what he does is mentor
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:38.360]   probably the most diverse group of physicists
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.200]   in all of America.
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.860]   And he developed what are called bridge programs,
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:45.480]   where students, often graduate students of color,
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.560]   students who had low GRE scores, low socioeconomic status,
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:52.680]   they're pre-admitted to a master's program in physics
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.080]   at a local HBCU, Historically Black College University.
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:57.160]   And then if they do well,
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:00.320]   then they're pre-admitted to the physics PhD program.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.520]   And it's a now well-known idea,
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.520]   but the basic concept is in the old days,
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.320]   you look at just your GRE scores and say,
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:11.160]   are you smart enough to be a physicist or not?
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.440]   And what he argued was that the coin of the realm
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:16.480]   for professional physics is publishing professional physics.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:19.040]   And if you come into a lab and you can analyze data
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.280]   and write a paper and publish it in a journal,
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.720]   then you're a physicist.
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:24.560]   So he has people come for two years,
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:26.080]   regardless of your GREs,
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:28.360]   but as long as you have kind of grit and resilience
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:31.640]   and a drive, as you're saying, and let's them work in labs.
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.920]   And it turns out about 85% of students
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.680]   end up getting admitted to the PhD program,
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.360]   and then they do well.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:41.160]   So the first ever black first author
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.400]   on a nature paper in physics is his student, right?
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:46.240]   So like a ridiculously high proportion
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:47.840]   of racial diversity at NASA
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.920]   are graduates of his program, his laboratory, right?
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:52.160]   - And his lab is at Vanderbilt?
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.280]   - His lab's at Vanderbilt.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.160]   It's called the Vanderbilt-Fisk Graduate Program,
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:10:59.480]   interesting bridge program.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.880]   At any rate, for my book, I interviewed him
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:04.160]   and I was like, well, that's your admission.
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.360]   So what happens, there's still five years
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.520]   when people have to learn to be a physicist.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:10.840]   And every day they have a different thing they do.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:13.640]   So Monday's a journal club, Tuesday's a coffee,
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:18.160]   but the lifeblood of the lab is Wednesday's lab meetings,
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:20.040]   where you, as a trainee,
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:22.840]   put up your figures in your paper in Overleaf,
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.680]   which is like a WYSIWYG editor for scientific papers,
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:29.760]   and everyone critiques your stats, your tables,
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.840]   your figures, your narrative,
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:33.760]   and everyone's just looking at your work and critiquing it.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:36.160]   And these are all top physicists in the lab.
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:39.560]   And that sounds terrifying, and it kind of is initially,
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:42.240]   but then by the time they present at the conference,
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:44.000]   they've heard everything.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.760]   And they're doing that far before
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.840]   they're spending three months doubting themselves,
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.000]   unable to complete the paper, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.040]   It's like, you just have to do that.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.680]   You have to face that fear.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.040]   So it's very demanding, but it's super supportive.
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:00.400]   And they don't pull punches
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.360]   in terms of the critique of the content,
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:05.480]   but it's never in question
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:07.760]   whether the comments are coming from a place
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:11.440]   of believing your potential to be a great physicist.
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:13.920]   And what I like about that is that you're not like,
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:15.600]   it doesn't feel good at that time
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.920]   to be critiqued publicly, but it feels necessary.
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.720]   And you kind of know that you will measure up
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:24.840]   at the end of that process and that it's formative.
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:27.600]   I think that's fundamentally what a lot of people,
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.320]   I think, misunderstand about what it takes
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:30.840]   to help someone become better.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:34.360]   They think either I have to be a monster to critique you,
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.360]   or I just have to pull my punches.
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:38.560]   But you can be like Stassen's lab
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.400]   and be super demanding and super supportive,
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:42.120]   and then people grow.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:43.880]   - Sounds like the key thing is to make sure
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.880]   that one is gleaning critique from the correct sources.
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:51.160]   And this is one of the major issues
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.160]   with kind of just open online critique.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:57.800]   While attractive because of the lack of barriers,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:02.800]   it means that you have to be a selective filter, right?
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:06.240]   I mean, you can see this in online comments.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:09.300]   People, some people are very impacted by them.
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:10.140]   And then other people say,
[02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:11.880]   "Oh yeah, well, that's some person in a basement."
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:14.080]   Or that's a, you know, like, "What have they done?"
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:15.640]   And, you know, but some people just have
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:17.800]   a thinner skin than others.
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:21.320]   And, but when you're in a community
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.500]   where clearly everyone cares about the mission,
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:25.380]   the outcome, the physics, et cetera,
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:30.360]   then you can put trust in the critique.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.720]   By the way, I find it really interesting
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.440]   that this lab at Vanderbilt is focused mainly
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:38.920]   on motivation and drive as the key thing,
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:42.680]   as opposed to some standardized score metric
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.040]   or something or prior experience.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:47.520]   When I was starting my lab as a junior professor
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:50.120]   back before being at Stanford at UCSD,
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:52.480]   UC San Diego, a senior colleague of mine said,
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:53.960]   "When picking students,
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:59.920]   "you have to really evaluate many things, right?
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.760]   "Ethics, how they do the work, et cetera."
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:05.760]   But the main thing is just drive.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.600]   Are they driven?
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:07.440]   - Yeah.
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.080]   - And yeah, that turned out to be the case.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.000]   - Yeah, I think it's hard.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.440]   I mean, it's just a case by case decision.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:16.480]   You know, like you don't pick that many students
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:19.240]   over your career, so you don't get to really learn.
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:21.920]   But I think, I had a colleague when I started
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:26.920]   who was like, just told me they just sort by GRE right away.
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:28.440]   - Just by standardized score.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:29.280]   - By standardized test score.
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:30.880]   I was like, "Well, I would never do that."
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.440]   He's like, "How about this?
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:35.600]   "How about you take all the low GRE students
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:36.600]   "and I take all the high ones
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:38.400]   "and see whose students do better?"
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:41.680]   - Yeah, I feel like standardized tests in some cases
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.480]   are necessary but not sufficient.
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:44.320]   - Yeah.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.080]   - That there's this other thing that's like nuance
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:49.320]   and I mean, coming up with great experimental ideas
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:51.160]   or I mean, there's just so many examples of people
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.760]   that just weren't good at standardized tests
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:55.560]   that just kicked ass in their various fields.
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:56.400]   - Yeah.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.000]   - But there is a correlation there, typically.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000]   - I mean, I think my issue, in a perfect world,
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.400]   standardized test scores would be great for equity
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.840]   because there would be people
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.000]   who didn't get great information in high school
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.600]   about where to go to college
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:12.720]   or started out in the wrong major
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:15.040]   and eventually figured out, don't have great GPAs
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.560]   or didn't go to a great college
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.400]   but they have tremendous ability and they deserve a shot.
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.960]   And so I think that argument for GREs makes a ton of sense.
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.120]   The problem is that you can just pay
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:28.960]   to have someone teach you how to take the GRE
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:31.280]   and your scores can go up a huge percentage.
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.400]   And so the GREs end up being a proxy
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.640]   either for the training you got now
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:39.000]   or it's a proxy for how good
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.280]   your 10th grade math teacher was
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:42.800]   'cause it's mostly testing 10th grade geometry.
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:44.600]   And so again, that's gonna be a function
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:45.640]   of what neighborhood you grew up in
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:47.480]   and how good your high school teachers were.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.680]   So what I don't love is like,
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:53.160]   I would love test scores if they were about
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.360]   meritocracy and equality or opportunity
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.320]   but they often end up being just a proxy
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.280]   for kind of advantages you already had.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:05.400]   So ultimately though for Kavon,
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:11.560]   setting aside the GRE in physics was like a hypothesis.
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:15.600]   Ultimately the proof that needed to be in the pudding was,
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:18.000]   did the students admitted under an alternative means
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.160]   end up producing great physics?
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:23.240]   And in that case, the answer is absolutely yes.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.280]   And so for me, it's like, yes, consider it or not.
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:27.280]   For admissions,
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:29.400]   but what are you doing with the students when they arrive?
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:31.520]   How are you mentoring and how are you training?
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.880]   And how are you breaking the link
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:36.040]   between whatever advantages might've had in the past
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:37.680]   and the work that they can do in the future
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:39.040]   if they're driven?
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:44.440]   - We've been talking a lot about data and other people.
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:47.320]   I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you a little bit about you.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:48.280]   - Sure.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:50.880]   - No pressure to share anything you don't wanna share,
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:54.160]   but of all the things you could study,
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:55.580]   of all the contributions you could make,
[02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:58.760]   you decided to focus on this notion of mindsets
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.520]   and essentially trying to figure out
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:04.640]   how people can be their best
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.160]   for the greatest good of the world.
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:09.260]   This would be the way I would describe it.
[02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:12.840]   Is that just inherent in your wiring
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:15.380]   or was there something about your experience coming up
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:18.240]   that makes you value that in particular?
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.240]   Or did you happen to just resonate with Carol and folks
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.900]   and feel like, "Hey, this would be a great place
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:27.860]   "to place my efforts?"
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:30.340]   - Yeah, well, that's an impossible question to answer
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:32.500]   'cause I have no counterfactuals.
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:35.060]   So a real causal inference person wouldn't allow me.
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:42.020]   This is a digression, but so my only real precocious skill
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:43.940]   is that I can do the splits,
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:45.100]   which sounds like a weird thing to do,
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:47.660]   but it's my party trick at weddings.
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:49.260]   - You always could?
[02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.140]   Or you did gymnastics as a kid?
[02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:54.300]   - I did, but not seriously, not for very long.
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:57.600]   And one time someone, another academic,
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:17:59.160]   he was like, "You can do the splits, that's super weird."
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:00.660]   I'm like, "Yes, it is weird."
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:03.360]   And he was like, "How can you do that?"
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:05.060]   I was like, "Well, as a kid, I was in gymnastics
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:07.040]   "and then I stretched all the time."
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:10.600]   And he was like, "That is the dumbest causal story
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:11.600]   "I've ever heard in my life.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:13.140]   "There's no way that that is the single,
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:15.520]   "even the most important cause."
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.160]   And I think about that as like,
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:20.760]   my whole life I've been posed with this puzzle
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:22.920]   of why can I do this weird thing?
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:24.120]   And I had told myself that.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.980]   And I don't think that's even remotely true.
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:27.360]   I think that's for whatever reason,
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:28.680]   it's just kind of developed.
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:30.200]   So I can't fully answer your question
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:33.740]   about why I got super interested in this work.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:37.520]   But I will say that out of college,
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:39.760]   I thought I was gonna be a lawyer.
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:42.160]   And that's because my college major
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.480]   was something called the Program of Liberal Studies,
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.560]   which is a great books major
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:48.960]   where you read the great works of history and philosophy
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:49.880]   and stuff. - Amazing.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:51.800]   - Yeah, and then you read them in order.
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:54.840]   And so, and there's no lectures allowed.
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:57.200]   And you can't even read the introduction to the book.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.040]   So you just have to like read Hume
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:00.800]   and pretend like you can understand it
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.180]   and Kant and stuff like that.
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:04.120]   And you argue with other 19 year olds
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:05.580]   about what it might mean.
[02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:08.500]   And I loved it, it was great.
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:10.360]   I still don't know what Kant was talking about,
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:12.520]   but I'll figure that out at some point.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:16.640]   But then PLS, the joke is probably law school,
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:17.880]   which is the answer to the question of
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:20.920]   what are you gonna do with this liberal arts major?
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:22.720]   And so I thought that's what I'll do.
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:25.960]   But at the last second, I just had a change of heart.
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:28.980]   And so I went and taught in a really low income school
[02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:30.800]   in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:34.280]   And I ended up being the six through eight English teacher,
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:36.080]   the K through eight basketball coach.
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.800]   I coached, or K through eight PE coach,
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:41.760]   and then I coached basketball and ran the book club.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.860]   And I like ran the cat five cables
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:47.560]   to fix the internet in the attic, you know.
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:48.840]   And it was great.
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:50.200]   I worked like 100 hours a week.
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:52.120]   I made $12,000 a year.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:53.920]   It's a lot of fun, had a great time.
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:56.000]   And at the end of it, I thought,
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.520]   now I'm gonna go to law school.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:00.340]   And when I was doing my applications,
[02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:04.120]   a friend of mine died of cancer.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:04.940]   They got sarcoma.
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:06.960]   It was real quick, it was like six months.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:10.640]   And we all went back to college
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:13.040]   and were there for a service.
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.960]   And I remember being in the airport
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:20.480]   and I picked up Jeffrey Sachs' "End of Poverty,"
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:22.840]   which is a popular book at the time.
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:25.360]   And just thinking like, here's a guy who like,
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.960]   I don't know, was doing something pretty mundane,
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:30.040]   macroeconomics, but he was spending all his time
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:33.400]   talking world leaders in other countries
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.520]   out of crushing debt that was causing poverty.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:39.400]   And it's like taking whatever precocious skill he had
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:41.440]   and using it for others.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:45.200]   And I thought, law's not my Jeff Sachs skill.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:48.640]   What I do know how to do is motivate teenagers.
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:50.840]   Like that's how I spend all my time.
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:52.920]   And so I thought I just wanna do,
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:55.640]   I wanna do the science of motivating young people
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.480]   like as much as possible.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:58.440]   So then I went to Stanford.
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:01.520]   I'd never taken stats before, never taken psychology,
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:05.080]   but I just like tried to become like a wild man
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.760]   learning as much as I could.
[02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:08.420]   And thankfully in my third year,
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:10.360]   Carol started working with me
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:13.560]   and like, and we kind of haven't looked back since.
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.080]   - What an awesome story.
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:17.920]   So totally mission-driven and-
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:19.280]   - And post-hoc causal inference.
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.840]   So who knows if that's actually the story,
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:23.160]   but those sequence of events did occur though.
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:24.560]   - Post-hoc causal inference.
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:27.360]   I guess you can map onto that famous Steve Jobs
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:28.640]   commencement speech at Stanford
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:31.680]   where he's basically saying you can't connect the dots
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:33.080]   going forward only backwards.
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:34.600]   So it all makes sense looking back.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:35.440]   - Exactly.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:37.200]   - This led to that, led to this, led to that.
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:40.000]   But going forward, we're kind of stumbling in the dark.
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:46.420]   - Well, I must say I and everyone else's are so grateful
[02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:49.620]   that you made that choice or those choices.
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:53.400]   Clearly the work you're doing is having a huge impact.
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:55.700]   I covered a few of your papers on the solo episode
[02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:58.480]   on growth mindset and you mentioned nature
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:02.360]   and the fact that most people don't publish there at all,
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.720]   let alone once or twice or several times in their career.
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:06.040]   You've had an amazing run lately
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.500]   and you just had this incredible arc of papers
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:14.080]   in this area of which can be distilled down to, I think,
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:16.840]   forgive me if this doesn't capture it all,
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:21.840]   but figuring out how people can be the best version
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:25.920]   of themselves for their own lives and for the world, right?
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:27.960]   I mean, that's essentially what we're talking about here.
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:29.940]   And I love the way you incorporate the neuroscience
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:32.160]   and the motivation literature
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:34.440]   and you're so good at attribution
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:37.840]   as something that we should all model ourselves around.
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:40.200]   It's really an incredible literature
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:43.960]   and I'm excited to read the book, 10 to 25.
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:45.040]   Genuinely excited.
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:47.200]   This notion of a mentor mindset
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.240]   and how we can bring out the best in ourselves and others.
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:53.260]   It's phenomenal that you're doing this work.
[02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:54.400]   Please keep going.
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:57.960]   And I'm speaking on behalf of myself and everyone else.
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.640]   I say, thanks for taking time
[02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:01.760]   out of your busy research schedule and teaching schedule
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.360]   to come here and teach millions of people
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:06.880]   about what you do and what they can do to be their best.
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.440]   So thank you so much.
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:09.280]   - Well, thanks.
[02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:12.820]   Well, we're just getting started and it was great to be here.
[02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:15.720]   I did, I missed baseball practice tonight.
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:18.480]   So not for me, but for nine-year-olds.
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:20.800]   - An apology to your nine-year-olds, plural?
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:21.620]   - Yeah.
[02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:22.460]   - Okay.
[02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:23.840]   Oh, 'cause there are many of them on the team.
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:24.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:25.500]   - Oh, okay.
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:26.340]   This is back in Austin.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.160]   - Yeah.
[02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:28.000]   - Okay.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.200]   When's the next game?
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:30.920]   - A couple, three or four weeks.
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:32.320]   So we have plenty of time.
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:33.580]   We're still learning how to throw and hit.
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:34.420]   We'll get there.
[02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:35.680]   - Well, depending on when this episode comes out,
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:38.080]   you can let me know if they won or lost and-
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:38.920]   - Doesn't matter. - My apologies to the team.
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:39.740]   - It's about the process.
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:40.580]   - That's right.
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:43.000]   That game is important.
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.760]   But I can assure you that the information
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:50.000]   that you've given us today is sure to make a huge difference
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:50.820]   in people's lives.
[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:51.840]   So thank you so much.
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:53.280]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.200]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:37.960]   I do read all the comments.
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:39.440]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.920]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:43.520]   we discuss supplements.
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:45.740]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:47.680]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:49.280]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.040]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:52.600]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:54.160]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.280]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:59.240]   so that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:01.260]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:03.840]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.680]   So that's Instagram, X, Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:08.840]   And on all those platforms,
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:11.200]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.720]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:14.200]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:16.160]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:17.600]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:20.720]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:21.880]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:23.820]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:24.960]   the Neural Network newsletter
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:26.840]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:28.560]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.480]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:32.240]   one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:34.280]   for things like how to optimize your sleep,
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:36.100]   how to optimize your dopamine,
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:37.360]   deliberate cold exposure.
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:39.600]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:42.200]   and a protocol for neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.320]   and a lot more,
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:45.720]   all of which, again, is completely zero cost to access.
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:47.340]   You simply go to Huberman Lab,
[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:48.520]   go to the Menu tab,
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:49.600]   scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:50.800]   and provide your email.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:53.000]   And we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.320]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:56.800]   for today's discussion all about growth mindset
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.760]   and the stress can be performance-enhancing mindset
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:01.280]   with Dr. David Yeager.
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:03.520]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:05.460]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:08.040]   (upbeat music)
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:10.620]   (upbeat music)
