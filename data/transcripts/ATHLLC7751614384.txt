[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.880]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.480]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.360]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.720]   and one of the areas I love optimizing the most
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.040]   is my travel.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.940]   So today we're gonna talk about everything you need to know
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.120]   for a trip to France,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.840]   the world's most popular tourist destination.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.540]   We'll dig into some of the unique off the beaten path spots,
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.440]   talk about how to have lunch like a local,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.680]   and we'll run through all the top regions to visit
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.540]   with a deep dive on Paris.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.360]   I've been to France about five times,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.600]   but I couldn't think of a better guest to join me
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.200]   than Lindsay Tramuta, who's been living there since 2006.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.800]   She's a culture and travel journalist
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.360]   who's written for the New York Times, Eater, Food & Wine,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.460]   CondÃ© Nast Traveler, and a lot more.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.440]   She's also written a bunch of books about Paris,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.500]   The New Paris, The New Parisienne,
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.920]   including a restaurant guide,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.200]   and even has her own podcast called The New Paris Podcast.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.360]   So whether you're thinking about your first trip to France
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.200]   or you already know you'll be going back,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.000]   I think you'll love this episode.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.200]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.500]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.000]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.040]   in your situation,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.640]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.900]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.760]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.920]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.000]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.440]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.840]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.800]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.240]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.600]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.320]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.120]   are first generation wealth,
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.200]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.340]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.680]   and learn from each other
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.280]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.560]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.900]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.320]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.480]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.440]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.360]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.720]   to your children's education,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.040]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.480]   So many of these conversations
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.700]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.220]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.400]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.480]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.080]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.160]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.960]   Lindsey, thank you for being here.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.200]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.240]   I am excited.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   France is one of the most popular, not one,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.520]   it is the most popular tourist destination in the world.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.160]   I expect most people listening have either been,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.940]   considered going, or even have a trip on the horizon.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.920]   So I'm gonna start us off.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.880]   I have two questions for you.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.680]   One, why do you think France is number one?
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   And what do you think the 100 million people
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.360]   who come each year might be missing when they go?
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.120]   That's a very good starter question.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.560]   I think the sort of enduring popularity
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.460]   has to do with the way France continues
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.780]   to enter popular culture.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.840]   So whether it's through books, through film,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.880]   through television shows, I mean,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.220]   generations of this sort of myth-making
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.160]   and fantasy building about France as a destination
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.980]   really goes far deeper than a lot of other cultures.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.760]   Also, you have to remember the long relationship
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.840]   between the US, obviously France is a global destination,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.240]   but when we think about how much it appeals
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.120]   to Americans in particular,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.760]   that relates to the long history between the two countries.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.600]   And essentially France was one of America's first allies.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   And so I think all of that combined
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   creates a sort of attachment and a fantasy
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.380]   for people even who might be armchair travelers,
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.920]   but who know that the one day that they do get on the road
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.040]   and are able to come to Europe,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.180]   this is probably gonna be one of the first places they come.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.640]   And I would say Italy probably has some of this appeal
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.720]   as well because of the way, especially the Italian diaspora
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.120]   having such reach around the world.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.200]   But actually the one thing I did come across
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.120]   in some of the research I've done over the years
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   is that because France doesn't have
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.920]   a huge immigrant community in the United States,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.400]   for example, there's a bit more mystery involved.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.440]   And so I think that plays a role as well.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.520]   There's a sort of mystery for the average person as to,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.320]   well, what is France really like?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.560]   We've seen the films, we've heard the stories,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.760]   but what is it really like?
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.660]   And I think that is a compelling draw.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.160]   As for what people are missing,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.020]   really if you're focused entirely on a bucket list,
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.840]   that's already, I think, gonna lead you down a direction
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.000]   of being potentially disappointed.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.480]   I mean, I think the kind of version of travel
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.040]   that I like to promote and that I engage in myself
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.360]   is really trying to see some of the historic things,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.640]   but then quickly add in whatever a local might do.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.960]   And I know that sounds sort of like,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.580]   yeah, how local can you really get?
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.160]   But I think if you're researching your trip
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.520]   in the right places and listening to the right people,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.360]   you'll get that more local experience
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.240]   because ultimately I wanna know where the people
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.360]   who are like me in Paris go when they're in Rome
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.280]   or Sydney or Tokyo.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.820]   From my interactions with people who have traveled heavily,
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.600]   if you try to do too much also on a first trip
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.440]   or on any trip to Paris or to the rest of France,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.120]   I think you'll get easily overwhelmed
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.800]   and then kind of bogged down by all of the things you saw
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.380]   and almost incapable of remembering
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.800]   sort of what the highlights were.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.320]   So I think it's about going slower
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.360]   and figuring out what the perfect blend is
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   between sort of marquee sites and landmarks and experiences
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.120]   and then those that are maybe a little bit less expected
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.680]   and more atypical.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.520]   - I love that.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.800]   I've actually gotten, I think, more feedback from listeners
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   that the thing they want,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.080]   and we were connected by Brandon Presser,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.040]   who I've had two episodes with,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.440]   and we actually talked about planning a trip.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.320]   So you don't know this yet, I'm springing this on you,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.020]   but it's like every time we do one of these episodes,
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.960]   I was like, what if after we actually organize
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.240]   an amazing trip together for people in the community
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.600]   to potentially go to this place
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.920]   and do some of these things?
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.720]   And the feedback I got was that everyone loved the idea
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.160]   of traveling/feeling like a local experience.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.760]   That is the thing that I think this audience resonates with.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.600]   So I'm so glad you're here because you value that greatly.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.440]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.640]   And I see the travelers who are sort of like,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.320]   oh yeah, even the way they frame the conversation
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.360]   around what they've done, it's we did this city,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   we did that museum.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.360]   It's like, are you doing what?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   I mean, like, are you just checking it off a list
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.680]   or are you experiencing it?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   And so I think those words are very important too,
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   the way we sort of dismiss like,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.560]   yeah, been there, done that.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.240]   I think that's a very reductive way of looking at traveling
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.920]   to any kind of destination.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.640]   - So we're gonna get into a lot of that stuff.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.680]   And I'm very excited.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.520]   But first off, for people who haven't experienced France,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.120]   whether that means they've never been
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.640]   or whether they did the kind of thing,
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.000]   which I'm certainly guilty of early in my life of,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.600]   let's go to a city, let's try to do it in two days.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   Let's go to the like top five sites.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.640]   I've had that trip.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.920]   I don't love that trip anymore,
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.360]   but I've certainly been there.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.080]   So maybe give some highlights.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.000]   What do you think makes a trip to France so much different
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.240]   than other places in the world?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.000]   Whether it's people or food or culture,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.440]   like get people a little bit whet their appetite
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.280]   for where we're gonna go with this conversation.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.080]   - What I think is even astounding to me
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.040]   as someone who's lived here for 16 years
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.040]   is how each region really feels so different.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.160]   So yes, you're in the same country.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.200]   There's a semblance of shared values, of course,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.240]   across the country.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.160]   But beyond that, geographically, gastronomically,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.920]   in so many other ways, culturally,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.640]   each region really feels like it could be
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   almost its own country.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.720]   But the great thing is that it is so easy
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.240]   to get around here through trains.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.320]   Most of everything you wanna see and do
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.360]   can be accessed either by train or by a quick flight.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.040]   And that's kind of a huge gift.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.160]   Obviously, you're in the US.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.520]   I grew up in the US and everything is such an ordeal.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   It's such an expense.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   It takes ages to get most places.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.680]   And then once you're there,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.160]   you kind of are also like,
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.720]   I gotta maximize my time here.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.360]   And I think the ability to engage in like much slower travel
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.080]   is all the more possible here.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.800]   So I would say one of the compelling reasons, I think,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.520]   or one of the gifts of France really,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.800]   is that you can start in the north
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.640]   and go east, west, or straight to the south,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.040]   and every experience you have
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.480]   is going to feel slightly different
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.000]   because they're really their own little mini cultures
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and microcultures.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.360]   And so that's why one of the things
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.160]   that sort of occurred to me through COVID
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.440]   when I couldn't go very far
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.200]   was just how lucky I was to have all of this on my doorstep.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.480]   And in that case, I was taking less trains,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.880]   but I would get in the car with my husband
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   and we would go on more road trips.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.960]   And I think if you're someone who also likes
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.520]   the idea of renting a car and driving across France,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.000]   that's also possible.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.840]   To give you an example,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.480]   my husband just went on a rock climbing trip.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.400]   He's away right now and drove six hours,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.000]   arrives and he's already got in a session last night
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.640]   after a six hour car ride.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.440]   And I mean, obviously the size of the country
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   allows you to do that,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.840]   but whether you live here or you're just visiting,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   that is something that means
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.760]   you can actually do quite a lot
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.960]   and have very different experiences in one trip.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.000]   - The one new parable I adhere to on any trip
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.160]   is travel like you're coming back for sure.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.120]   Because I feel like early on my idea was,
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.520]   gosh, there's so many places in the world to go to.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.800]   Every time I go somewhere,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.560]   I have to act as if I'm never coming back.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.760]   I literally 180'd my perspective
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.640]   of make sure I do everything,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   cram it all in 'cause I might not be back
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.200]   to let's just assume I'm absolutely coming back
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.560]   and have a good experience.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.240]   - I think that's the right mindset.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.800]   - And culture is an interesting one
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.080]   because I think it's not something
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.040]   that easily fits on a checklist,
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.920]   but it's something that when you really experience it,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.840]   it's so memorable.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.080]   So I had a conversation with Rolf Potts
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   who wrote a book called "Vagabonding"
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.000]   and I can't remember if this was in the pre-talk
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.840]   or in the episode,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.200]   but he said he was talking to someone who went to France
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.120]   and was so frustrated that all they wanted to do
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.440]   was they wanted to experience the culture of France.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.680]   And they went to a cafe and they sat out on the sidewalk,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.800]   people were walking by and two hours later,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.080]   they still hadn't been able to eat and get their bill.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.280]   And they were so frustrated because all they wanted to do
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.640]   was leave the cafe to go experience the culture of France.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.480]   And he's like, "You just missed it."
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.360]   Like sitting at a cafe,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.080]   taking two hours to eat your lunch
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.120]   is literally experiencing the culture of this country,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.800]   yet you were so focused on trying to go do things.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.320]   So my new thing is relax, slow down,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.840]   experience what's there, don't plan too much.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.440]   - When you're racing to get to the next,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.000]   I don't know, museum visit or food tour or whatever,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.840]   that's when you miss some of the most memorable moments
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.760]   also because of the people you're gonna be exposed to,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.520]   whether it's the person sitting at the table next to you
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.200]   or the strangers walking by.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.480]   And also France has the idea of the flaneur,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.720]   so someone who strolls aimlessly,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.040]   really with no destination.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.520]   And it's strolling is almost an inadequate word
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.240]   for the idea because it truly means
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.440]   that you are at one with the sidewalk,
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.320]   with the city, with the natural motion of the city.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.160]   You're seeing things you don't usually see,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.560]   whether it's like the guy managing the Ferris wheel
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.440]   in one of the parks to someone selling chestnuts
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   at the Metro exit, your eyes are open.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.960]   And because you're not trying to get anywhere,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   you're seeing the city, your place or wherever
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.320]   in a way you don't usually see it.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.360]   So this idea of the flaneur is something
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.800]   that I think is naturally appealing to travelers
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.320]   if they're prepared to sort of set the bucket list aside,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.400]   set the checklist aside and just be.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.920]   And so if it means you miss one of the museums,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.240]   like you'll be fine.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.920]   I think you'll still get a good sense
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.720]   of both what this place is and how rich it is.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.080]   - Okay, so here's what I thought.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.520]   Let's talk high level first,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.480]   just about generally structuring a trip
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.920]   because it's a big country.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.360]   If someone has limited time, they can't do everything.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.680]   And let's talk after that a little bit
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.000]   about the culture of the people
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   and then dive into some specific places.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   So high level, someone's thinking, I wanna go to France.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.840]   Let's just talk about when to come the different seasons.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.800]   And I'm sure there's an argument for all of them.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.680]   So what kind of experiences you'd have
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.240]   and maybe how long you need and we'll go from there.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.800]   - I mean, obviously anybody who has two weeks
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.160]   to spend in France, that's kind of ideal.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.840]   But I know people who are able to still go slowly,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.400]   but have a week or five to seven days
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.000]   and visit a couple of places.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.800]   Obviously it's slightly more challenging
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.920]   and invariably they wish they had spent more time,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.600]   but whatever, if you don't have two weeks, that's fine.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.440]   I would say the period of the year
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.840]   is actually more important
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.360]   than necessarily the duration of time.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.160]   The summer is getting increasingly more expensive
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.120]   for one, it's also extremely hot and dry.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.680]   I mean, France is a victim of climate change
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.960]   just like every destination.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.720]   But what we're seeing now is increasing periods of drought.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.240]   So last summer I was traveling in the Louberon
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.560]   which is inland in Provence
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.000]   and there were serious forest fires all over the region.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.720]   And that continued well throughout the summer.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.000]   So there are things that change
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.240]   in what you can and can't do,
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.080]   obviously when you're in those parts of France
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.560]   when that's happening.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.400]   But that also means that the probability
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   of encountering a heat wave when you're here
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.040]   during the summer is increasing.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.440]   And that's even true in Paris.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.000]   To be frank, like last summer was extremely hot,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.600]   a series of days going well over,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.480]   I guess about 40 degrees centigrade as well,
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.200]   like over a hundred degrees
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.840]   or almost a hundred degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.440]   And when you don't have a lot of AC,
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.360]   like you feel that in a really significant way.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.640]   So summer for me is not the ideal time to come.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.400]   If that's the only period of time you have,
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.960]   then I would maybe guide you toward cooler locations
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.600]   in France, like the Western coast where Brittany is,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.320]   potentially Northern parts of France or Alsace.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.280]   But even there they can get extremely,
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.240]   have a series of days that are extremely hot.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.480]   Spring, I'm sitting in Paris right now.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.920]   We are May 18th and the weather has been erratic,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.520]   not very warm, very rainy since March.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.960]   And every year is a bit different.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.000]   So really we can't speak of sort of like any kind of trend
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.320]   for spring anymore.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.280]   But the period of the year that seems to be
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.880]   the most reliable is like September, October.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.720]   So if you're able to sort of wait out
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.920]   the summer travel period
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.840]   and go when most people are back to work,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.960]   then you'll have sort of like
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.080]   the best of the country to yourself.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.280]   And that's true even in big cities where yes,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.760]   things are back into action,
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.000]   but you've got restaurants that are all back open
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.360]   from their summer holiday.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.720]   You have all the new sort of museum exhibits
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.120]   and gallery openings and cultural events happening.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.080]   And so it's kind of a sweet spot.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.920]   Christmas too is actually a really lovely time
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.360]   because a lot of locals are gonna be with their families
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.760]   wherever you're traveling,
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.040]   but business really keeps going
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.400]   between Christmas and New Year's.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.040]   So I'd say the worst time of the year,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.840]   I think to be in France is New Year's day
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.240]   because literally nothing is open.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.880]   And I think even if you're in a hotel,
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.800]   you might even have the restaurant,
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.360]   in-house restaurant that's closed.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.400]   But aside from that,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.080]   the fall is a really great time to come.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.640]   So my advice is really,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.400]   whether you have five days or two weeks,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.840]   the more important question is, when can you come?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.240]   - I think I've done five trips
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.800]   and I haven't had a bad trip yet.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.880]   Obviously I kept coming back.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.720]   Most recently was last December we came
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.200]   and we had that Christmas experience.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.760]   We went to the Christmas markets.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.880]   It's just wonderful.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.560]   Like, I don't think there's a bad time,
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.120]   but I think there is a better time.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.000]   - Yes, that's a very optimistic way of looking at it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.640]   - And let's talk generally about the regions.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.080]   I think people know Paris,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   whether they've been there or not.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.760]   They've obviously seen it in the movies.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.200]   I think I've done a disservice to the country of France
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.560]   by spending too much of my travels to Paris
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.000]   and then some in the South.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.040]   But even I feel like I need a little bit of an education
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.400]   on high level.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.040]   What are the kinds of regions of places
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.920]   people might want to consider going to outside of Paris?
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.080]   - Well, you have the Loire Valley,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.080]   which is very green, very fairytale-esque,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.320]   known for its chateau,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.040]   known for its incredible diversity of wines.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.680]   Also, if you're someone who happens to be interested
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.560]   in natural wine,
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.000]   it was sort of like the birthplace
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.160]   of natural wine in France.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.920]   So there are a lot of very interesting producers.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.120]   You have Burgundy,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.240]   which is sort of the next great spot to be right now,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.080]   especially if you like wine.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   There's a whole wine route that you can take
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   that really leads you through sort of
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.680]   the key winemaking towns in Burgundy.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.600]   Then you have Alsace,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.120]   which is on the border with Germany,
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.960]   and Strasbourg is the key city there.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.000]   And it's very picturesque.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.080]   It's really lovely.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.640]   Christmas is a particularly,
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.760]   like the end of your holidays.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's almost a spectacle.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.000]   - It's amazing.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.360]   I forgot that I had been there until you just said that.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.480]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, we went there for the holidays."
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   It's so charming.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.000]   My wife's like, "Can we go back?"
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.960]   - Charming is the word.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.840]   And Paris, honestly,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.680]   when you compare the Paris way of celebrating
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.280]   the end of year to what happens in Strasbourg,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.160]   you're like, "Are the Parisians depressed?"
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.560]   Because the level of festivity is very tame,
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.880]   but it's also beautiful right now, too.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.840]   It's very green.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.000]   Brittany, as I mentioned before, very wild,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.200]   obviously incredible seafood, beautiful towns.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   Then you have Normandy, which is sort of like
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.920]   almost between Brittany and Ile-de-France,
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.400]   the region where Paris is.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.960]   And you have the D-Day beaches.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.720]   You have lots of beautiful small towns.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.520]   You can go to the ocean.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.360]   And then on a completely different register,
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.040]   you have the Basque Coast, southwestern France,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.320]   almost getting down into northern Spain,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.240]   where you have San Sebastian and Bilbao.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.200]   And so a lot of people will do that route, actually.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.360]   They'll fly into maybe Biarritz
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.440]   and visit Bayonne, Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.960]   There are also big surf towns,
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.360]   which is really quite special
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.520]   if you're into that kind of like ocean sport
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.920]   kind of adventure, but also very good food.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.640]   And then heading down even further
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.000]   into Spanish Basque country.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.800]   Obviously, you mentioned Provence,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.160]   but you have Provence sort of like south
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.000]   where Marseille and Avignon is.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   And then you have the Riviera south,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.240]   which is very glitzy, very glam.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.400]   I don't love all of it.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.240]   I think some of it is very overly sceny.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.400]   Saint-Tropez is like my least favorite place in France,
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.280]   just like Cannes.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.920]   I think they're completely overrated.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.160]   But if you have a lot of money to spend,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.400]   I would say between the two, go to Saint-Tropez
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.480]   because there are some absolutely spectacular hotels.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.080]   But as a general rule, they kind of let you down.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.320]   They're kind of like the Vegas of France in some ways.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.040]   And then the Alps, I mean, gosh,
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.480]   some of the most incredible experiences I've had
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.400]   were in the mountains
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.320]   and not only in the winter when there's snow.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.760]   So I've been to areas around Meugeve during the summer
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.000]   and done amazing hikes.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.400]   And then you go back in the winter
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.000]   and yes, like a lot of Europe,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.920]   there's less and less snow during the winter
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   for proper skiing.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.160]   And so that's, again, another environmental reality.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.040]   But the benefit of someplace like Meugeve
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.440]   is that it's lower altitude.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.800]   And so even if you can't have
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.600]   the incredible ski slope experience,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.680]   you have at least a village and another vibe
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   that's quite special with the chalets
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.120]   and you can go snowshoeing.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.320]   There's just like, whatever you want to do in this country,
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.640]   you can probably do it
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.000]   and have very different cuisine along the way.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.080]   I'm glad you mentioned cuisine
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.760]   'cause that's kind of like a core tenant
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.520]   of my style of travel.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.120]   But before we go too far down that path,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.400]   I'm thinking, gosh, you just described like,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.880]   I don't know, 10 trips.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.880]   And that's a good thing, right?
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.120]   Like all I can think about now
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.080]   is we should probably just move there for a few months.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.160]   You know, it's like, why not?
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.400]   And what I want to know is,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.480]   okay, so someone's now like,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.000]   wow, I was going to take this trip.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.040]   Is Paris a must add on a trip if you haven't been?
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.640]   Or I mean, you live there, you didn't mention it,
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.600]   I assume because I've said outside of Paris.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.720]   To me, it's like inconceivable not to come to Paris
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.640]   at least once, because I think it's so important,
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.000]   even if for sort of a generalized understanding of France
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.320]   and how it functions.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   For better or for worse,
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.400]   it's a country that has centered everything
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   around Paris, really.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.520]   And that has to do with the way the monarchy was,
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.360]   the way the royal court had set things up,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.800]   the way that they perceived,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.240]   not only the economic center,
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.800]   but the cultural center of the country
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.440]   was necessarily in Paris.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.160]   And so they kind of still have this weird thing
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.520]   where it's like Paris is the golden child
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.120]   and then everywhere else is the rest of France.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.320]   Obviously, people don't view it that way
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.280]   on an everyday level, but you do get the sense,
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.880]   especially when you're going to museums
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.680]   and you're digging into that history on a visit to Paris,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   you see how important Paris has always been.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.720]   In the US, obviously you have the original colonies
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.840]   that were super important,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.800]   New York, Philadelphia, Virginia, okay.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.520]   But Paris is like on another level.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.880]   And so I think for you to contextualize
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.760]   the way the country functions,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.200]   of course, if that's interesting to you,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.640]   I mean, I think it's kind of crucial
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.240]   to have an understanding of a country
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.920]   if you're gonna visit and go beyond just like,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.160]   again, checking off a list,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.520]   but really getting under the surface of a place.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.200]   It's helpful to at least know
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.480]   whether it's in a day or two,
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.040]   have had some sort of experience
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.320]   that contextualizes Paris and the rest of France.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.720]   And just from a cultural, historical,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.160]   architectural perspective and a culinary perspective,
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.040]   like you'd be missing out.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.680]   You'd be missing out on a truly exceptional
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   and fascinating and dynamic experience
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.440]   by overlooking Paris.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.600]   - I don't disagree having been there plenty of times,
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.440]   and we're gonna spend some time on Paris.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.880]   I imagine the average person's not gonna be able
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.600]   to go to all the places you mentioned.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.920]   If you wanna try the cuisines of those places,
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.680]   I imagine Paris is the place outside of any region
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.920]   to find exposure to other styles in life
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.680]   and food in one place.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.640]   - That's very true.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.640]   The destination that is maybe least represented in Paris
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   is Marseille, and that's a whole other breed onto itself.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.360]   But cities like Paris and even Lyon,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.960]   you can probably find a fair amount
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   of all the other regional cuisines
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.640]   to varying degrees of excellence and expertise.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.720]   But no, honestly, Paris is the ideal place
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.800]   to get that exposure.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.040]   - So I asked Notion AI to write an exciting
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.280]   action movie trailer style intro for our next sponsor,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.920]   and here we go.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.160]   In a world where chaos reigns,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.920]   Notion rises above the rest as the all-in-one workspace
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.400]   for your notes, tasks, and projects.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.000]   With its sleek design and powerful functionality,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.520]   Notion is the ultimate tool for streamlining your workflow
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.120]   and keeping you on track.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.280]   Whether you're navigating the treacherous terrain
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.400]   of the office, the classroom, or your personal life,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.040]   Notion has everything you need
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.840]   to stay organized and productive.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   So what are you waiting for?
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.440]   All right, that's pretty amazing, right?
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   I mean, I absolutely love Notion
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.960]   and basically run my entire business life on it,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.040]   but for the last few months,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.520]   I've really been learning how to use Notion AI,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.240]   and I can't emphasize how much time I'm saving.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.040]   Notion AI helps you work faster,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.640]   write better, and think bigger,
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.120]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.840]   And the best part is that Notion has the power of AI
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.720]   built right into the product,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.760]   not a separate AI tool or browser tab
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.360]   that you have to copy and paste everything between.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.440]   So try Notion AI for free

[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.720]   With travel back on the calendar and my kid in preschool,
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   I need an easy way to optimize my immune system
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.160]   and get some extra energy every day,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.000]   which is why I kickstart my day
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.080]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.760]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.280]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.040]   because I think it's the best option
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.920]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.640]   You take one scoop of AG1,
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.360]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.640]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.600]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.080]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.240]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.320]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.820]   and energized for the day,
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.320]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.200]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.120]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.920]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.000]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.840]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.320]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.200]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.840]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.460]   to take ownership over your health
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.120]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.980]   So if someone's coming for, like you said,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.020]   two weeks would be great.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.500]   Let's assume they've got 10, 14 days.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.480]   Paris is in there.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.220]   How many days do you think,
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.860]   you could obviously spend all two weeks there,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.820]   but if you're trying to help someone
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.800]   think about constructing their two-week itinerary to France,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.380]   how would you think about breaking it out?
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.140]   And of all the places you just mentioned,
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.860]   are there some highlights you think are great
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.100]   for a first trip?
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.780]   The feedback I get from people is that
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.580]   if they fly directly into Paris,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.240]   it makes sense to sort of start there,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.660]   get acclimated, take your time.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.700]   It's a great place to just sort of walk around.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.160]   So if you're heavily jet lagged
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.040]   and you're sort of gearing up for
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.500]   maybe even a more active trip
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.740]   in the next places you're going,
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.240]   it's good to sort of ease in with Paris.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.560]   It's a lot easier to adjust
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.820]   if all you have to do is walk out your apartment
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.760]   or hotel door and stumble upon a restaurant.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.860]   You don't have to go very far, in other words,
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.860]   to sort of get yourself going when you arrive.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.900]   So I would say spending a handful of days,
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.660]   at least four days in Paris would be ideal, to be honest,
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.120]   before making your way elsewhere.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.800]   And I think for a first time visitor,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.300]   it honestly makes sense to do one of two things,
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.060]   going to Normandy because of the sort of
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.660]   cultural awareness that exists,
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.500]   especially if you're someone who had
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.620]   family active in the war,
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.740]   Normandy is kind of a crucial stopping point.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.300]   And even if you're not interested
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.340]   in the World War II experience,
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.700]   you have such beautiful landscapes,
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.060]   such incredible food,
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.220]   that it would make sense,
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.740]   as this is still relatively close to Paris,
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.380]   I can drive, I could take a train,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.660]   I could experience some things,
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.620]   and then either come back to Paris or move on from there.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.540]   But I think it's a good sort of
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.580]   first step outside of Paris,
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.180]   or skipping that and going directly to the South of France,
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.740]   because that's sort of one of the other iconic experiences
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.420]   and something that is so very different
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.300]   from the Parisian experience.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.620]   So if the idea is you're gonna sort of
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.580]   mix the vibes during your trip,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.300]   being by the Mediterranean is honestly spectacular
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.540]   and opens up a whole other world
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.100]   in terms of understanding France and how it functions.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.860]   Certainly if you're more of an outdoorsy person,
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.260]   I would say going from Paris to Provence
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.100]   or Paris to the mountains would make great sense
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.460]   because there's so much you can do,
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.140]   whether it's, like I said, summer or winter.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.980]   And I would say the Basque country
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.820]   is probably better for people who have been a few times
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.220]   only because it's a very different experience.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.940]   It's more like the people who go to Portugal,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.100]   I think, and go surfing in seaside towns in Portugal
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.060]   or are accustomed to surfing in California.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.700]   That's kind of the vibe there.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.060]   Yes, it's sort of a true French experience,
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.980]   but I don't think on a first trip
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.980]   that's the introduction I would recommend.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.820]   - Okay, I wanna get to the South of France places
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.020]   'cause you mentioned a few not to go,
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.980]   but let's pause for a second there.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.020]   Any places you think that someone might be hearing about
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.580]   when they're planning their trip that are kind of overhyped
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.380]   or maybe kind of emerging and underappreciated?
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.900]   - I would say still Brittany remains like very,
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.380]   there's sort of like a cursory kind of coverage
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.620]   that exists around Brittany for whatever reason.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.140]   Brittany and the Basque country, honestly,
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.340]   those are the two places.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.900]   So again, all the Western coast of France
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.420]   that for whatever reason,
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.220]   I think maybe just being in the shadow
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.700]   of some of these more cinematic places
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.060]   don't get the kind of exposure that they deserve,
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.980]   but they are magnificent, especially in Brittany.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.020]   There's probably more in common with like the Isle of Jersey
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.260]   and like the experience on the English coast
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.300]   than with other places in France.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.220]   So it has this very wild, very natural,
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.060]   totally other worldly almost experience that it offers.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.300]   And the landscapes are just absolutely breathtaking.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.420]   And it deserves to be, I think, more frequented by foreigners
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.100]   simply because it's one of the few places
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.540]   that remains pretty cool even during the summer.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.100]   So when we have the heat wave,
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.340]   it's sort of like always the one place we look on the map
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.620]   to be like, what was the max temperature in Brittany
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.620]   in the week of heat wave?
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.380]   And it usually is the only place in the entire country
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.780]   that is like summer acceptable.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.100]   - So maybe a good place to add on if it's a hot summer.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.260]   And finally, any mistakes you think people make
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.820]   when they're planning their trip that you're like,
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.980]   hey, just before we get into any more details,
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.860]   don't do X, Y, Z?
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.500]   - One of the things, I mean,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.020]   this is a common American trait, I think,
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.740]   is packing like five suitcases
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.620]   and trying to then go a whole number of places
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.860]   and have to drag all this stuff along.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.580]   And I think that it does a disservice
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.140]   because accommodations are almost always smaller
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.820]   than what they're used to in the States.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.380]   And that must be true in other countries like Australia
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.500]   where things are just bigger.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.860]   And then trying to then take all that stuff
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.180]   and go to too many places in one trip.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.500]   I think people are like, I need to maximize my time,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.220]   I get like two seconds of vacation, I get it.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.220]   But think smaller, think about ease of travel,
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.180]   think about France is very old,
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.420]   much older than perhaps where you're from
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.020]   and the infrastructure tends to be narrower.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.260]   And so when you come on your trip with 70 suitcases
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.500]   full of stuff you don't need
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.820]   or won't even remove from the suitcase,
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.340]   it seems like you're just sort of carrying dead weight
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.580]   and that's gonna be something you have to drag
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.940]   to every place you go.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.940]   So it's sort of this combo of like overpacking your trip
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.500]   with too many destinations.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.420]   - I think there's something that even it's taken me
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.980]   as someone who likes to save money, time to process.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.820]   But there are some countries
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.460]   where you can't buy a lot of things
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.260]   that you might be accustomed to.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.100]   France is not one of those countries.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.020]   Even the simple thing, like we don't buy diapers.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.180]   There's a lot of things.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.540]   You didn't bring a jacket
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.060]   'cause you didn't think it was gonna get that cold.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.500]   There are lots of places that you can go buy a jacket,
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.340]   other things.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.820]   So it's not a country where it's hard
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.580]   to augment what you packed.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.140]   And so I would say, keep that in mind
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.980]   as you're thinking about
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.660]   how much you actually need to bring.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.340]   - Also, I have to add this
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.340]   because this is a common thing that comes up.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.620]   I mean, even from my own father who was like baffled
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.060]   when I was like, you do not need dress shoes.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.740]   We're not going to like a two
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.620]   or three Michelin starred restaurant.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.300]   Every single person who comes to Paris
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.940]   or almost anywhere in this country wears sneakers.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.380]   I mean, it's like a sneaker culture now.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.860]   So this idea that you have to have
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.940]   this excessively formal wear to go out to a restaurant
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.100]   means you're packing lots of stuff you don't need
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.740]   because that is just not the way people go out.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.180]   - And I will even say,
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.580]   I have been to one, two
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.260]   or three Michelin star restaurant in France.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.740]   And I didn't bring a jacket
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.260]   and they had jackets to borrow.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.660]   It didn't fit perfectly,
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.980]   but I met the requirement without having to pack a jacket.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.460]   And so even that,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.260]   there is sometimes ways to skirt around that requirement.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.100]   - Totally.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.580]   It's very rare to get turned away at this point
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.380]   because there's usually sort of a solution.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.860]   But the footwear in particular,
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.380]   since that adds a lot of weight to your suitcase,
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.220]   I just want to be like,
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.540]   go easy on the like fancy footwear.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.180]   You won't need it.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.020]   - All right.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.580]   You talked about slowing down.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.060]   It's where you might meet people.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.060]   How do you describe the culture?
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.860]   I think France has a bit of a reputation
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.020]   in some people's minds for attitude and people.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.620]   Talk about like what you've experienced.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.340]   You've lived there 16 years.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.140]   Like how would you describe the people
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.180]   and the culture in France?
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.180]   - This is overall a people that are very curious,
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.220]   very cultured, very in tune with the land.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.460]   I'd say the average person knows probably more about food
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.940]   and where it comes from than other people I've met
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.140]   or that I grew up with.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.980]   They tend to lean quite intellectual,
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.420]   a little bit philosophical.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.460]   Yes, they can have a bit of an attitude.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.260]   They can have a bit of a cynical outlook on life.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.420]   And I think part of that has to do
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.660]   with sort of falling from greatness historically.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.700]   You were the great superpower, you had the kings,
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   then you had the revolution.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.140]   And then from there, you also had de Gaulle
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.300]   who told you that they were a great people.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.460]   And then you sort of slide out of being
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.900]   this sort of superpower
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.740]   and they have a lot of soft power, obviously.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.380]   I mean, this is the culture that produces
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.940]   and exports a staggering number of high-end products, right?
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.580]   From this incredible artisanal know-how
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.220]   when it comes to fashion and handbag and food products
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.340]   and sort of all sorts of things.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.820]   But it's no longer the diplomatic or political power
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.660]   that it used to be.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.820]   And so I think some of that is like,
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.980]   they have this bit of a chip on their shoulder of like,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.340]   well, we were historically great and powerful.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.180]   And I think that's something
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.540]   that comes into play quite a lot,
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.020]   especially as I often analyze
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.860]   like the way the politics worked here
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.460]   and the way people perceive some of their rights
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.060]   and that they should always have them
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.420]   or not have them or whatever.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.860]   All the debates that exist on what they should
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.500]   or shouldn't be given without any fight,
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.100]   I think all leads back to sort of their trajectory
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.660]   as a culture, as a country.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.780]   So they're very proud people.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.260]   Obviously they have a lot to be proud about.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.220]   They've contributed a great number of artistic
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.900]   and gastronomic innovations in the world,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.980]   but also architecturally.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.180]   I mean, Paris in particular was a complete innovator
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.380]   when it came to urban planning within Europe
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.420]   in the 17th and 18th centuries.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.820]   So that narrative or the perspective of Paris and France
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.340]   as sort of this global innovator
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.980]   kind of got lost along the way
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.020]   because other cultures picked up the pace
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.500]   or out-innovated them.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.620]   But this is a culture that I think is very proud
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.940]   of all the things that its people,
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.300]   its greatest minds have done for the world.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.500]   And also it's a culture that I think struggles
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.300]   with certainly some of the ills of its past.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.460]   Is there any other country
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.420]   that has properly come to terms with their past?
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.260]   Probably not.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.980]   But this is like an ongoing part of their existence
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.780]   and you get that sense
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.500]   that they're still grappling with some things.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.460]   Depending on where you go,
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.580]   that'll be more or less palpable.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.460]   But I'm sure some of your listeners
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.780]   will have heard or seen videos
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.460]   of the protests that we had since the beginning of the year
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.660]   on the pension reform.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.420]   And you can't dissociate something like that happening
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:33.420]   and the outpouring of passionate critique or resistance.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.820]   You can't associate that
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.260]   with the way the culture functions overall.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.180]   I mean, they fight for their rights
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.700]   and that's quite admirable.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.660]   And if that means that like your route to a museum
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.980]   gets disrupted, like, yeah,
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.020]   that's kind of part of what you come for in a way.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.180]   You're seeing a people that are really still fighting
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.940]   for the rights they wanna protect
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   and the rights that they feel that they still deserve.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.500]   And I think you feel that in a way
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.300]   that you might not feel it to the same extent
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.020]   in other European nations.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.380]   That's a good background on who they are,
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.620]   but what kind of local experiences
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.940]   when it comes to personal interactions
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.660]   do you think American or foreigner
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.740]   traveling to France can expect?
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.660]   I think as long as you're willing to engage with locals,
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.740]   they'll engage with you.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.980]   I mean, if you try to speak a few words in French
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.740]   just to be like, hey, I speak very little French,
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.620]   I speak English, can I talk to you in English?
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.740]   And then you go from there
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.900]   and then you engage them on whatever they're drinking
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.060]   or what they recommend in the neighborhood.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.980]   People are warm.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.820]   People want to have that engagement with people,
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.100]   with travelers.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.340]   And I think the problem arises
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.940]   when travelers sort of assume
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.660]   that they need to be sort of experience the city
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.900]   alongside of the people,
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.540]   but without actually trying to connect with them.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.540]   I think that does a disservice to the experience.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.020]   And then you're missing something
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.780]   that's sort of integral to the experience.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.940]   And it could be as simple as like,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.260]   let's say you're having a wine tasting in Burgundy
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.740]   and you're like, you know what?
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.620]   I'd love to know what you recommend.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.300]   Where do you go when you're not at work?
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.020]   Or where do you go when you're with your family?
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.740]   Trying to get a sense of their version of the place
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.180]   and it usually allows them to relax
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.660]   and it gives them the chance
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.860]   to sort of provide for your trip.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.780]   If they can make a difference in your trip,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.340]   sort of as a gift to them.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.300]   And so I get the sense that there's this love of sharing
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.780]   that you just need to tap into, but it's there.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.700]   - I never thought about this until just this moment,
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.340]   but there's such a stark difference
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.940]   between asking someone like,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.300]   where's the best X versus what do you think the best X is?
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.060]   And it seems like a strategy,
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.940]   maybe anywhere in the world, but especially in France
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.900]   might be to make all of your conversations
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.420]   very personal to the person you're talking to.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.260]   - You nailed it.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   That is exactly what it is.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.980]   I mean, the French wanna feel like you're inquiring them
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.460]   because it's them and not just that they happen to be
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.860]   a body that lives in proximity to some other stuff.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.700]   I think that's an accurate way of assessing
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.020]   what they appreciate.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.660]   Just like they don't expect you to be fluent.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.220]   You don't need to like get bent out of shape
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.460]   that you can't have a full on conversation with them,
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.060]   but they do really appreciate you trying,
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.100]   whether it's with just the sort of salutations
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.220]   or asking where's the bathroom, like just try.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.500]   - Any topics that if you find yourself at a bar
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.940]   having a conversation that you're like,
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.300]   just don't bring these things up,
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.500]   they don't lend well to a conversation in France.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.980]   - I think talk about wealth is very taboo,
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.300]   especially given the disparities that exist
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.900]   between the ultra wealthy and the far less wealthy.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.140]   I would say, stay clear of politics.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.460]   I mean, if you ask people about the president,
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.460]   you don't live in the country,
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.460]   so you don't have that much of maybe a stake,
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.860]   but it can get kind of heated.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.460]   And I think then you run the risk of them asking,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.220]   especially if you're from the US,
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.180]   that will veer right back into sort of
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.740]   the American political system.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.460]   And if that's not something you're really in the mood
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.900]   to start debating, then like,
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.340]   just keep politics off the table.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.500]   - Okay, I like it.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.540]   I used to say I didn't think buying a second home
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.140]   was a good financial decision,
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.700]   but then I discovered fractional vacation home ownership
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.860]   and I actually bought one with Picasso.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.500]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.900]   Don't worry, this is not a timeshare pitch.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.180]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.580]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.940]   then creates an LLC for each home.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.460]   So you can buy as little as one eighth of the property
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.100]   and have real ownership, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.900]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.220]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance,
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.540]   bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.380]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.540]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.100]   When we first heard about Picasso,
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.500]   it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.100]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.580]   toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.020]   Since then, it's truly become our second home
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.580]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.820]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.860]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.020]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.820]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.420]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.780]   So for a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.740]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.060]   where All The Hacks listeners
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.460]   will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.020]   which means you can see new listings
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.940]   before they go live on the website
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.140]   and up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso, P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:25.780]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.180]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.060]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.180]   for a good hang.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.260]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.220]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.140]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.860]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.700]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.540]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.940]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.900]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.380]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.460]   that you got through another week.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.580]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.100]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.860]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.980]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.620]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.180]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.180]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.220]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.060]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.100]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.740]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.220]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.300]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.140]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.180]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.380]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.300]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.780]   and supporting the show.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.620]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.340]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.100]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.660]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.860]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.500]   We haven't talked a little bit about broadly people
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.220]   and who it makes sense to travel with.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.340]   We went with kids.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.380]   Is France easy for someone with lots of children
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.220]   to travel around?
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.060]   We were only in Paris.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.700]   Are people warm and welcoming to children being around?
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.020]   What's your perspective?
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.380]   They absolutely can be warm and welcoming to children.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.900]   However, if you know that you have children
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.860]   who are like really ill-behaved, just good luck.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.820]   Because the French are not going to hold back.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.340]   If you're on a train and your kids
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.020]   are going absolutely ballistic,
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.500]   you'll hear from some people who are like,
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.900]   you're disturbing us, you need to get a hold on your kids.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.300]   Again, I can only speak to Americans,
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.260]   but the way the Americans tend to handle
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.460]   those kinds of situations,
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.140]   they'll give you like horrible side eye.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.620]   They might scoff at you.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.180]   If they're older, they might definitely
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.980]   try to like parent for you.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.220]   And I just think there are certain places,
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.580]   given there's a lot going on,
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.980]   especially in a city like Paris,
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.700]   there are a lot of people, there's a lot of noise,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.220]   there's a lot of people trying to move quickly.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.700]   No, we're not quite like New York,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.900]   but people are still trying to get to where they need to go.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.980]   And if you're traveling with like a bunch of kids
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.580]   and they're rowdy and you don't have a hold on them,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.180]   yeah, I think it's going to be stressful for everyone,
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.660]   yourself included.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.820]   I also think that in Paris, especially,
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.340]   you don't see a lot of very, very young kids at restaurants.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.220]   I think parents tend to, here,
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.340]   they take them out to the parks,
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.220]   they go to kid-focused places,
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.540]   and maybe during the day they'll take their kid to a cafe
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.380]   for a snack or a hot chocolate or something.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.180]   But in the evening, that tends to be sort of like
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.660]   parents' time.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.340]   So almost all of my friends who have kids,
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.940]   it's extremely rare that they go out
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.820]   with their children to dinner.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.220]   So that might mean if you're really looking
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.180]   to have a special meal without the kids,
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.060]   maybe you need to have a plan for a babysitter.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.820]   And there are locals and resources
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.940]   where you can figure that out,
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.180]   or maybe you have an older child
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.660]   who can watch the younger child, I don't know.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.580]   But it's totally possible.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.540]   All of France can be super fun with kids,
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.300]   but just know that it depends on your children.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.820]   And I think you need to be honest with yourself
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.700]   about what kind of kids you have.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.220]   - I will say we went out to dinner almost exclusively
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.900]   with a six-month-old and a two-year-old,
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.100]   and were greeted warmly.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.340]   - They must be very well-behaved, too.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.020]   - I would say as well-behaved as children that age could be,
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.060]   but it went pretty well.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.340]   So, great.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.140]   And then, what about food?
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.420]   Are there culinary experiences that people need
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.500]   to be having on any trip to France, specific ones?
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.540]   - What I would say is that people who come to Paris
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.340]   specifically, because Paris is really the place
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.660]   you could have a whole host of culinary experiences,
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.740]   some of which are traditionally French,
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.100]   and then the rest are a very modern interpretation
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.740]   of what it means to eat in Paris today.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.260]   And that might be blended with Southeast Asian food,
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.420]   it might be blended with Mediterranean cuisine,
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.900]   and Mediterranean cuisine could mean
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.260]   from sort of the Levantine parts of the world
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.140]   to the Italian and French coast.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:50.060]   So, it really depends on what you're sort of looking for.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.500]   I would say, if you're gonna go to a place like Paris,
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.460]   if you're gonna go to a place like Marseille,
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.500]   where there are multiple cultural influences,
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.940]   it behooves you to sort of say,
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.300]   I'm gonna have some very classically
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.500]   French bistro experiences,
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.260]   I might have a neo-bistro experience,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.020]   which is very contemporary, very inventive,
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.740]   very market-driven, and I'm also going to have
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.540]   some of the other kinds of diasporic cuisines
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.260]   that are very present in these places,
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.860]   because they sort of all make up the fabric of the place.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.900]   That's the important thing to keep in mind.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.340]   Obviously, when you go to regions
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.780]   that haven't really expanded their international influences,
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.100]   it makes sense to go with whatever is there.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.220]   Places where it's very seafood-heavy,
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.340]   and it's all very local,
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.100]   and whatever the local vegetables are,
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.700]   like, do that, have that experience.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.780]   But certainly, like you mentioned, which was a great point,
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.820]   if you have limited time,
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.060]   and you're not gonna get to a lot of regions,
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.140]   there's quite a lot of choice in Paris alone
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:47.580]   to have sort of a smattering of those regional flavors.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.420]   - That's great.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.780]   And is there a source someone could use,
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.340]   whether it's an app, a site,
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.140]   to find reliably good ratings or places to eat?
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.500]   At least my experience, TripAdvisor is not that.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.780]   What do the locals use?
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.140]   Is it just word of mouth?
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.420]   - It's word of mouth, but also we use,
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.580]   so it's le, and then fooding.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.500]   I don't know what to call them.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.020]   They're a little bit more of a niche eater.com, maybe,
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.580]   that's in English as well.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.540]   And so if you type in, let's say,
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.380]   obviously Paris is super represented,
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.900]   Marseille, the big cities.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.540]   But if you even type in, like, I'm going to MegÃ¨ve,
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   which is obviously a much smaller destination,
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.980]   they too will probably have a few recommendations.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.820]   So I would say a gauge of quality,
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.220]   also kind of vibe.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.940]   I think the places that end up in le fooding are both good
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.860]   and also have a certain atmosphere.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.780]   And I think that to have a little bit more
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.820]   of an insidery pool of suggestions,
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.460]   that's a better idea than getting, like,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.020]   Joe from whatever city in America
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.300]   who said he liked this place that he found randomly.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.860]   That's the difficulty with TripAdvisor
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.180]   and places that sort of just accumulate traveler opinions.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.100]   I mean, I think if you're looking
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.340]   for where the locals go,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.580]   you definitely go to a site that is run
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.780]   also by locals and local journalists.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.300]   I would say Instagram can be helpful as well.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.540]   And if you're looking, you know, specifically for Paris,
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.580]   like I have my own digital guide to Paris.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.980]   I also obviously wrote a book,
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.820]   but the more updated version,
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.820]   it's like a PDF you get and you can use it
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.300]   and you can put things on your Google map.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.620]   There is a connected Google map.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.100]   And so there are people who do that,
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.740]   which I think is helpful.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.860]   If you sort of sense that someone is a trustworthy voice,
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.700]   they might have something already built in for you
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.500]   to either use or purchase or whatever
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.500]   that could give you kind of a whittled down,
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.660]   but sharp curated list of places to eat.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.700]   And then if you're obviously a Michelin person,
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.380]   if you're looking for sort of the fine dining,
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.140]   I mean, that remains still like a very acceptable guide
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.220]   to planning your eating.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.900]   It's just might empty your wallet after a while.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.740]   - Well, your guide is fantastic.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.940]   I'm gonna link to that in the show notes.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.980]   People can check that out and know where to get it.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   Couple of logistic things, timing.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   What time do people eat?
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.340]   Do you need reservations?
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.180]   Any kind of logistical guides for eating?
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.180]   - Yes, so depending on where you go,
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.460]   I mean, obviously it can vary,
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.620]   but for the most part,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.460]   you're not really gonna be with other people
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.220]   until at least seven, 7.30.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.740]   Seven is super early.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.260]   That's like almost early bird here.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.500]   There are a few places that do all day service,
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.740]   sort of like the nonstop groceries,
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.020]   but that only gives you a certain type of food, obviously.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.380]   It's like a small percentage of your options.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.740]   So don't figure that you're gonna have an ambiance
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.420]   and get to start eating before 7.38.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.500]   In other parts of France,
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.900]   there might be second seatings that are at 9 p.m.,
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.900]   but for the most part,
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.820]   especially when you get into small towns,
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.260]   it's probably going to be 7.30
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.700]   and they stop serving at 10 or 10.30.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.260]   So I think you need to keep that in mind
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.140]   if you need an afternoon snack.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.780]   Also, the other thing people sometimes forget
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.060]   is that they don't necessarily serve lunch everywhere
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.780]   through the entire afternoon.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.180]   So if it opens at 12 or 12.30 for lunch,
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.740]   it may close by 3 p.m. for lunch service.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.460]   So that's something you definitely need to plan.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.020]   And in big cities with some pretty trendy
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.140]   or just like generally really beloved establishments,
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.780]   reserving ahead is better.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.740]   But if you arrive and you're in a hotel
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.220]   and you speak to your concierge,
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.860]   they can also try to help get you in
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.380]   so that you don't need to completely plan
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.660]   everything in advance.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.980]   My general recommendation is try to book a few things
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.460]   and then leave the rest up to sort of improv.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.980]   In some places, I find that
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.820]   if you see a place that looks crowded
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.460]   and it looks like it's not a bunch of tourists,
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.140]   it's probably a good spot.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.100]   Don't worry about it.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.260]   Does that advice apply?
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.340]   That usually bears out.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.820]   I mean, popular could also mean though
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.340]   that depending on the time of day,
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.900]   it could mean you're in an area with a lot of companies
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.140]   and people are on their lunch break
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.300]   and they go to a certain place
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.140]   because it's convenient, inexpensive, and fine,
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.380]   but like maybe wouldn't be great in the evening.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.940]   And that's not something you're necessarily gonna know
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.460]   if you don't really know a city
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.140]   and sort of where the business districts are.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.340]   But for the most part, yeah.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.180]   If you don't get the sense
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.900]   that it's like all English-speaking,
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.900]   by the same token,
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.220]   there are a bunch of very excellent restaurants in Paris,
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.140]   for example, where there are,
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.180]   because they've been written about so much,
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.660]   they actually have a largely English-speaking clientele
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.380]   but are also good.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.460]   So it depends if you want to have that chef
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.820]   or those owners experience
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.540]   while also being seated with other English speakers.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.580]   To me, it's like only a thing on occasion I'll do
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.820]   because I'm really into trying or supporting that chef
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:26.660]   or restaurant owner,
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.260]   but I do find it a bit jarring to be in a place
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.740]   where like potentially maybe my husband and I
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.380]   are the only ones speaking French.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.700]   So in general, I personally, when I travel,
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.420]   try to avoid those scenarios
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.060]   because I'm never gonna really do the research
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.540]   to find out, but like, is it really worth me going?
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.780]   Like, that's already a bit off-putting.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.820]   - Okay, you mentioned Paris.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.460]   Let's dive in 'cause I wanna make sure
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.460]   we get to some details.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.620]   You know Paris incredibly well.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.060]   You've written books about Paris in multiple languages.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.740]   It's impressive.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.540]   Let's talk about someone planning there.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.180]   You said, you know, at least three or four,
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.140]   could be a week, days in Paris.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.780]   - Well, in terms of staying,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.780]   I think the first question to ask
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.740]   is what neighborhood do you really wanna be planted in?
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.580]   Because that can determine
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.900]   the rest of your itinerary essentially.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.020]   I mean, no, nothing is really that far to get to.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.540]   And if you're gonna use public transport,
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.820]   you could be in the 11th arrondissement where I live
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.700]   and still go to the Fondation Louis Vuitton,
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.220]   which is on the Western extremities of the city.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.620]   So it's not impossible, but I think you need to know
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.820]   sort of what you're gonna do the most of.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.820]   Are you gonna be going to a lot of museums?
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.820]   Are you really keen on being near the river?
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.740]   That would dictate sort of
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.300]   what neighborhoods I would recommend to you.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.980]   And once you've narrowed down
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.260]   what neighborhood you wanna be in,
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.020]   and then you can go into sort of,
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.660]   okay, do you want an apartment?
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.900]   Airbnbs are getting way more expensive.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.820]   At this point, some people think that hotels
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.740]   are back to being sort of the greatest value,
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.900]   and you can also get a lot of boutique hotels,
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.860]   which are really charming, really interesting,
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.660]   great views, great services,
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.380]   and put you sort of in the heart of the action.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.300]   I know a lot of people who stay in the Saint-Germain area
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.100]   because it's close to a lot of things.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.380]   It's near the river.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.380]   It's very charming.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.580]   It's very picturesque.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:05.140]   But for the best food experiences, it's not there.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.780]   So I think the person who's planning needs to think like,
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.780]   okay, am I the food traveler
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.220]   who really just wants to go to all the best restaurants?
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.380]   In which case, there's a huge concentration of them
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.740]   in Eastern Paris.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.660]   Maybe it's best I stay sort of right bank
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:25.660]   over by Bestie or near Oberkampf or in the Marais, at least,
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.300]   because at least that is sort of getting you closer.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.220]   If that's not your thing and you really are like,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.900]   I want to go antique shopping and go to museums
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.420]   and be in the pure center of the city,
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.580]   then I'd say, yeah, you could stay in the first,
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.260]   you could stay in the sixth, you could stay in the fifth,
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.420]   but it might not be the most dynamic in the evening.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.300]   Generally, I think that the seventh
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.860]   is one of the more boring places to stay.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.620]   It's very sleepy, it's very residential,
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.660]   so yes, that's closer to the Eiffel Tower,
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.180]   but you don't need to seat in your backyard
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.340]   to have a wonderful experience.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.140]   - I just realized we both have been to Paris,
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.260]   you've lived there 16 years, I've been there a bunch.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.780]   For anyone who doesn't know, Paris is structured-
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.420]   - Like a snail, it's a snail.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.540]   - 20 arrondissements.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.700]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.020]   - And they kind of circle around from the center,
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:14.660]   so one being dead center going clockwise around to 20.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.740]   So just if you hear references to the seventh and the fifth,
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.620]   you could just search Paris map
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.060]   and you'll see all of these numbers
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.020]   highlighting the regions.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.860]   - Yes, it's true.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.580]   I often forget that this is not the most common knowledge.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.340]   I take that for granted, so good thing you reminded people.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.580]   At the end of the day, if you're like,
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.860]   "I struggled to find a place and this is what I could find
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.500]   "and it was in the 15th arrondissement,"
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.660]   you'll be fine and you'll probably
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.300]   have a really lovely experience, but it's not ideal, right?
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.700]   So there are just neighborhoods where you're gonna get
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.140]   the sense that you're in the heart of things,
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.820]   that you're close to things, that it could be practical
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.460]   given the type of trip you want to have.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.180]   - Is there a place that you'd put if you're like,
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.660]   "I wanna feel like I'm staying somewhere
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.740]   "where I'm surrounded by locals,
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.260]   "I'm having a local experience,
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.540]   "I'm close enough to things,
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.380]   "but I'm okay trekking to the sites,
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.460]   "I'm okay trekking to the best restaurants,
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.380]   "but I just kinda want a fun, interesting neighborhood
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.220]   "with good cafe, I can go relax,
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.060]   "but just feel like I'm not in the mix of it."
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.460]   Is there a place you'd throw out?
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.580]   - Yeah, I would say my part of town.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.140]   It's funny 'cause we tend to think of things
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.900]   in terms of their metro neighborhoods,
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.220]   so like Charon, where there's a lot of good food.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.820]   For those listening who have been here
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.820]   and who might know Paris,
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.820]   it's not far from the restaurant Septime,
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.580]   which is sort of like now totally beloved.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.900]   You could stay in Belleville,
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.860]   which is hugely dynamic and super diverse
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.020]   and super interesting.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.300]   And that gets you close to a park that I really love
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.380]   called the Butte Chaumont.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.900]   So either in Belleville or further up
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:40.140]   into the 19th arrondissement would be wonderful
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.540]   and you could easily get on the metro
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.860]   and get right back in the center of things.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.980]   And then on the flip side,
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.940]   if you want sort of a very calm and quiet experience,
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.620]   then yeah, I would say the 5th and 6th deeper in,
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.740]   sort of closer to like Luxembourg Gardens
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:56.340]   is probably gonna be more of a tranquil,
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.380]   serene, relaxing kind of experience
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.740]   that isn't necessarily right in the middle,
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.340]   but will be lovely.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.500]   - Okay, and just for everyone's awareness,
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.940]   I don't wanna go in and say, "Here are the 50 sites."
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.740]   Like we don't need to list off all the tourist destinations
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.420]   that everyone can find in any guide or anything like that.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.180]   But I would love to tap on, "What are a few things?"
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.020]   Because like you said,
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.300]   we don't wanna plan your whole trip for you.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.020]   We wanna just give you some inspiration.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.100]   Are there a few things in Paris that you think
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.220]   aren't the obvious attractions or activities
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.940]   that someone should put on their list to check out?
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.540]   Maybe they're not good for everyone,
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.660]   but for some people, worth sharing.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.380]   - Yeah, people who are overwhelmed by the Louvre,
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.140]   especially, which I know I am,
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.100]   there are plenty of smaller museums.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.540]   This is sort of the city of smaller museums
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.220]   and also what you would call a house museum.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:50.060]   So the former private home of a very prolific writer, artist.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.140]   And there are several that I think are worth visiting.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.100]   The MusÃ©e de Montmartre, which is in the 18th.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.460]   So if you're gonna go up toward the SacrÃ©-CÅur Cathedral
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.700]   or Basilica in that neighborhood,
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.620]   so the 18th Arrondissement,
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.420]   that's a fantastic, small, really intimate museum.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.820]   And I believe they have a nice inner garden.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.020]   You also have the Gustave Moreau Museum.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.500]   And similarly, it's so beautiful.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.620]   It's quite small, really inexpensive entry fee,
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.660]   and is focused on, it was the former home
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.420]   of the artist Gustave Moreau.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.100]   And so all of it is sort of not recreated,
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.220]   but sort of frozen in time as though it's how he left it.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.460]   And his works are displayed
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   and there's this really iconic spiral staircase
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.380]   that's really beautiful.
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.420]   And that's a much smaller, less overwhelming experience.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.500]   And then for something bigger,
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.380]   but still completely worth visiting
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.620]   is the Carnavalet Museum, which is in the Marais.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.820]   And it's the city of Paris museum, essentially.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.580]   And so you have all of the works,
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.180]   all of the exhibits are related to the history of Paris.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.220]   And that is just sort of a non-negotiable for me,
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.020]   but it often doesn't make the list for people
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.820]   when they come and they're doing the Louvre,
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.100]   the MusÃ©e d'Orsay, and some of the other big classics.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.140]   And then finally, I would say,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.740]   if you're really into contemporary art,
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.260]   you could go the gallery route,
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.660]   which is a little bit more intimidating,
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.460]   and I think a little bit less sort of easy to navigate,
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.900]   or you could go to the Pinot Collection,
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.660]   which is one of France's billionaires
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.580]   who has a private institution,
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.140]   but it's in a really spectacular building,
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.900]   quite in the center of city, not far from the river.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.860]   That's a very unique experience.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.060]   - Because we had kids, skipped out on all of the art.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.460]   So I have nothing to add here,
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.500]   but the CitÃ© des Sciences Museum.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.820]   - Oh, for kids, yeah, that's great.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.900]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.740]   I wish our kids' nap schedule allowed us to be there longer,
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.460]   but I will give it a plug there.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.980]   It might be the best kids' science museum I've ever been to,
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.940]   which I can't say I've been to a lot, but it was awesome.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.700]   The park around it was awesome, easy to get to.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.940]   So that's my one plug.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.020]   - That's a good plug.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.220]   And also I would say another spot
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.340]   that's also very good for adults and kids
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.300]   is the, it's called the MusÃ©e de la Chasse et la Nature.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.020]   It's the nature and hunting museum,
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.780]   which sounds like it could be a little bit grim,
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.660]   but actually it's super well done.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.860]   It's beautiful.
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.060]   And for kids who are like interested in seeing animals
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.940]   and paintings of animals in the natural environment,
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:05.780]   that's a good choice.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.660]   Or the Natural History Museum,
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.300]   which is in the Jardin des Plantes,
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.380]   which is one of the gardens.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.220]   And there you'll have like dinosaur bones and fossils
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:16.100]   and all sorts of stuff that's like really good for kids.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.740]   - Any other kind of like unique, weird tour kind of stuff,
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.100]   whether it's like at a market,
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.140]   not the museums that we're kind of typically told about,
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.660]   but kind of cool other experiences?
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.460]   - I do think the Catacombs is a really unique experience.
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.620]   You really have to be someone
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:35.420]   who's not afraid of closed quarters and closed spaces.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.860]   You also sort of have to plan ahead
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.540]   because I know that if you go too late in the afternoon,
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.420]   you may hit a point
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.940]   where they're not actually letting anyone in anymore.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.980]   And so you've just sort of waited in line.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.060]   It's very cool though.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.740]   I mean, I think that's something you're not gonna get
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.420]   in a whole lot of other cities.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.260]   And then beyond that,
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.900]   I think there's some sort of unusual tours you can get on
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.300]   that are taking you through a specific history.
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.340]   So it might be like Paris under the Occupation
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.020]   or something like the Women of Paris tour.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.420]   There are things that are sort of
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.220]   not necessarily super unusual,
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:11.620]   but just not your general overview kind of experiences
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.780]   that are worth looking into.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.300]   - Where do these good experiences exist?
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.540]   Is Airbnb Experiences a place to find them?
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.140]   Is there a better local site?
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.500]   Is there a blog that talks about things?
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.740]   - No, that's a very good question.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.660]   I would say Airbnb Experiences,
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.220]   I think are only gonna get you so far.
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.260]   They might be okay,
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.900]   but I for one think the problem
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.540]   is that people don't spend a lot on those.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.780]   And so you sort of get what you pay for.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.740]   If you're really into wine tastings, for example,
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.420]   there are certain specialists, for example, certain spaces.
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.740]   There's the Cave du Louvre,
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.340]   there's Cave Woman Wines,
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.500]   and she runs different events in her wine shop.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.380]   You sort of have to be specific when you're looking.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.060]   But if you're looking for a service
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.820]   that has multiple types of tours or experiences,
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.540]   I think it's good to look at, for example, Context Travel,
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:57.580]   which is a company that runs experiences and tours
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.820]   in a variety of different cities in the world
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.940]   and have very good docents and very good themes.
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.540]   And I think in general,
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.020]   the quality of the experience is very high.
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:10.020]   In Paris specifically, you also have Paris by Mouth,
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.220]   which are obviously, as the name suggests, food-focused tours.
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.740]   And then there are a bunch of independent,
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.260]   smaller run kind of experiences in food.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.540]   I mean, food is really the area
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.380]   where we're like bursting at the seams with options.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.740]   But I would say either you get recommendations
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.660]   from let's say like a travel planner
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:31.220]   who has connections with certain key guides,
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.820]   or I, for one, do a couple of tours upon request
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.100]   that are based on my books, but I don't do this full time.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.420]   So it's sort of like an upon request thing.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.260]   If you're looking for something
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.180]   that you can sort of jump on last minute,
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:45.180]   you need to sort of find bigger companies.
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.220]   Get Your Guide also has some
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:50.180]   that I think are gonna be a little bit more qualitative
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:52.220]   than an Airbnb experience.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.100]   - Okay.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.460]   Food keeps coming up as a theme.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.580]   So I'll just ask you to throw out any places you love
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:58.900]   that people should just check out.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.660]   I know there's an unlimited number of places.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.540]   You haven't been to them all,
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:04.100]   but I bet you have some places where you're like,
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.540]   here's some spots that I'd recommend eating at.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.980]   And I know people love getting
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.940]   the kind of local recommendation.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.740]   - So yeah, I'll give you a couple.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.260]   Actually in the seventh arrondissement,
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.020]   which I know I kind of disparaged earlier,
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.580]   but like the key place is La Migeon,
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:22.300]   and that is just truly excellent consistently.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.580]   The chef owner has been doing it for nearly 20 years.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.340]   It has an incredible vibe.
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.820]   The portions are large.
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.180]   It's excellent, excellent, excellent food.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.380]   There's a bit of a Southwestern French inflection,
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.220]   just really spectacular.
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.460]   Definitely need to book ahead.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:38.740]   The other experience I would say
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.940]   is going into the MarchÃ© des Enfants Rouges,
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.980]   which is the oldest covered market in Paris
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.540]   and hitting up some of those stands.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:48.020]   But if you want something that's like open all day nonstop,
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.100]   there's a stand in particular in the market
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.540]   called Les Enfants du MarchÃ©,
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:57.540]   and it's seafood, good meats, excellent natural wine.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:01.100]   There's a Japanese chef, but it's all French product.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.380]   It's an incredible vibe.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.500]   There's a great playlist,
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:08.140]   and they really run from like noon until the market closes.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:10.140]   So if you stumble in at 4 p.m.,
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.020]   you know you can at least have something to eat,
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.620]   and it may be the only stand open,
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620]   but it'll be super fun.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.260]   You know, there's like kind of a young,
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.620]   really exciting vibe there.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.540]   Quality of the food is just spectacular.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.660]   And there is an excellent park for children right outside,
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.860]   like one or two blocks away, which we went to.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.660]   But my advice to parents in the parks,
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.180]   don't be alarmed if the park closes
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.100]   very promptly and very quickly.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.380]   In the U.S., it's kind of like at night, people leave.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.260]   In France, I've had, there was a whistle,
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.780]   and at the exact moment the park closed,
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.700]   within maybe one to two minutes,
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.060]   the entire park had vacated,
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.900]   the doors had been locked, and everyone was gone.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.500]   And I was caught off guard thinking,
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.780]   well, the sun's still out, we could just keep playing.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.180]   It was like, when the park closes, you leave.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.540]   But that park is right next to that market,
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.500]   and was excellent.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.780]   - Yeah, the Carreau du Temple,
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.700]   there's like a big cultural center over there too.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.820]   So that's a great area to walk around in general.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.820]   But yeah, I think it's kind of like the guards are like,
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.260]   my shift is over, I want to go home.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.100]   Get out of the park.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.100]   I would say also,
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.100]   Semilla is a great place in Saint-Germain.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.180]   I'm trying to give you some options here geographically.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:16.180]   It's a great sort of modern bistro that's really lovely.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:20.460]   And then, oh boy, there's like coffee shops everywhere,
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.180]   like good quality coffee shops.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.460]   If that's something that's important to you,
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.740]   it's something that's important to me.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.340]   You have to make sure you have the list,
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.340]   because if you go into any old corner cafe,
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.660]   you'll probably have a really disgusting cup of coffee.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.380]   - Is that list on your guide?
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.780]   - No, it's a separate guide I am currently working on,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.180]   but a lot of it is also on my Instagram page, for example.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.140]   And in my first book,
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.940]   there's a whole chapter on quality coffee
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.420]   and the difference between cafe culture and coffee culture.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.700]   So if you want to sort of get the foundation
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.540]   for why it's historically been bad,
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.660]   that gives you a nice primer.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.460]   But yeah, I think the market is a really great place
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.780]   because also it'll give you lots of options.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.740]   That's the covered market.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.020]   And then there are the pop-up markets
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.300]   that are several times a week in different neighborhoods.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.700]   Definitely look into that.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.220]   I mean, you can even Google
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.260]   open air food markets in Paris.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.140]   It's a great place to go get a bunch of ingredients
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.580]   and cheeses and go to a park and have a picnic.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.420]   - Love that.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.580]   What about people that are looking for some baked goods?
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.620]   Any suggestions for a couple of bakeries?
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.300]   - I literally am physically incapable
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.420]   of giving just a couple.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.060]   Like it's just tremendous.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.940]   I mean, if there's one that I can recommend
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.180]   that has several locations that might be easy for people,
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.380]   Pierre HermÃ© is the star.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:34.740]   He's been called the Picasso of pastry.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.980]   And so obviously he has like multiple locations.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.220]   His stuff is incredible.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.740]   But you know, I would also say
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.100]   some of the neighborhood bakeries
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.500]   are really where the huge talent is these days.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.180]   And one of my favorites is Utopie.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.220]   I mean, we say Utopie, but it's spelled like Utopia,
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.500]   but with an E at the end.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.660]   - Is it near Open Conf?
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.820]   I can't remember the name of the sub.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.820]   - Yes, that's exactly near where it is.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.660]   - We tried to go there.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.260]   It was like, the line was ridiculous.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.380]   - I mean, that'll tell you something.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.860]   If you go on a Sunday morning, forget it.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.820]   You're going to be waiting in a line,
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.460]   but the pastries are excellent.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.740]   I would say Mamiche is another one.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.140]   They have a location in the 10th
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.740]   and one in the 9th arrondissement,
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.420]   and it's really excellent.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.260]   And then for the rest,
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.100]   I mean, you just got to connect with me and get my list.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.780]   - Definitely connect with Lindsay.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.900]   Getting around.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.580]   Subway, I found easy.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.580]   There's no real need to do anything else.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.300]   I don't think we ever took a taxi
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.980]   or an Uber or anything at all.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.660]   We took the train from the airport.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.660]   Any other things people should think about
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.100]   when it comes to transportation?
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.020]   - Be mindful of the e-scooters.
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.100]   They will be phased out.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.580]   However, at the end of August,
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.260]   because the city voted to get rid of them,
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.900]   they were a bit of a problem,
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.300]   just like the lack of enforcement of rules is a problem.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.220]   But anyway, that's for another conversation.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.700]   So yeah, I would say while they're still sort of operating,
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.580]   you need to be mindful when you're walking around
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.020]   because they zip and come out of nowhere.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.860]   But you really can either walk everywhere
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.780]   or take the Metro.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.620]   And rarely do I encounter people who are like,
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.660]   I love the bus.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.260]   I'm going to try to figure out the bus.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.300]   The bus is like not very efficient
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.220]   only because there's a lot of construction in the city.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.700]   And so even though they have their own lane,
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.100]   they're often delayed
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.740]   and they don't run as frequently as the Metro.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.820]   So you're going to spend a lot more time waiting around,
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.420]   but walk Metro.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.540]   And if you're really courageous,
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.180]   you can take one of the bikes,
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.620]   the city bike share program or the like Uber jump things.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.260]   They're sort of all over the place,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.300]   but there's really very little need to take a cab
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:32.300]   unless you're like stumbling home drunk after a great meal.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.100]   But even then the Metro is probably still operating.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.260]   - We didn't talk actually about drinking and nightlife.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.620]   What's the vibe like for bars after dinner,
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.180]   cocktails, that kind of stuff.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.660]   - Cocktails are still very much a fixture
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.180]   of the dining and nightlife landscape.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.460]   I would say wine bars also are sort of treated
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.140]   almost as destinations like cocktail bars,
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.420]   especially if you're into certain types of wine,
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.380]   like natural wine or organic wine.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.980]   There's like a slew of those kinds of bars
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.140]   and even hotel bars.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.260]   I mean, they definitely are still
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.380]   the more expensive type of experience,
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.700]   but there are some that are still very iconic,
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.860]   whether it's the Hemingway bar at the Ritz
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.060]   or the Ambassador in the Criant Hotel
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.260]   at Place de la Concorde.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.300]   I mean, these are places that are just so sumptuous
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.780]   in terms of their interiors that like,
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.620]   if you really want that vibe
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.260]   and you don't mind spending maybe 25 euros on a cocktail,
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.220]   like go there.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.540]   Otherwise there's really no need
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.700]   to spend a whole lot of money.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.420]   And also if you're into beer,
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.020]   there are some craft beer bars too.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.420]   We have all of the things.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.180]   You can stay out late, but not too late
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.540]   'cause all these places close,
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.140]   I think around one o'clock.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.460]   - You mentioned Le Fooding,
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.140]   but where would you find a good cocktail bar?
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.460]   Google Maps ratings, I find,
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.980]   have become more and more reliable,
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.980]   but is that a source or what would you do?
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.820]   - Google ratings,
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.380]   but actually Le Fooding also lists cocktail bars.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.740]   So you've got both restaurants and cocktails
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.540]   and then there are some specialists.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.420]   There's Forrest Collins who has a website and blog.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.180]   Her nickname is 52 Martinis,
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.060]   but her podcast has a different name.
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.620]   But essentially if you Google 52 Martinis
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.540]   and Paris cocktails,
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.380]   you'll sort of get her expert list
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.540]   and she sort of made that her niche here.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.140]   But for a more general view,
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.300]   Le Fooding has a great list.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.140]   - Okay.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.780]   And then one thing that I've done in Paris
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.500]   and all of France is,
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.420]   you can also get a bottle of wine,
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.700]   get some cheese, just sit in a park.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.060]   So what would you do to craft
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.420]   just like a nice one of those experiences
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.140]   that maybe doesn't need a restaurant?
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:26.380]   - That's a great option
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.220]   that honestly I do on the regular.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.220]   As you and I were talking about
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.700]   when we first jumped on the chat,
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.300]   I was commenting on how it is almost 7.30 here
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.740]   and it's still bright and light.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.260]   And in the heart of summer,
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.900]   you can go to the Canal Saint Martin
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.820]   or by the river
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:42.060]   and you'll have light until well after 10 p.m.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.500]   So that makes it perfect for a picnic.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.780]   But I would say avoid the like student thing,
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.940]   which is going to like the supermarket
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.860]   and buying a supermarket bottle of wine.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.100]   Like go to a wine cellar or a wine shop,
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.260]   make it a special thing,
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.340]   figure out what region
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:56.940]   or what kind of wine you want to drink,
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:00.700]   red, white, orange, sparkling, whatever.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.780]   Figure out the region
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.140]   and then maybe ask the wine expert
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.540]   what they recommend pairing with it,
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.460]   what kinds of cheeses,
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.540]   then go to the cheese monger.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.340]   I mean, so yeah, you can't do this too late at night
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.060]   because obviously the shops close.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.100]   But if you plan for it,
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.220]   you can really get some tremendous products
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.660]   and then sit outside
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:17.900]   and then see other people,
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.380]   mostly locals doing the same thing.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.220]   - Love that.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.060]   It actually reminded me,
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   I had a good friend
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.660]   who gave me a couple of recommendations
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.260]   from his recent trip.
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.180]   He said on the cheese side,
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.060]   fromagerie Laurent Dubois is like the place.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.580]   Couple other random ones he suggested
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.180]   were the Paris Philharmonic or Philharmonique.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.260]   He had a wonderful experience to go out.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.980]   These are all a bit across the board,
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.220]   but I was like, it just made me think to look it up.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.100]   And the other is there's a street artist named Invader,
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.900]   which has these great space invader things.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.220]   And there is a cool app called Flash Invaders
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.820]   where you can kind of collect all of them all over.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.100]   They're all over France,
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.500]   like thousands and thousands
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.660]   of these kind of space invader piece of art just in Paris.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.340]   And he said, not only was it fun for him,
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.100]   but it was super fun for his kids to have a thing
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.780]   to like go around Paris and collect
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.780]   and earn some points.
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.380]   And it kind of made the experience
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.140]   of wandering around the city,
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.980]   which might often make children kind of bored.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.420]   It got them very excited.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.420]   And so those were his three tips.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.700]   - It keeps them very engaged,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.740]   but also the adults.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.380]   My husband does Flash,
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.180]   does the app and plays the game.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.380]   And I have several friends that do this.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.580]   And then those with kids definitely do it with their kids.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.180]   And so it's sort of like fun for everyone.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.500]   And the incentive is just to like gain a lot of points
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.740]   and then beat each other
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.700]   or just be ranked higher than one another.
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.420]   What's interesting about it is in places like Versailles
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:39.140]   or Fontainebleau, which have royal heritage,
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.980]   the mosaic tiles in the invaders themselves
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.500]   or the whatever they're called are very clever.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.300]   I mean, they're related to the place in many instances,
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.940]   especially in like smaller towns.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.380]   So you'll have like,
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.820]   I think there's one of Napoleon somewhere.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:56.300]   So it does create also sort of like semi-educational,
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.660]   but also it's fun.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.500]   - That's one thing where I was like,
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.100]   "Gang, I really missed out on that on my trip."
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.700]   He had one more recommendation,
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.660]   which is kind of in line
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.020]   with what you just mentioned with Versailles,
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.260]   which is we talked about the broader regions of France.
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.220]   We talked about Paris.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.220]   If someone's in Paris
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.820]   and they're looking to go somewhere, but not too far,
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.380]   are there some kind of day trips
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:15.060]   or maybe overnight trips that you'd say
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.100]   someone should tack on?
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.940]   And maybe that's how we'll leave people today.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.140]   - Yeah, I mean, Versailles is definitely the common one,
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.260]   but it's very overwhelming.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.460]   And depending on when you go,
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.020]   it might be literally like everyone and their mother
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.020]   and their grandmother is there.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.340]   And I know it feels very dense and overwhelming,
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:32.260]   but Fontainebleau is the other one that I would recommend
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.940]   because you get the chateau,
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.780]   you get the connection to,
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.620]   you know, it used to be the hunting lodge.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.940]   I mean, lodge is a small word for what it actually is,
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.340]   which is like essentially a palace,
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.900]   but it's where the kings would all go
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.820]   to when they were hunting and sort of a getaway.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.140]   And it's attached to this really lovely city,
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.620]   a town called Fontainebleau,
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.500]   and you can have a meal, you can spend the night,
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.780]   you can go to see the chateau.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.140]   And then if you're an outdoorsy person,
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.620]   you can go to the forest,
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.100]   which is walking distance or a quick ride.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.500]   So it's called the Fontainebleau Forest,
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   and it is an internationally renowned destination
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.380]   for bouldering.
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:08.500]   So like I said, my husband's a boulderer and rock climber.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.460]   This has been ever since I've known him,
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.020]   the place he goes almost every weekend,
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.860]   but you come across people who just want to hike.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.740]   You can go walk around and pick a spot and then picnic.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.620]   It really is a wonderful outdoor place.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.660]   So I would say for a day trip or an overnight,
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.540]   think about Fontainebleau.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.380]   - Awesome.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.580]   The other one my friend suggested was Puy de Fou,
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.460]   this amusement park that he enjoyed as an adult
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.620]   and thought was super interesting,
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.220]   children enjoyed and was like, for him,
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.620]   it was the day trip highlight of the entire trip.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.180]   And his kids thought it was the most amazing thing
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.020]   they've ever done.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.140]   And he's like, and I loved it too.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.340]   I don't know if you've been there.
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.420]   - And I also don't have kids.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:47.460]   It's not like my first instinct to go to a place like that,
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.100]   but that's very good to know.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.460]   And I would say that's a much better idea
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.340]   than going to Disney, which is like very underwhelming
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:56.860]   when or if you've experienced Disney in the U.S.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:58.860]   So skip Disney.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.500]   - But Puy de Fou, I've looked at the website
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.620]   and there's like people jumping and fire.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:05.980]   And he described it as like a mix of a show
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.500]   and a carnival and a Renaissance fair,
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500]   but with excellent food,
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.140]   which just kind of goes back to France is not gonna have
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.420]   their own French amusement park with bad food.
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.340]   He just had wonderful things to say about it.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.420]   So Ethan, thank you for that tip and others.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.340]   And then last thing, as people are getting around,
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.620]   we said Metro in Paris, is it train?
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:26.460]   Is it flights?
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.100]   If people go back to the beginning of this and think,
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.540]   ah, I'm gonna add one or two regions.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.340]   I'm gonna do a day trip to Fontainebleau.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.180]   Is it all train?
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.100]   Or how do you think people should think logistically
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.460]   about getting around?
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.820]   - I think if you're gonna go somewhere
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:41.900]   and then be trying to see a lot of things in another region,
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.740]   you can get there by train, most likely.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.580]   To be honest, you could do everything by train.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:47.780]   It just might take you a while.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.620]   So places that are not on the high speed rail line,
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.100]   you can still access by train.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.540]   So imagine, let's say you're gonna spend a whole week
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.100]   in Normandy, for example.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.140]   I would say you could get there by train,
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.780]   but then you wanna be able to pick up a car.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.380]   And so that might not make a lot of sense
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.860]   given where car rental spots are.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.940]   So from a place like Paris, you could rent a car
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.980]   and drive to Normandy or drive to some of these places
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.900]   if you plan on trying to discover a lot of things.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.100]   The Loire Valley is a place where you could actually do
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.220]   like a bike trip and discover the region entirely by bike
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.180]   because they have something like,
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.940]   I don't know if it's like 800 miles of bike paths
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:21.980]   in the entire region.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:25.140]   So it's sort of set up for that kind of experience.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.260]   And if you're going in to Provence
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.300]   and you're not gonna be staying in cities,
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.860]   and you're gonna be going into villages
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.500]   and trying to drive around and see as much as you can see,
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.500]   you will need a car.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.420]   But there, I'd say you could take a train from Paris
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.300]   and then rent a car when you get down there
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.940]   near the train stations, like Avignon, for example,
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.660]   or Aix-en-Provence or Marseille,
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.660]   and you can rent a car and then go from there.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.180]   The places where people tend to fly
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.740]   simply because it can be faster or more direct
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.740]   is to like to Nice, to Biarritz and the Southwestern coast.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.540]   But there are very few places.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.500]   If you're not in any rush and you like a long train ride,
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.380]   use the train system.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:04.220]   - Amazing.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:05.660]   This has been so awesome.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.300]   So I feel like we didn't even come close
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.980]   to tapping all of your knowledge,
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.980]   but you share a lot on social.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.500]   You have a digital restaurant guide.
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.100]   We're gonna link to it in the show notes.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.180]   You've even written books.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.140]   So there's a lot of stuff you've done,
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.100]   but where can people find all of it
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.860]   and can they reach out and ask questions?
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.700]   - Absolutely.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.820]   So I think the easiest is probably just to find me
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.860]   at lindsaytremuta.com because then you can find my socials,
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.740]   you can find my newsletter signup,
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.140]   you can find my podcast signup,
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.180]   you can find all the things.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.100]   You can find me from there and I'd be happy to chat.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:34.940]   - That's awesome.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.540]   Any parting advice for someone thinking
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.660]   about a trip to France before we sign off?
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:41.780]   - The only thing I would say is do a little bit of research.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.180]   Don't just come and be like, I'm gonna wing everything
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.220]   because I think that's where people get disappointed,
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.260]   especially when it comes with food.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.460]   Do a little bit of planning and then leave the rest
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.860]   up to sort of whatever you feel like doing,
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.980]   whatever the mood leads you to choose.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.940]   But there is a minimum amount of planning
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.140]   that's really necessary to ensure you'll have
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.900]   the experience you deserve to have.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.500]   - I look forward to doing that planning for the next trip.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.700]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.660]   - Thanks, Chris.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:10.020]   - Wow, we covered a lot
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.740]   and I am already excited for another trip to France.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.300]   But before we wrap, I just briefly wanted to talk
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:17.980]   about using your miles and points for your next trip
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.700]   and maybe a little bit about the different ways
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.820]   to get there and some deals to be had.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.420]   So when it comes to flights from North America,
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.940]   almost all of them are gonna be going to Paris,
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.900]   either Charles de Gaulle or Orly,
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.500]   they're two different airports.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.900]   There are in the summer, a few flights to Nice,
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.260]   notably on Delta from Atlanta and JFK,
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.980]   on United from Newark, on La Compagnie,
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.580]   the all business class airline from Newark,
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.220]   and then from Montreal on Air Canada and Air Transat,
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.180]   which is actually an airline I have never heard of.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.500]   There's also a strange flight on Fiji Air to Lourdes,
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   which I think is just because they wanna connect.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.900]   There must be some massive population of people
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.900]   that want to go to Fiji, so they connect all the way there.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.300]   As for getting to Paris,
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.500]   because that's probably where anyone's France trip
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.060]   is going to start,
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.540]   especially if you're not traveling in the summer to Nice,
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.000]   there are a ton, a ton of options.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.020]   You can fly from 22 different cities in the States,
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.380]   you can fly from five cities in Canada,
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.900]   and I didn't quite sum it entirely up,
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:17.680]   but there are a ton of airlines.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.140]   So Air France is probably the largest of all of the options,
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:25.380]   and then American, Delta, and United all fly to Paris.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.460]   Then a few other ones that I'll just flag,
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:31.020]   Air Tahiti Nui flies from Seattle and Los Angeles,
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.100]   connecting on to flights in Papiete,
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:37.320]   and then JetBlue flies from JFK to Paris.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.900]   North Atlantic Airways also flies from JFK to Paris,
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.540]   and La Compagnie flies from Newark,
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.500]   which is an all-business class airline.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.400]   And then there's two others that fly to Orly,
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.220]   which is the smaller airport in Paris.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.100]   One is Corsair, I think it is, flies from Montreal,
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.780]   but looks like it's only in the summer.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:57.480]   And then another one, if you want a good deal,
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.420]   I've actually flown them to Papiete in French Polynesia,
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.380]   is French B, which connects from SFO, LAX,
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.240]   Newark and Miami, all the way to Paris,
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.540]   definitely a great option to save money.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.960]   The planes were new, we had a great experience.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.540]   It's a little bit of a discount airline,
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.900]   but I thought it was a good flight,
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.900]   so definitely would recommend that.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:20.280]   As for costs, when I just generally look right now,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.840]   from the West Coast, it looks like in coach,
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:26.100]   you can get down to as low as $700 or $800 round trip.
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.540]   On the East Coast, $400 to $500.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.660]   The best deals are gonna be on French B in coach.
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.180]   Then when it comes to business class,
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.620]   from the West Coast, $3,500 and up,
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.660]   on pretty much all the major airlines.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.100]   And from the East Coast, about $2,400 and up,
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.780]   with the best deals being on JetBlue and La Compagnie.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.020]   So let's talk briefly about miles and points though,
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.460]   because I think that is where there's some real magic,
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.500]   and I love to highlight how far your points can take you.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.480]   So I did a handful of searches
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.180]   just to get a good sense of this.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.640]   And looking at economy,
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.240]   there's a wide range of prices you can get.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.940]   So this is why I think it's really important
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.900]   to consider having flexible points,
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.740]   because if you just had points in a certain carrier,
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.460]   you're not gonna get the best deal.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.780]   For example, the absolute best deal right now
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.100]   to get to France in coach,
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.060]   you can do it on Air France for 15,000 points.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.340]   But because there's a 20% transfer bonus,
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.540]   if you transfer from Capital One to Air France,
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.600]   it's actually only 12,500 points in economy.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.540]   So definitely the best deal.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.020]   And one I'll highlight is that Air France is notorious
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.960]   for not sharing all of their availability to partners,
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.060]   and Delta is notorious for charging
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.660]   egregious amounts of points for flights.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.740]   So despite that on one single day,
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.100]   you could find a flight from Toronto to Paris
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.720]   for 15,000 miles on Air France,
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.500]   on Delta, the cheapest flight on that day was 105,000 miles.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.060]   So just a great example
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.180]   of why having transferable points can matter.
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:56.300]   In this case, if you only had Delta points,
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.760]   it would cost you seven times as many points
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.860]   for that single flight.
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.300]   But that's not the only option.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:06.060]   Virgin Atlantic had options for 15 to 22,000 points in coach,
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.480]   Air Canada for 33 to 40,000 points,
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.000]   but Avianca coming in at 25.5,000 points.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.260]   So just another example on the Star Alliance side,
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.940]   which is Air Canada, United, Avianca,
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.820]   sometimes booking with different carriers
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.880]   can get you a much better deal.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.580]   So that exact same flight
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.420]   that was 30 to 40,000 points on Air Canada,
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.420]   and probably even more on United,
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.600]   was only 25.5,000 on Avianca using their life miles,
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.340]   which you can also transfer to from certain programs.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.920]   Looking at premium economy,
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.600]   not too many airlines offer it,
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.480]   but I did find a few options.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.600]   Air France, about 30,000 points,
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.860]   Air Canada, 48,000 points,
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.700]   but there's actually a chase transfer bonus
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.020]   to Air Canada right now.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.160]   So you could drop 48,000 to 40,
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.360]   and there's that same capital one transfer
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.820]   to Air France for 20% more points.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:56.800]   So that 30,000 could be 25,000.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.940]   So some great transfer point opportunities right now.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.440]   But I know a lot of people are trying to look
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.020]   to get their points to take them in business class.
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.720]   So I looked at a few flights,
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.600]   both from Chicago and Los Angeles,
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.080]   surprisingly a lot more business class availability
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.440]   than I was expecting.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:15.200]   And it really, again, depends where you fly from.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.560]   So on the Star Alliance side,
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.000]   for the same flight, United was 80,000 points,
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.040]   Aeroplan was 70,000,
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.540]   but with that transfer bonus, it dropped to 59.
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.140]   And then Avianca with no transfer bonus was 63,000.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.300]   So I'm definitely a big fan of transferring your points
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.240]   to the Avianca Life Miles program,
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.600]   especially for Europe flights.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.980]   The deals are so great.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.580]   You can transfer to them from Citi,
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.460]   Capital One, and Membership Rewards.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.020]   Obviously, if you only have chase points,
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.180]   you can go to Air Canada,
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.660]   especially with that transfer bonus,
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.780]   it makes it the best deal.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.520]   For Air France, it was about 80,000 points
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.500]   to get to Europe in business class
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.820]   when you found the availability.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.420]   With 20% bonus right now,
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.200]   you can get it for about 67,000.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.480]   And I should say I'm a big fan
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.040]   of the Air France KLM Flying Blue program,
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.180]   especially for these long haul premium cabin redemptions.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.860]   They have really good award pricing for business class.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.540]   The program also has access to a lot more Air France
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.560]   and KLM space than other programs do.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.080]   So they make it really easy.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.580]   But also, every month, they have this promo rewards offer,
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:18.300]   and they do 20 to 50% discounts on select awards.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.580]   And so I definitely think every time that comes out,
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:24.440]   take a look and you might find some amazing deals.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.500]   And then one of the best options of all
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.060]   was using American miles.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.380]   If you have American miles,
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:31.860]   or if you have built points that can transfer there,
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.340]   57.5,000 points for business class.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:37.080]   The only thing to be aware of
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.380]   is if you're doing that flight
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:40.360]   and it's on an American flight,
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.980]   the taxes are significantly lower
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.260]   than if you're doing that flight
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.380]   and it's on a British Airways flight.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.080]   As much as I love British Airways
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.560]   and they have great planes and service and lounges,
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.680]   when you're on British Airways
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.120]   crossing the Atlantic Ocean,
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.200]   they charge an egregious amount of taxes and fees,
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.400]   sometimes as much as $800, $900 each way.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.640]   So definitely make sure that if you're looking
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.520]   on One World Flights,
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.880]   booking through something like American,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.320]   try to look for flights that are not on British Airways
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.360]   'cause you're gonna save a lot of money on taxes.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.240]   So that's flights.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.400]   Feel free to take a listen
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.720]   to the end of the episode we did on Italy.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.960]   There's a little bit of overlap,
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.240]   so there might be some extra content
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.500]   about flights to Europe,
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.480]   but let's move on to hotels.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.760]   There are an incredibly large number of options,
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.160]   over 200 hotels that you can book
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.000]   with either Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, or IHG points,
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.680]   really so many options.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.520]   So I won't go deep into all of them
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.680]   because at the end of the day,
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.520]   it really comes down to availability,
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.320]   but I will highlight a few amazing redemptions I saw
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.080]   just doing some quick searching.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.240]   And again, I was doing all of this searching
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.320]   using Aways, A-W-A-Y-Z.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.600]   It's a live cash and award pricer
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.620]   that really makes travel planning easy,
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:53.360]   that helps you get a great deal on hotels.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.600]   It factors in things like fifth night free.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.260]   It shows you the prices in points and dollars.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.760]   And one of the cool things is you can filter
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.640]   by either which chain you wanna look at,
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.540]   or you can filter by which points you have,
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.340]   whether they're Amex or Chase,
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.200]   or even specific hotel points,
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.040]   or whether you're even trying
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.680]   to use a free night certificate.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.200]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.560]   you get $10 off the premium annual plan
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.200]   every single year from now into the future.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.720]   And that's at allthehacks.com/aways, A-W-A-Y-Z.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.580]   They've launched a couple new things recently
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.000]   that I figure I'll share quickly.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.700]   One, they now have email award availability alerts.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:28.920]   So you can set alerts.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.480]   Hey, when this hotel opens up, let me know.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.720]   Then they also changed their pricing
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.000]   such that they have a free plan
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.640]   that lets you do a handful of searches early on
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.160]   just to get a feel for the product.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.400]   They have a trip pass if you're just planning a trip
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.360]   and wanna dive in.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.320]   And then again, if you're gonna be using this a lot
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.760]   like I am, they have an annual premium plan
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.320]   that you can get $10 off.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.460]   So I'll start with Hyatt.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.200]   They've got 47 hotels in France.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.960]   I'll start with a couple in Paris.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.600]   The Park Hyatt is absolutely amazing.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.960]   Talk about a deal.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.960]   I found it for 40,000 points a night available
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.320]   for a room that would otherwise be $2,065.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.120]   That means you're getting 5 cents per point,
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.840]   which is an excellent redemption.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.740]   Obviously, if you're booking in the Chase portal,
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.280]   you'd be getting at most 1 1/2 cents.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.860]   So great use of points.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.760]   And then also the Hotel de Louvre was 30,000 points,
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.520]   so a little less expensive, and $1,026 a night.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.360]   So not quite the same value, but less points.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.440]   Still getting almost 3 1/2 cents per point.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.240]   A bunch of other Hyatt options,
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.560]   especially some of these cool SLH,
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.000]   small luxury hotel properties they have.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.280]   Definitely worth taking a look.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.980]   And if you have Chase or BuiltPoints,
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.880]   you can easily transfer to Hyatt.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.600]   On Hilton, Hilton has 27 hotels in France,
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.040]   at least according to their website.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.000]   There are a ton, but I'll highlight two really cool ones.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.620]   One is the Waldorf Astoria in Versailles.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.900]   Really cool property, looks awesome.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.040]   I've never stayed there,
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.700]   but after doing a little bit of research,
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.360]   it seems like it would be an awesome time,
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.880]   especially if you don't wanna just make it a day trip.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.280]   Again, Hilton points are not the easiest
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.080]   to get a ton of value out of,
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.580]   but if you have those free night certificates,
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.120]   they can be a great use.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.320]   This hotel was 80,000 points on Hilton,
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.280]   but the cash rate was $500.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.220]   Even better deal was the Maison Astor in Paris.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:16.000]   It's a curio collection hotel.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.880]   It's 64,000 points a night on the nights I looked
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.160]   for a cash rate of $620,
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.400]   which means you're almost getting a cent per point,
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.960]   which I think the average valuation for Hilton points
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.040]   is close to half a cent.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.260]   So that's a pretty good deal there as well.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.800]   I can't remember if I was factoring in fifth night free
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.900]   for both of these stays, but if I wasn't,
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.080]   obviously that would go down
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.140]   if you booked a five night stay at either.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.520]   Not sure you'd wanna spend five nights down at Versailles,
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.840]   but maybe you would, but definitely in Paris, no problem.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.040]   On the Marriott front,
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.040]   there's 69 Marriott hotels across France.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.000]   For some reason it came up with a higher number,
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.700]   but it was showing ones in Geneva.
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:52.040]   I think 69 is the right number,
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.200]   but I'm not gonna bet on it.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.680]   Two properties that I thought looked really great
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.780]   that I would check out, especially for the deals.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:01.620]   The Prince de Galles is a luxury hotel collection in Paris,
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.520]   and I found it for 119,500 points a night.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.160]   So just shy of 120,000 points,
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.880]   but the cash rate was almost $2,000.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.000]   So this would be a way to get more than 1 1/2 cent
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.960]   per point value for Marriott, which is very rare.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.000]   Also fifth night free on Marriott
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.140]   if you wanna save a little.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.480]   But if you're not looking to spend
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.040]   120,000 Marriott points per night,
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.700]   the Renaissance Paris near the Eiffel Tower
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.760]   is only 52,000 points a night,
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.360]   and the cash rate on that hotel is about $543.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.380]   So you're still getting almost one cent per point there.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.480]   Good use for Marriott points.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.120]   Still not a good enough use
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.800]   that I would be transferring points to Marriott,
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.440]   or Hilton for that matter,
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.400]   unless I was just shy of a redemption
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.000]   and transferring those points got me to the redemption.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.800]   And the same is also true of IHG.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.160]   I just haven't found deals
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.080]   that make it worth transferring points
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   from Chase, Capua, and Amex to the hotel chains,
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.680]   except for Hyatt.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.600]   Man, Hyatt getting 3 1/2 to five cents per point
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.480]   is a really, really killer deal.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.780]   So I will transfer Chase points to Hyatt
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.440]   for redemptions all the time.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.600]   On the rest, I don't not like using those points.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.800]   I have a Marriott card, I have a Hilton card,
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.840]   and I'm earning points when I stay at those hotels
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.600]   and using them for those properties.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.640]   I'm just not transferring the points there
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.120]   from other credit card programs.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.080]   On the IHG front, I didn't find any amazing deals,
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.980]   but a couple hotels worth looking at.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.840]   The Hotel Indigo and the Kempton Saint HonorÃ©
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.200]   looked wonderful,
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.880]   but another property that wasn't as high on the luxury tier
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.840]   was the Crown Plaza in Paris at RÃ©publique,
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.560]   which I will just flag was where we stayed
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.440]   and an incredible part of town.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.140]   So much great food, so walkable.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.480]   So if I had IHG points,
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.040]   I found that for 44,000 points a night,
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.280]   definitely something I'd consider using.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.200]   Speaking of Kempton, the Kempton chain,
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.840]   which is a part of IHG,
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.360]   has this interesting thing where they create passwords.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.960]   And if you use the password when you check in,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.600]   which always feels a little bit strange,
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.000]   you get some kind of perks,
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   whether it's free parking, free breakfast,
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.840]   free drinks, free snacks.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.880]   And so the password, at least until September 3rd,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.480]   is no shade.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.320]   So if you're checking in to a Kempton hotel,
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.360]   don't forget to say no shade at check-in
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.360]   to get yourself some perks, at least through September.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.840]   After that, you might wanna Google around
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.320]   and see if you can find the new password at the time.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.200]   Finally, there is another chain I'll mention,
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.580]   two of them actually, the Choice Hotel chain.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.820]   They've got 20 hotels in France.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.020]   They're all quality hotel, comfort hotel, or comfort suites.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.280]   Definitely nothing fancy and luxurious,
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.920]   but definitely good options if you have choice points.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.600]   Still not sure I would transfer.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.960]   And then the Accor chain has a massive coverage,
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.660]   all of Europe, tons of hotels.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.440]   But the way their points program works
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.520]   is you just get a fixed 2.2 cents of value per point.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.280]   If you already have Accor points, great.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.200]   If you're staying at Accor properties,
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.200]   absolutely I would be making sure you're earning points.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.000]   But when you look to transfer from Capital One,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.720]   it's two Capital One points for every one point at Accor.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:05.520]   So to get a point, you're gonna need to give up two.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.760]   And so you're really just getting
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.760]   about that same one cent per value.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.900]   Technically, it's 1.1 cents,
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.200]   but I think your points can go a lot further than that.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.400]   So I wouldn't look at Choice or Accor,
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.380]   really any of these chains except Hyatt,
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.040]   as the best options for transferring points to,
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.160]   unless you find really a diamond in the rough redemption,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.380]   which is possible.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.180]   But if you have points in those programs,
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:27.600]   there are a lot of great options,
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.440]   and hopefully you can find something really great.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.000]   Just to wrap for a quick fun thing,
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.040]   we're talking about France.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.720]   If you heard last week's episode,
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.720]   Amy and I are trying to figure out
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.340]   where to go on this trip we have.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.560]   We did finally pull the trigger on French Polynesia,
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.360]   so we will get to practice some French.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.480]   We technically, I guess,
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.760]   legally are going to a domiciled part of France.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.840]   So I guess that'll qualify for mentioning in this episode.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.160]   But we haven't actually figured out
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.960]   the hotel situation yet, which we leave in three days.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.280]   So hopefully by the next time I talk about that trip,
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.840]   I will let you know what we ended up doing,
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.920]   because not having a hotel is just not an option.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.180]   So I'm sure it'll be amazing,
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.080]   but really cutting it to the wire here,
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.200]   which I think I kind of enjoy.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.440]   And as I get older,
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.080]   I'm kind of realizing is not as enjoyable as it used to be.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.280]   But thank you so much for listening this far.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.500]   I hope you're inspired for your next trip to France.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:15.280]   I know I am, and I will see you next week.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:20.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.020]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:33.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
