[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.400]   And in this episode, I want to talk about the trauma of remodeling a home.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.500]   Because we discussed in a previous episode some of the wins
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.800]   and some of the regrets we had since the pandemic began.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800]   And a reader pointed out a huge win they had during the pandemic,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.500]   which was buying a fixer and then remodeling it during the entire time.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.400]   And this is something that we also did.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.600]   We bought a fixer in 2019.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.100]   We finished stage one, which was remodeling a kitchen and three bathrooms.
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.300]   In 2019, we lived in it for like 10 months.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.900]   And we started phase two, which was blowing out the ground floor,
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.100]   trying to add in 300 more square footage,
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.600]   bedroom, living room, laundry room, hallway, closet, and rewiring.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.500]   And it was a big project.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.800]   And ultimately, because it took longer than expected,
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.300]   I thought it was going to take, I don't know, four to six months, right?
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.500]   But four to six months in, it was like only 10% of the way done, it seemed like.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.600]   And then there was a stalling out.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.300]   And so ultimately, the project took two and a half years to complete.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.100]   It started at the beginning of 2020.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.300]   And I remember we got our final, final permit
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.700]   for the downstairs demo and rebuild, as well as the deck,
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.600]   something like August 8, 2022.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.000]   Something like that, yeah.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.200]   So after doing a huge remodel that took two and a half years,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   it cost, I think, something like $130,000, $40,000.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.900]   It took a lot of time dealing with our contractor,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.300]   who disappeared for multiple times, multiple months on end,
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.200]   failing some permits, such as one of the building or plumbing
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.800]   or electrical permits, cost overruns, all that.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.300]   I completely wiped it from my memory.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.500]   When I spent hours putting together the post,
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.400]   the pandemic was an experience in hedging your life.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.700]   So this tells me that remodeling is very stressful, is very traumatic.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.800]   And I wiped it out of my mind because I didn't
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500]   want to think about it anymore.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.100]   I remember finishing.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.000]   I felt really proud that I got through this gauntlet of pain.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   But then I swore that I would never do a gut remodel again.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.200]   I don't know if I would ever even do a simple bathroom remodel again.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.700]   Do you remember that time?
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.500]   Yes, I remember.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.700]   I was very fortunate that you shouldered pretty much 99.9%
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.900]   of the load of that remodel.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.500]   So I wasn't too involved.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.700]   But oh my gosh, it was a lot of stress for you.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500]   And it was just so painful because our contractor was so MIA.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.900]   So the communication and just feeling so many unknowns, I think,
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.200]   was one of the biggest aspects of the stress for you.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400]   Yeah, he would never give us a clear idea of how much it would cost.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.100]   Costs and then what was going on with the permits,
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.700]   what was going on with the supplies.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.100]   It was just endless unknowns.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   It was basically because people had to continuously rely on other people.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.700]   And if one chain breaks or becomes undependable,
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.300]   then it's all screwed up.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.800]   And I think it's especially frustrating for some people who remodel
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.500]   complicated projects.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.700]   But ours wasn't that complicated.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.200]   It was within the envelope of the home.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.400]   Because you have to deal with the Department of Building Inspection,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   which over the pandemic period has shown multiple stances of corruption in San Francisco.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.000]   So much. It's crazy.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.200]   So much corruption.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.600]   I mean, we've got like, you can get an expediter
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.500]   who's supposed to know the system better.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.700]   You just pay them more.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.300]   And gee, where does some of that money go?
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.600]   Maybe to pay one of the inspectors or people who's approving the plans.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500]   I mean, this has happened over and over again for years.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.000]   Scandals. Countless candles in the DBI.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   Scandals. Yeah.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.000]   So it's one thing, right, if the city...
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.600]   You know, okay, one time I got a notice that said we had to remove our planter boxes
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   because they were too high and they were on the public right-of-way.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.300]   And I had no idea what that was.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.200]   Now, I put planter boxes in front of our house on our property.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.800]   But the city said, "If you don't remove these planter boxes within 30 days,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600]   we're going to fine you because the public has the right-of-way to step on your property."
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.800]   Yeah, it's the dumbest rule.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.700]   So I was like, "Are you kidding me? 30 days?
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.500]   Just give me at least 60 days because, you know, it costs thousands of dollars to build and remove
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.800]   and you're crushing the aesthetics of the home and neighborhood."
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.500]   So they said, "Fine. 60 days."
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.200]   At the same time, the reason why they came out was because I think a neighbor complained
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.900]   that one of the sidewalks was buckling because of the tree roots.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.700]   Now, that's kind of common.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.500]   And I think several years ago, there was a law that passed that said
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.000]   the city was going to take care of all the sidewalks due to, you know, tree roots and so forth.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.200]   But that was a year ago.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.800]   So why does the city impose a 30-day deadline and then fine us if we don't meet that deadline,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.300]   yet they can take a year or more?
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.600]   It reminds me of when we were living in a different house.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.200]   There was a pothole in the middle of a busy intersection that we could hear because it was loose.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.400]   And we called and called and called and filed so many, like, tickets to get that thing fixed.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.700]   Yeah. It took a year and a half.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.800]   It took a year and a half.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.400]   Yeah, it was almost like a... I just put a calendar reminder.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.100]   Once a week.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.900]   Call in.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.500]   Call 311. Call the city.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.000]   It was so noisy. It'd wake us up at night. I remember.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.800]   Yeah. So that's the thing.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.900]   And this is one of the reasons why, oh, man, the government, local government, big government
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.700]   is often so inefficient, especially compared to private citizens who tend to get things done.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.900]   There's this frustration here.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.000]   And this frustration will definitely show itself whenever you try to remodel a home.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.700]   So for those of you who want to remodel a property or buy a fixer and expand it and all that,
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.200]   just know that it's stressful as hell.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.400]   And I don't recommend you do it unless you're in your 20s or 30s, maybe early 40s.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.800]   But after 45, your time is too valuable because you're probably wealthier and you make more money.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   And your mental health is more important.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.500]   It might be more frail because you've gone through much more of life's ups and downs.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.100]   So do it in your 20s and 30s.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.900]   Put in that sweat equity because you're earning less.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.600]   Your time is less valuable.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.000]   You have more time and you're making less money.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.400]   And then after 45, it's like, okay, you've gone through like the ringer, the torture.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.100]   You appreciate larger remodeled homes.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.900]   I think you just buy fully redone homes after that.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.200]   So one of the implications of the pain of remodeling, especially since the pandemic began,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   is that people like me will not sell our remodeled properties, a rental or primary home, at a discount whatsoever.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.100]   We have too much invested in it.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   And, you know, selling a home and buying a home is very, very emotional.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.100]   So because of that emotion and all that time I spent, there is no way I'm selling my home at a discount.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.900]   I'm not selling the property in this market if it's a little bit soft.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.900]   Even in a raging bull market, it's like, you got to pay me a big premium.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:39.400]   And I think this type of attitude will multiply across the entire homeowner industry,
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.500]   and which will result in fully remodeled homes appreciating more.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.400]   The gap will—people pay up more.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.600]   And for us, for our next home, I am willing to pay a little bit more for a fully redone home
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.400]   because I went through the experience and know how much it takes to get through the gauntlet.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.600]   So I appreciate that more.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.100]   Therefore, I'm willing to pay more.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.800]   One thing I want to add, a thought that you had recently as well,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.400]   is that if we are shopping in the future, you know, hopefully way in the future,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   anyway, if it comes time to shop for another house, yes, we want one that's fully redone.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.200]   However, we don't want one that was just finished.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.100]   And tell the readers why.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.200]   Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   So just like buying a new car in the first year of a redesign or remodel,
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.600]   you shouldn't—I don't think you should buy a home, a brand new home,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.800]   unless you have a two-year warranty or longer that covers everything.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.600]   Because whenever you redesign something, especially if you do a lot of custom work,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.900]   man, there are so many things that can go wrong.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.200]   And the more customized you make your home, sometimes the rarer the parts.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.300]   And the rarer the parts, the longer the delays and the cost overruns and so forth.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   So there can be a lot of things that can go wrong.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:13.000]   So if you buy a home after maybe three terrible winters or terrible summers with tornadoes and all that,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   you can kind of get a sense of how well the home holds up.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.200]   Because if you buy a brand new home that hasn't been tested by the elements
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.400]   or, you know, the guts haven't been working long enough, bad things could happen.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.000]   Several readers have written in and said, you know, they paid for a brand new home
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.200]   and it resulted in several leaks, they had to move out, huge cost to fix the homes,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.800]   litigation as well, moving out of that home and renting another home.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.400]   The thing is, even if you hire the top contractor,
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.800]   the most expensive architect to create an amazing new home or remodel amazing home,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.400]   something always goes wrong.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.600]   Because you can have the best from the top,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.200]   but who is building it with their hands and knees and fingers?
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.800]   The people who are not making the top dollar,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.600]   they're the subcontractors and then, you know, the workers of the subcontractors, right?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.400]   So unless you're completely focused on what they do every single day, you inspect the work,
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.800]   shortcuts will be made all the time.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.400]   I've seen it many, many times.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:23.200]   Like one example, we did a shower and then the worker forgot to put the rubber shower pan.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.400]   That's waterproofing.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.600]   Some kind of lining.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.400]   Yeah, which is totally important.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.600]   And thankfully, the inspector came and said, where's the rubber shower pan lining?
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.200]   Oh, sorry, I forgot.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.800]   And then they redid it.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.200]   So that's another actually point about remodeling with permits.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   It's going to be super painful to remodel with permits,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   but they'll protect you from doing crappy work.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.300]   So for all y'all who remodeled successfully during the pandemic,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.800]   congratulations actually, because we were able to utilize a really crappy time
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.900]   to increase the value of our homes.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.300]   And if you expanded the livable square footage of your home,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.500]   that's the way, that's the best way to increase the value of your home.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.400]   Because if you can build for lower than the selling price, then you're winning instantly.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   For example, I think we spent maybe around 300,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.700]   $325 a square foot to build a brand new space,
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.600]   but the home should sell for about $1,000 a square foot.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.400]   So that's instant value creation.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.100]   So tell yourself that when you are remodeling,
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.900]   hopefully when you're expanding,
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.600]   because that is one of the best ways to help you get through a very difficult time period.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.000]   I remember telling myself during the worst time of the remodeling process
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.700]   to just keep on going, just gut it out.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.800]   It's just like writing or building something or starting a podcast or writing a book.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.600]   If you can just keep on going, everything will be okay.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.100]   During the process, it's terrible.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.700]   But now that the process is done, I feel happy that it's done, right?
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   The return on remodeling starts growing the longer you own your home.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.500]   I say this specifically from a remodeled rental property point of view.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.800]   If you can remodel the property, expand the space or make it nicer,
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.700]   you can charge more rent and then you take the annual rent divided by the remodeling cost.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.300]   And I would say there's a good chance it could be 10%,
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.800]   which is the average return of the S&P 500.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.300]   So the longer you can hold that remodeled rental property,
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.800]   the greater the return, the absolute return for sure.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   But there's also a point where after about maybe 20 years, 20-25 years,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.300]   the remodeled property could start feeling dated.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.100]   And that's when you might have to go through the entire remodeling process again.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.700]   So yes, remodeling our rental property was a big win for us during the pandemic.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.100]   It was another screw you to the pandemic,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.900]   just like writing a book was a screw you to the pandemic.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.300]   If anybody asked us, what did we do during that time?
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.000]   But if you plan to remodel with a significant other,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.300]   especially, make sure your relationship is strong.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.200]   Give each other hall passes.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.000]   I forgive you passes, reset buttons,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.200]   because the remodeling process will test your patience and also test the relationships of the people who are closest to you.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.700]   Thanks so much everyone for listening.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.100]   If you enjoyed this podcast, we'd love a positive five-star review.
