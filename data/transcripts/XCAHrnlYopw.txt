[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   - All right, next question's from Bo, a 38 year old teacher.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.360]   I'm not big on social media,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.620]   but as an independent researcher in the humanities,
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.540]   I use academia.edu and ResearchGate
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.720]   mainly to get access to papers.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.900]   I also have a Twitter and a LinkedIn account
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.560]   mainly to share my blog posts
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.520]   and see if I can find an audience.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.400]   Is this the right balance?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.600]   - Right, there's a good case study of our discussion
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.800]   from the deep dive earlier in the show.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.060]   So not knowing too much about specifically
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.240]   what type of research you do or your career,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.760]   let's just give some random recommendations here.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.120]   Paying for access to academic articles is a no brainer
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760]   if you are an academic who's not associated
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.400]   with an institution that gives you that access, so of course.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.020]   Twitter, I don't think you need to be there.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.000]   We just talked about this.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.180]   Twitter gives you this illusion
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.520]   that it's gonna grant you a virality
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.600]   that will grow your audience bigger
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.540]   than if you hadn't had Twitter.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.600]   I would say, forget it, just produce really good work.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.080]   Twitter may work on your behalf.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.520]   People may share your work on there
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.040]   and you need to have a platform you own
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.660]   to capture that attention,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.860]   but putting your attention in the content production
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.640]   on Twitter is going to open you up to all these negatives
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.760]   and dilute the positives you get from your own platform.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.300]   LinkedIn, I guess it just depends what you're doing on it.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.200]   So for LinkedIn to be effective,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.720]   A, you have to ignore the sort of increasing social features
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.520]   slash streaming distraction features
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180]   and just focus on the core original ability
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.840]   to use it to look at tertiary network connections.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.740]   I mean, the value of LinkedIn,
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.140]   the unique value proposition of LinkedIn
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140]   is I can look at people
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.780]   who are in the network of people I know.
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.340]   So not secondary, but tertiary connections.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100]   That's really useful, right?
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   So you say, okay, I need a connection to the movie industry.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.380]   I don't know anyone in the movie industry,
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.740]   but I probably know someone
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.780]   who knows someone in the movie industry.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.020]   That person can make a recommendation on my behalf.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560]   And so it opens up contacts.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.320]   And because you have an intermediary
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.600]   who knows both ends of this link,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.340]   that's actually a high quality contact.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.660]   If you go out one more layer, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.240]   So if it's, I know someone who knows someone
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.720]   who knows someone in the movie industry,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.160]   that connection doesn't work
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.740]   because there's no person in common
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.820]   between you and the ultimate person you wanna talk to.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.620]   So I remember my longtime friend, Ben Kastnoka,
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.780]   who used to be Reed Hoffman's chief of staff.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.500]   I remember him at the time
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.780]   when LinkedIn was really taking off,
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.500]   explaining this network theory to me.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.540]   It's all about the sweet spot of your friends' friends
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.620]   is the sweet spot of opening yourself up
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.460]   to a huge amount of potential connections
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.500]   while still having the ability
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.840]   to make those connections strong.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.620]   So if your work is such that as an independent researcher,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.460]   you need contracts or engagements with clients
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.100]   in various type of industries,
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.920]   and you need connections to people in those industries,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.220]   that aspect of LinkedIn could be very valuable.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.140]   So I would summarize this, I guess, as saying,
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.440]   yes, to paying money to gain access to articles,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.040]   no to Twitter, maybe yes to LinkedIn if you really need it.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.100]   Now, there's a bigger point here
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.060]   that I made in a New York Times op-ed
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.540]   that came out in 2016,
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.900]   and it actually generated a lot of furor at the time.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.660]   But I wrote this New York Times op-ed where I said,
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.660]   "We overestimate the value of social media presence
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.780]   "in getting noticed and succeeding in your career."
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.220]   And I say, "We are forgetting the fact
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.120]   "that these platforms are very new,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.040]   "and most industries have been around for a very long time.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   "Twitter was not used at a high rate until 2012 or 2014."
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.260]   So when I was writing that op-ed,
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.860]   this is a few years ago.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.380]   Before that, all these industries still existed.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.980]   People still got noticed, got hired,
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.140]   grew reputations, grew really big careers,
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.480]   and they did this all without Twitter followers.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.380]   And they did this all
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.800]   without being an influencer on Instagram.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.200]   So presumably, these bespoke methods
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.260]   by which your work is noticed and rewarded
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.420]   still exist in most fields that have been around
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.580]   for more than just a handful of years.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.100]   So don't ignore those.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.600]   In fact, if you ignore those and say,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.500]   "I'm gonna invent my own way to get noticed
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.900]   "and succeed in my field based on social media,"
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.980]   you're taking a huge risk.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.060]   You need to pay less attention to your Twitter followers
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.860]   and say, "In my particular field,
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.740]   "I'm this independent researcher in humanities
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.520]   "who makes my money this way,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.940]   "how do people traditionally get noticed and succeed?"
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.940]   Almost all of those channels are still there.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.540]   Social media's rise,
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.100]   which is only still just a decade old at this point
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.780]   of any sort of widespread adoption,
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.140]   has not gotten rid of existing channels
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.780]   of getting noticed and succeeding.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.720]   And so I keep coming back to that with people.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.340]   How do people traditionally get noticed
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.180]   and succeed in your field?
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.300]   And usually it involves producing really good stuff,
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.580]   and it's really hard.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.380]   It has nothing to do with virality
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.780]   or having large follower counts.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.140]   And it's almost always that's gonna be the answer.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.140]   And so until you have a really good answer to that question,
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.700]   forget about new tools
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.820]   are gonna somehow give you a shortcut.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.580]   Now, when I wrote that op-ed in 2016,
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.180]   that caused a lot of problems.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.740]   This was right before the mainstream
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.980]   had turned against social media.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.780]   So the political right in America
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.260]   had turned against social media at this point
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.100]   because they were worried about being censored.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.220]   But the political center and left in America
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.020]   was still very laudatory towards social media
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.420]   at this point when that came out.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.760]   And so me standing up and saying,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.200]   "Social media is not as important
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.660]   "as you think for your career.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.820]   "You should maybe ignore that
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.900]   "and focus on the fundamentals."
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.260]   It was considered a heretical,
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.740]   almost certifiable thing to say.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.940]   It really upset people.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.940]   It was, "Whoa, no, no, no.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.320]   "Social media is the key.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.580]   "It's how you get noticed.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.980]   "It's how you circumvent all of these gatekeepers.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.740]   "It's how you build up movements."
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.420]   I mean, there was so much pushback, really surprised me.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.860]   And I've talked about this on the show before,
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.340]   but the New York Times commissioned the next week
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.580]   a response op-ed.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.500]   They got the social media manager of monster.com,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.660]   Patrick someone, Patrick Gilroy,
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.700]   to write a response op-ed to mine and say,
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.000]   "This is crazy, don't listen to this.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.040]   "A lot of articles were written in response to mine.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.360]   "This is crazy, don't listen to this.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.900]   "I had hostile radio interviews."
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.500]   We're like, "How can you believe this?"
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.100]   Now I understand this mechanism
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.740]   because we see it all the time in 2022, 2023.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.660]   We see this all the time.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.100]   Where is the fiercest pushback generated?
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.240]   This sort of, when you get these type
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.860]   of big pylons generated.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.260]   It's not when someone comes from left field
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.620]   from the completely other team and throw some rocks.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.740]   You're used to that.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.340]   It's when someone who you feel like is in
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.780]   or close to your tribe pushes a little bit to the edge.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.900]   Then it seemed a little bit more like heresy
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.360]   and that has to be policed.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.700]   So if, you know, in 2016,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.620]   Jaron Lanier stands up and says, "Social media is nonsense."
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.780]   People like, "Yeah, that's Jaron Lanier.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.340]   "I mean, he's like kind of crazy and brilliant.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.780]   "And this is what he's been saying for a long time.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.860]   "And we know it, it's not a big deal."
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.860]   But if a computer scientist comes out and says that,
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.300]   someone who is in sort of mainstream thought,
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.080]   someone who has some influence with an audience,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.620]   someone who's sort of a part of that sort
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.300]   of mainstream centrist or leftist inner tribe
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.160]   comes out and says, "I don't think that's that important."
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.340]   You have to fiercely, at the time,
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.420]   you had to fiercely police that
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.340]   to prevent the Overton window from shifting away
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.220]   from the direction you wanted to shift.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.820]   So it was an interesting example
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.460]   of what became much more prevalent
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.780]   in the years that followed.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.380]   The sort of policing of views.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.180]   And this became increasingly political after a while.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.660]   So the left and the right would do this
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.060]   on political hot topics, but this was less political,
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.380]   but it was just more,
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.260]   there's this mainstream intellectual thought
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.580]   that social media was this powerful force
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.460]   that toppled dictators and helped Barack Obama get elected.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.780]   And it was very meaningful, important.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.060]   And so if you're involved
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.660]   in this sort of mainstream intellectual life,
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.340]   they did not like someone
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.940]   starting to veer off the reservation.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.140]   Now everyone's like, "Of course."
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.500]   Yeah, everyone agrees with it now, but it was interesting.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.340]   So it was like an early mild pile on,
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.820]   but it showed a general internet dynamic
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.340]   that I think has really strengthened ever since then.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.100]   - So you wrote that before the Like button
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.220]   got introduced, right?
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.580]   - Like, no, the Like button actually got introduced earlier.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.420]   - Oh, okay.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.140]   - Yeah, so the Like button got introduced
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.620]   like 2007 or eight or something like that.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.460]   - Oh, right, right, right.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.340]   - Yeah.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.260]   Yeah, the interesting thing was when I wrote that,
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.740]   it was right, so the turning point
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.380]   in the mainstream intellectual thought on social media
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.220]   was Donald Trump getting elected.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.660]   And that's ultimately what turned it
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.620]   is the shift from Facebook helping Barack Obama
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.260]   to Facebook helping Trump shifted, I think,
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.460]   the reception of social media.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.980]   And it opened up like a lot more skepticism
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.140]   and hostility towards the platform from the center and left.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.700]   The hostility from the right was already there.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.100]   I started hearing that like 2015.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.060]   So that was already there.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.220]   But from the center and the left,
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.860]   that was after the Trump election.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.820]   But it wasn't immediate because that op-ed,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.300]   that op-ed came out in the Sunday in the New York Times
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.580]   in the Week in Review,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.740]   the Sunday after Donald Trump was elected.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.660]   So it wasn't an immediate response.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.580]   I mean, it was a Week in Review section
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.580]   that was that and like a bunch of political stuff.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.460]   And then the next week they had the follow-up, right?
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.020]   So in the first, the last months of 2016,
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.340]   early months of 2017,
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.020]   there still was a general positive consensus on social media.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.380]   It wasn't really till the Cambridge Analytica
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.100]   and the Russian disinformation stories.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.380]   When those really took off,
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.340]   which was more after Trump was in office in 2017,
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.540]   that's when you began to see the shift.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.340]   So I know it's an interesting time point.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.100]   So really the shift towards universal negativity
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.820]   towards social media was probably
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.980]   first or second quarter of 2017.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.620]   If not all the way around,
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.740]   you had to get all the way to like 2018 really
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.500]   before people were on board.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.900]   But then by the time I was promoting
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.180]   digital minimalism in 2019,
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.100]   the pushback I was getting from reporters is like,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.100]   why aren't you pushing for even harder,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.420]   regulations and shutting down these companies?
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.260]   So I mean, man, that thing flipped.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.460]   That thing flipped hard.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.460]   [MUSIC]
