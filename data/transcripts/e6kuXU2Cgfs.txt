[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Ian in Greensboro, North Carolina asks this, "Pastor John, as I've explored
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Reformed theology over the past couple of years, I've learned quite a bit about
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   the practices of infant baptism and believers baptism, and why genuine
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Christians differ theologically here. While I'm an advocate of believers
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   baptism, one accusation I've found troubling is that because we Baptists
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   don't consider our unconverted children as official participants in the New
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Covenant, we are therefore treating them like pagan children, excluded from the
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Covenant community. As a Baptist, how do you respond to this charge? And further,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   how should yet unsaved children of believers be viewed by the Church?"
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Before I say something positive about the way we should view our children, "we"
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   meaning we Baptists, let's make sure that we realize that both Baptists and
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Reformed pedobaptists—and I'm not talking here about those who believe in
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   baptismal regeneration, but just those who are Reformed pedobaptists or others
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   who don't believe in baptismal new birth—we all have the same basic problem
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   in how to think about our children, and the difference lies in terminology. Now
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   they may not like it when I say this, but I'll say it anyway. In order for Reformed
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   pedobaptists—baptized babies—to say that children are members of the Covenant
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   community, they must define "Covenant community" so as not to necessarily mean
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   only the elect, called, regenerate, heaven-bound saints. They have to define
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   "Covenant community" so as to allow for the possibility in that Covenant
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   community members who are not elect, not born again. Now it's just as impossible
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   therefore for a pedobaptist parent to be sure that his child is elect as it is
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   for a Baptist parent. Pedobaptists may feel better about themselves by labeling
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   the child a Covenant member, but those children have no better standing before
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   God than the children of Baptists. Which brings me now to say something
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   positive about what really does make a difference—not labels, but does make a
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   difference—in how children stand before God in both groups. I can imagine a
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   pedobaptist parent feeling good that his child is a member of the Covenant with
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   God, but at the same time neglecting to pray for the child, neglecting to feed
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   the child morning, noon, and night on the Word of God, neglecting to model before
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   the child the joy of the Lord. In other words, there's no necessary correlation
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   between calling a child a Covenant member and giving a child what the child
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   needs to become a Covenant member.
