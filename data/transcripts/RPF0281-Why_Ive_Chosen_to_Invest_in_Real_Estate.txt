[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.840]   Today on Radical Personal Finance we talk investing.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.160]   I'm going to give you my investment story and tell you why I have decided to become
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.080]   a real estate investor and what I intend to do about it.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.480]   Hopefully you can laugh a little at my experiences and learn a little bit and possibly develop
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320]   your own investment strategy that is exactly right for you.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:14.600]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.440]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.200]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.160]   I love talking investing and I thoroughly enjoy real estate.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.800]   Take from today's show advice.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.040]   Do take some ideas though and then go and seek the advice that you need to build your
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.800]   own investment plan.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.440]   Pretty excited to talk to you today about real estate investing.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.820]   I've tried to be, you know, this show Radical Personal Finance is a mix.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.100]   It's a mix of advice.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.360]   It's a mix of stories.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.220]   It's also a mix of my story.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.320]   And I don't claim to, it's not all about my story, but I do try to share with you some,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.760]   at least some of what I'm personally doing and my personal approach.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.880]   It's always frankly really tough to know how much to share.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'm a pretty private guy.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.880]   I like privacy.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.760]   But yet I've decided to take kind of a public role here and share a lot of details about
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.440]   my life.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.320]   Sometimes I lie awake at night and I say, "Why on earth do I tell people what I'm doing
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   with my money?"
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.680]   Or, "Why on earth do I let people into my family life?"
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   Because it's a little scary.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.320]   I'm a pretty private guy.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.840]   But I think my reason for doing it is just to try to show that you don't have to be an
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.640]   extraordinary person in order to do some things.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.880]   What often happens, what frustrates me is many times gurus and popular personalities
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.800]   paint everything as easy.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.440]   And you only see them after the fact.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.520]   You only see them after their big successes.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.400]   You only see them after they're multi-millionaires.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.960]   You don't get to see the process.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.240]   So I try to share a little bit of the process, share some of the things I do know or that
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.880]   I can teach, but also share some of the journey.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.960]   And so today we're going to do that.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.160]   Today's show is going to be in three major parts.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.080]   Part one is going to be my investment story about kind of what I actually know about,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.200]   what I've actually pursued for my own personal investments.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   And then part two is going to be what I'm looking for in investment opportunities for
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.480]   me, for my life, what I'm looking for.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.080]   And then part three is going to be what is my strategy and plan as regards my real estate
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.680]   investment plan going forward.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.880]   So if those topics seem interesting to you, I hope you enjoy this content.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.600]   Let's begin with my story.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.060]   In many ways, I think my story would be similar to many of you who are listening in terms
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.800]   of what I've invested in, what I've learned along the way.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.360]   I've always been interested in money.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   I don't know why.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.240]   I can't explain exactly what.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.000]   Probably I just wanted to be rich.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   You know, a little of that lust for money is probably at the foundation of it.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.360]   But I've always been fascinated by money.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.120]   And I've always had the benefit of being the youngest child.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.020]   And as the youngest child, I'm the youngest of seven children.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.660]   And one of the big benefits of being a youngest child is you can learn from the experiences
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.720]   and mistakes of other people.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   Now I don't know whether this was causation or correlation, but I always tried to watch
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.760]   what my siblings did and did well and copy those things and what they did poorly and
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.800]   avoid some of those things.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.320]   And somehow along the way, I think due to the fact that I was educated at home through
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.960]   seventh grade, I realized that just I like to learn.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.780]   And I didn't have to face the meat grinder that many people face of school where your
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.460]   love of learning is just hammered out of you and you become a listless fish flopping around
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.620]   saying I'm not interested in anything.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.980]   I never had that problem.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.860]   I had enough time to engage with my surroundings and realize that I could learn about things
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.740]   I cared about when I was younger, that by the time I did go into a formal school environment,
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.340]   I was able to maintain my love of learning.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.840]   And once I realized that I could learn anything I needed to learn in order to achieve whatever
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.160]   kind of a result I wanted to achieve, it was, I mean, it opened my eyes.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.000]   It was a life-changing revelation.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.560]   When you understand that you're not stuck with who you are, but you can change and you
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   can learn and you can adapt and you can build new skills and you can learn new things, I
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.760]   mean, that changes everything because it means you're not stuck.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.560]   You're not stuck in life.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.080]   And so I know for me that was a big, big deal.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.120]   I think in many ways it's that love of learning that causes people to, or that realization
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.700]   that you can change things that causes people to become interested in money.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.180]   And so I was interested in money and I started reading.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.360]   I read books on finance and I read books on investing.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.280]   I dabbled here and there with my reading in different topics of investing, but I was always
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.160]   drawn more to the question of the personal finance discussions.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:15.120]   I've always found that to be more of my interest than the tactics and specific strategies of
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.980]   investing.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.800]   And so when I was 18, I knew two things.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.440]   I wanted to build my financial foundation and I needed to invest.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.120]   I had read enough personal finance books.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.680]   I didn't have a lot of money earlier.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.440]   I didn't know quite what to do with it.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.200]   So I knew I needed to open a Roth IRA.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.920]   So on my 18th birthday, I sat down at the kitchen table and I filled out a credit card
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.480]   at two credit card applications to start building my credit score because I'd read the personal
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.040]   finance books on how to build your credit score.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.800]   I knew exactly how to do it.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   And I also opened my first investment account.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.780]   USAA at that time, which was my bank I had banked with for years, was offering mutual
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.120]   funds that you could invest in with a starting transfer of $25 a month.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.480]   And so that was what I did.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.680]   I opened a Roth IRA and I started putting $25 a month into a USAA mutual fund.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.840]   I was very proud of myself and probably rightly so.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.520]   I was doing some things better than some other people.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.500]   Well, I was interested in different things, but I didn't really become seriously interested
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.120]   in real estate until I went to a seminar when I was in college.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.520]   A buddy of mine, his dad was a real estate agent and he was a real estate agent.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.440]   And so they invited me to go to a motivational seminar with them down in Miami, Florida.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   We went down.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   It was one of these big ones.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.480]   They worked out the American Airlines Arena in downtown Miami with a one-day motivational
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   seminar.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.680]   And the way these things work is if you ever get an invitation to go, they're good, but
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.660]   you got to be aware of what's going on.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.040]   They bring a bunch of really quality speakers together in the room and each of the speakers
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   will give a presentation.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.140]   It might be an hour, hour and a half.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.920]   And they're supposed to do a good job with their talk.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:02.380]   And then at the end, they have an opportunity to sell from the stage and to sell the next
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.640]   step if you're interested in their topic.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:13.880]   Well, I was entranced by the real estate guy who was giving his presentation from the stage
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.620]   talking about the financial independence that could be built with real estate and how great
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.740]   his life was and how they were offering another seminar.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.960]   So I went to the next seminar and I don't know if I paid for it or if it were free.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.780]   If I paid for it, it wasn't much.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:34.480]   But that three-day seminar was a really important seminar for me.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.380]   Number one, I was sure that I was going to become a multimillionaire in about the next
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.860]   two years based upon what I learned in that seminar.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.640]   It was a seminar that was put on by – they're bankrupt now – but it was a guy named Russ
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.080]   Whitney who was a real estate investor guru based out of Orlando, Florida.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.540]   And he was put on these seminars and he had his teachers teaching.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:04.580]   And in retrospect now, I've learned a little bit more, but it was a masterful psychological
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:10.780]   presentation, carefully designed to stimulate that lust for money, to stimulate the buying
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.980]   desire and to stimulate all of our desires, but to teach us a little bit about real estate
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.980]   as well.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.500]   I was intrigued, so just amazed by what I learned.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   I learned you could buy real estate with no money down.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.900]   I learned how you could invest in real estate with other people's money.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.020]   I learned how leverage worked.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.380]   I learned how I could get rich in just a couple of years without much hard work.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.620]   And I was so impressed by it.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.380]   I was so motivated and enthusiastic to continue on.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.100]   I was ready to buy every course that they offered.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:48.740]   I was this close to putting down a credit card and getting a $30,000 private coaching
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.740]   package.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.860]   I almost did it.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.540]   And thankfully, I was so excited and enthusiastic about how I was going to become rich.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.220]   I sat down and told my dad all about it.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:08.000]   And thankfully, he advised me not to buy the $30,000 private mentoring program.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.340]   And thankfully, I listened to him.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.300]   Hopefully you heard the slight sense of sarcasm in the term "advise."
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.460]   He put his foot down and said, "Don't do it."
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.860]   And thankfully, I obeyed.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.300]   And I'm so grateful to him that I did.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.940]   But it was a big opening to me where I realized, "Wow, I can invest in real estate.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.460]   And this is really exciting to me, all these things that I can do and all this money that
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.220]   I can make."
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.980]   The major challenge was I didn't have any money to start with.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.180]   I was basically broke all the way through college working my way through.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.060]   And I never really had much money where I could go out and buy real estate, nor did
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:47.580]   I have a good enough advice or confidence to go out and build it the way that some people
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.980]   have been able to do it with no money down from the beginning.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.820]   I wasn't knowledgeable enough and I wasn't getting good enough advice to do it.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.020]   In retrospect, I'm thankful that I didn't pursue it at that time because I sat back
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:06.340]   and I watched several of my friends who had been in similar circles proceed to build their
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:12.900]   real estate empires and then lose them in the real estate crash of the late 2000s.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.380]   And it really taught me a lot.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.700]   See, I'd gotten really into it.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:22.020]   I bought all the books and all the DVDs and the Carlton Sheets thing and read all...
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.860]   I went to the Rich Dad seminars and read the Rich Dad Poor Dad books and Dolph D'Arou and
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.660]   all these gurus that were prominent at the time.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.260]   And I was convinced that they were my ticket.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.940]   I didn't yet know how to filter good advice from bad advice.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.980]   I didn't yet know how to protect myself.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.740]   So I was casting around looking for who to listen to, but I didn't know how to choose
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.300]   the right person to listen to.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.060]   Well, I fast forward.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:56.140]   I went through a few different crises in my college years trying to figure out, "Okay,
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.140]   what am I going to do?"
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.140]   And I studied abroad.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.280]   And so I let most of those financial things go for a little bit until I came back my junior
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.940]   year and got a hold of Dave Ramsey's stuff.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.280]   Dave Ramsey's book, Total Money Makeover, decided to go ahead and dig in and pay off
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.480]   my debt, worked like crazy to do that.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.820]   Got a good job, lived on nothing, saved, paid cash for my senior year of school, and then
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.940]   paid off all my student loans a couple of weeks before I graduated by working like a
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.940]   maniac.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.340]   And that opened my eyes up to see some of the things that I could do.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.060]   Well, I graduated from college.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.620]   And at that time, I was just...
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.460]   I'd been so focused on paying off debt.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.580]   I hadn't gotten involved in any other major investment plan.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.300]   I opened up my 401(k) at work.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.620]   I was putting still some money into my Roth IRA.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:51.520]   Worked one more year for the company that I worked for when I graduated, the company
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.900]   had been in college.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.440]   But there was a little bit of a crisis there.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.700]   So I was kind of getting ahead a little bit and then falling back.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.900]   And the crisis was that the deal they had made with me was that they would give me a
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.660]   little bit of extra tuition money if I would consider working there in a different capacity
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.220]   after I finished college.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.220]   Well, I finished college.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.820]   I said, "Okay, what's the job we're going to do?"
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.060]   And they said, "Well, we don't really have another job."
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.580]   But at that time, I had been working in their graphics department, creating graphics for
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.500]   their client presentations.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.900]   And I just said, "Well, I'm not going to keep doing this.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.660]   I need to get the big shot job."
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.660]   So I quit the job.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.260]   They said, "Well, call us."
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.900]   And my plan was I quit the job and took a road trip all around the U.S.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.780]   Took got in my little 1993 Honda Accord and did a 13,000-mile road trip all across the
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.180]   U.S. and up to Canada, visiting my friends all along the way.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.780]   Came back and we set up a job as an analyst.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.220]   That worked out for another year.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.620]   I was getting ahead financially.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.980]   I was able to save money.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.300]   I had just made it.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.940]   I didn't have more than a few thousand dollars saved in savings accounts when I graduated
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.020]   from college because I'd been so busy paying off my debt.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.820]   And then the road trip had used up most of my money.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.700]   Worked there a year, was able to save up six months of my expenses in that year, and then
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.000]   I got laid off.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.940]   And that left me in a situation where I'm just saying, "What do I do?"
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.700]   And so that was when I wound up getting in the financial services business, joined Northwestern
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:18.660]   Mutual and started my financial planning practice.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.400]   As I built my financial planning practice, I built it based upon financial planning expertise.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.860]   And so always over on the personal finance or financial planning side of things.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.000]   Never really made a lot of progress on the investment side.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.480]   Focused for the first three years on insurance sales and developing my financial planning
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   knowledge.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.760]   And then finally, I went through the basic license and got my investment licenses.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.380]   But just because you're a licensed investment broker doesn't mean you have a clue about
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.460]   what you're doing with regard to picking stocks or anything like that.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.760]   And I just said, "Well, I'm not an investment expert, but I do understand the mutual fund
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.120]   market."
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.580]   And I was a real expert with the mutual fund market, but not from the perspective of knowing
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.120]   when to buy and sell, knowing how to time the market, knowing how to do that.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.880]   I never once told a client that I could do any of those things.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.220]   I just explained what we could do.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:16.200]   Never focused on that seductive side of the industry of promising the things that you
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   can't promise.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.660]   I was an expert at financial planning, and we had enough company experts that I could
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:29.820]   be confident in on the investment portfolio management side of things.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.920]   Along the way, my own personal investments were fairly mainstream.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.500]   I had my Roth IRA, which I had funded a little while.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.780]   I had my 401(k) from my job.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.520]   I had my pension plan as a financial advisor.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.400]   I bought some mutual funds, but everything was basically mainstream.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.940]   Took a while until I could build the financial foundation under myself as a financial planner.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.140]   Took several years to build that, and I was sitting there looking and saying, "Okay, now
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.060]   what am I going to do?
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.820]   How am I going to invest my time and invest my money?"
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.800]   The biggest benefit of being a financial advisor was that – well, one benefit of being a
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.020]   financial advisor was that I had a lot of income potential, but it was all based upon
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.020]   the business.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.500]   I could talk with the older financial advisors.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:19.420]   I could clearly see how I could go from $50,000 a year to $500,000 a year in the next five
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   to ten years.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.700]   I could clearly see how I could make a million, $2 million a year.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:30.540]   When I would compare various investment alternatives to that income potential, I generally found
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.640]   that my best bet was to focus on the income potential.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.700]   It would be silly for me to spend hours away from my financial planning practice focusing
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.740]   on investing in a little real estate deal that was going to make me $50,000 when by
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:51.260]   investing those same hours into my practice, I could go from $100,000 a year to $400,000
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.040]   a year.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.740]   So I stuck with mainstream investing, mutual fund ownership.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.660]   Along the way, I did try from time to time to get interested in the technical side of
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.660]   things.
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.580]   I considered becoming a chartered financial analyst.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.620]   My main attraction to it, though, I had to admit to myself, was not that I actually cared
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:18.060]   about being able to understand the nuts and bolts of stock analysis, but rather that it
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.100]   was just super hard.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:24.060]   And I liked the fact that I could build prestige if I were able to do the stuff that was super
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.740]   hard.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:33.300]   And I just finally realized I didn't care that much about learning the in-depth company
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.800]   picking approach type of thing.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.060]   So I just said, "That's all right.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.060]   I don't need to.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.540]   I'm good at asset allocation.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.620]   I'm good at financial planning.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.140]   I'm good at explaining these things and being the in-between."
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.940]   Years passed, and as I just watched the financial planning industry, those of you who know my
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.660]   story, I came to the conclusion, I said, "What we're doing just isn't working very well."
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.220]   The vast majority of my clients were never going to be rich.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.060]   And it wasn't because I was doing anything bad for them.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:08.900]   It wasn't because I was necessarily selling them a bad investment or doing a bad job with
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.900]   their tax planning.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.220]   It was just that their whole financial plan was weak and impotent.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.220]   It wasn't...
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.780]   I mean, what's the point?
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:23.740]   You put aside money in your 401(k) and you see everyone stuck in mediocrity, stuck working
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.300]   jobs that, well, they're doable, but they're not that great.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.920]   We don't care that much.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.180]   People not really applying themselves to their business or to their career.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.140]   It's just, "Well, I'll get a little bit better, mediocre.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.340]   A little bit of credit card debt here.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.860]   Put a little bit of money in the 401(k) there.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:45.020]   Buy some mediocre investments that might go up at 7% per year over time, which means that
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.580]   in theory I might have a few hundred thousand dollars when I'm 65 years old."
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.540]   It's not an exciting plan.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.040]   And I would find that I was very good at showing people another way, but that then they would
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   fall apart.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.120]   And I was excited about my financial plan because I'm sitting there looking at my business
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.020]   and saying, "Well, I can go from $100,000 a year to a million dollars a year."
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.660]   And as I started to learn about the impact of savings rates, I'm looking at my expenses
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.960]   and saying, "Well, I can cut these things down.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.820]   And look, I can be financially independent."
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.380]   And I was excited, but I couldn't.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.660]   Just the standard American financial plan sucks.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.980]   So that was where the show came from.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.720]   Just some of the conversations I have with people and I'm like, "Somebody should teach
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.340]   somebody how to integrate these things."
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.540]   Not that mutual funds are bad.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.260]   Not that 401(k)s are bad.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.260]   They're just weak.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:39.220]   It's like telling a 400-pound fat person that, "Well, if you just do one little thing, if
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.980]   you stop drinking one soda a day, you're going to lose weight."
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.620]   Is that a good start?
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.620]   Maybe.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.020]   But that's not the kind of thing that's going to have them on the cover of a fitness magazine
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.900]   three years later.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.940]   So that's what's so difficult with the message of radical personal finance.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.260]   Not that there's anything wrong with those things.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.900]   And for some people, they might be right.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.660]   But I just got sick and tired of it and said, "This is not as good as it should be."
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.740]   Well, I learned that I love business.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.500]   In that process of learning myself, learning a lot about finance, learning a lot about
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.260]   investing, studying a lot of things, reading a ton, being interested in different areas,
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.980]   I learned that I love business.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:24.020]   I love deals, but I don't love charts and ratios.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:29.340]   I don't love technical analysis that has to be done on an ongoing basis.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.860]   I tried to get into trading.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.660]   I tried to get into these things and I'd read the books and just, "Ah, this isn't for me.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.660]   I'm bored."
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.620]   But I still love business and I still love deals.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:47.160]   And then I became over time dissatisfied with the ethics of many of the large companies
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160]   that I own.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.580]   I'd read the newspaper and I'd read what the CEO of this company said or the CEO of that
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:58.260]   company said and I'd be like, "Well, I don't want that person getting any of my money."
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.740]   And I'd read what this company was doing here or that company was doing there.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   I'd say, "Well, I don't like that move."
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:11.180]   And read about the amount of money that my own company sent up to Washington to change
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.660]   the politicians' mind.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.100]   And I was like, "Well, why are we doing this?
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.700]   The entire system is corrupt.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.380]   This system of crony capitalism in the United States where the companies run the government,
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.900]   it's just utterly corrupt."
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:34.020]   And finally, I got to a point where for that reason among other things, I just became disillusioned
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.020]   with the ethics of many of the companies.
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.100]   I don't want the blood money.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:47.940]   I don't want to profit from the activities of this company.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.340]   I don't want to be in a position where I've got to stand before God one day and say, "Oh,
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:58.420]   yeah, I was rich and fat and happy because we built an economy that exists based upon
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.940]   the war machine and I sit back and collect my dividends while we bomb everybody around
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.460]   the world, keep the entire war and global conflict and I just sit back and profit from
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.460]   it."
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.700]   That doesn't make me feel really good.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.520]   I don't want the blood on my hands.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.260]   And I just finally came to the point where I said, "I can't take it anymore."
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:24.140]   And so I sold all my stocks, sold all my mutual funds and have sat in cash for over a year
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.140]   just kind of sitting and waiting.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.240]   Now I'm not trying to impose those things on you.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.300]   You have to deal with your own conscience.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.860]   But that was a surprising turn of events for me.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:44.460]   I didn't expect to have to face my conscience on many of those things.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:52.820]   So I came to the realization that I want to know what I own and why I own it.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.900]   And I started to build my own investment plan.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.300]   This has been a combination of years.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.140]   And as I talk about investments here, I'm talking about the major growth assets.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.860]   I'm talking about investments that are designed toward wealth.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.100]   I'm not talking about savings or insurance assets.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.780]   On today's show, I'm not talking about savings account or precious metals or cash
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.500]   values and life insurance policies or any of that stuff.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.460]   I'm talking about growth investments.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:23.020]   And I started to build a philosophy of what I want in an investment program.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.240]   I'm a little annoyed that I'm 30 years old and I didn't know this at 20.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.620]   But hey, some people did.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.260]   I sometimes get a little jealous that other people had it figured out, but I didn't.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.740]   But I figure, well, I'm 30 and there's probably a lot of 40-year-olds listening to me that
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.820]   are jealous that they didn't figure it out when they were 30.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.420]   So I better just figure it out.
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.780]   And so now I want to tell you about kind of what I want in an investment plan.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.780]   Before I do, sponsor for the first half of the show, Jay Fleischman, Student Loan Show.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.780]   Jay is an awesome guy.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.180]   He's a student loan attorney.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.340]   He also hosts a podcast called the Student Loan Show.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.860]   He's been on Radical Personal Finance twice.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:05.220]   Both of those interviews were packed with content, packed with information.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:13.220]   And if you have student loans, I urge you, I personally urge you, sit down with Jay for
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.220]   a consultation and spend some time just looking to see if there's an intelligent strategy
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.820]   that can help you.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:25.240]   Many, many people in today's society have tens of thousands of dollars of student loans.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.700]   And there might be a unique and creative strategy that you can find that will either help you
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.340]   to lower the interest rate that you're paying, lower the payments, and maybe even have some
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.020]   of the debt forgiven.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.620]   Jay is a real expert on these things and he knows his stuff.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.860]   He is an attorney who teaches other attorneys how to do this type of consultation.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.220]   So if you have student loans or if you know anybody with student loans, you have a brother
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:54.000]   or a sister, a buddy, a friend, a son or a daughter, if you know anybody who has student
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.980]   loans, I urge you to get a personal consultation from Jay.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.880]   Go to studentloanshow.com/radical, studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.100]   There you'll see Jay's multiple packages there.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.160]   He offers a $25 discount on the email consultation with listeners of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.360]   You can start there.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.720]   That's a discount on a consultation for your federal student loans.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.860]   Or if you have private student loans, you might want to go ahead and sign up for one
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.720]   of his higher packages.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.580]   But that would be money well spent.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.980]   And if Jay can't save you any money, I've gotten good response that Jay's been able
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.400]   to help a number of people.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.720]   If Jay can't save you any money and you waste your 50 bucks, it's not a waste.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.600]   It's called being intelligent about what's going on.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.340]   But so far, the feedback that I've gotten has been very favorable.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.160]   So studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.200]   While you're there, make sure to subscribe for his podcast and subscribe in iTunes.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.720]   Check it out if you're interested in the topic of student loans.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.400]   And also, if you have need for – if you're in any kind of litigious situation with a
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.920]   creditor on student loans, remember Jay does that type of work as well.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.320]   He's admitted to the bar in California and New York and he has a team of attorneys all
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.080]   over the country that he can refer you to.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.040]   So studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.620]   I'm sure that my investment requirements will change going forward.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:23.680]   But for today, I have five important pillars that I've built for my own personal investment
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.800]   strategy, things that are important to me in my investment activities.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.920]   Nothing magic about this.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.400]   Maybe some can go away, some can come in the future.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   But here are mine.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:44.760]   Number one, I want to own investments that I understand fully.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   I want to do stuff with money that I understand.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.200]   I think this is one of the biggest mistakes that people make is they invest in things
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.040]   they don't understand.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.080]   And this can be on the crazy spectrum or the not crazy spectrum.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.840]   But time and again, I've done a couple of shows when the market – stock market is
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   volatile and things.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.960]   And I just say, "Do you not understand your investment strategy?"
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.400]   The people who get nervous when markets are wonky are those who don't understand their
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.840]   strategy enough to follow through.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.000]   And I want to do stuff with money that I understand.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.200]   I've heard other pundits and gurus make that advice and I believe it makes all the
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.320]   difference in the world.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.440]   Do things with money that you understand.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.280]   Now the challenge with me building my own personal investment plan has been I needed
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:38.360]   to get a little bit of time from my financial – for my financial interests to disappear
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   into the past.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.280]   It's so difficult to be able to face your opinions and to be able to face your – the
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:50.400]   things that you believe if they're biased based upon a financial interest.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.440]   So that's one of the reasons why I've taken so much time to comment about things, just
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.880]   to kind of test and see, well, do I really believe the things that I used to teach people
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.320]   two years ago when I had a financial interest in their actions or not?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.640]   Most of them I do believe.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   Some of them I question.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.880]   But it's important to me to do things with money that I understand.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.480]   I don't think any of us should do anything with money we don't understand.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.520]   We get screwed when we do things that we can't fully understand.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.920]   If we can't – if I can't explain to my 10 or 12-year-old niece or 15-year-old nephew
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.200]   or something like that, if I can't explain what I'm doing with money, I probably shouldn't
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.740]   be doing it.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.600]   So if I understand my investments, then I'll be comfortable with what's going on.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.960]   If I understand them, I'll be comfortable with understanding the forces that are acting
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.720]   upon them.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.760]   If I understand what I own and why I own it – this is one of the reasons why mutual
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.040]   funds I think can be so dangerous, is many people don't understand what's in their
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.480]   mutual funds.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.200]   All they see is the mutual fund statement.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.320]   So the numbers start going down.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.680]   They don't know what it is.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.160]   If I own investments and if I own quality assets, then when markets get bumpy, then
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.040]   I'm not so worried about it.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.200]   If you own shares of Coca-Cola Corporation and you know that Coca-Cola Corporation has
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.560]   a strong business plan, they've got this incredible global market presence, they've
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.460]   got this incredible reputation, if you read your annual reports and you stay a little
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.680]   bit abreast of what's going on with Coca-Cola stock, and all of a sudden you wake up and
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.840]   you open up your brokerage statement, you see that your Coca-Cola stock has declined
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.600]   in share price by 20 percent, you don't worry about it.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.400]   You just say, "Bummer.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   The market's down.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.600]   People don't like this right now, but I'm okay with it because it's a really quality
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   company."
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.720]   So I think understanding leads to comfort, and comfort is what makes all the difference
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.400]   in the world to be able to stick through difficult times.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:54.720]   So I want investments that I understand.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:03.120]   Number two, I want investments that I can control and/or I can influence.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.960]   Now I'm using the term investments broadly here, but I'd want investments that I can
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.920]   control and/or influence, if possible.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.760]   So the best example is radical personal finance.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.120]   I have invested a tremendous amount into radical personal finance.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:24.940]   I've invested primarily time and energy and sweat and tears and labor, and also a good
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.040]   bit of money, but I control it and I can influence it.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.560]   I know the things that if I do these things each and every day, this will lead to the
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.320]   growth of the business.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.600]   So private business is one of the biggest things where I can control or influence, but
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.280]   I also want this in my investments.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.480]   So I want this in—this is why I'm personally very attracted.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.800]   I'm not attracted necessarily to technical analysis of large public-traded companies.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.760]   I'm very attracted to venture funding.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.960]   I'm very attracted to private business investment and local private businesses.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.120]   During my time as a professional financial advisor, I got to meet some people, and I
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.840]   got to meet some cool people here in my local community that were doing fascinating things.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:17.160]   I met people who were investment managers at family offices, private family offices,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.600]   and multifamily offices.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   I met people who were just wealthy people who were running their family's trust funds.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.440]   I met people who were investing in all kinds of interesting things.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.560]   There's one guy that I met that I thought was fascinating.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.480]   He invested in a local supermarket chain.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   Somebody came to him.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.080]   That person needed funding, and they invested, and the investors made a ton of money, and
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.000]   the owner of the supermarket chain has made a ton of money.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.080]   And I thought, "Wow, that's the kind of stuff that I want to do.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   I want things that I can influence."
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.360]   So for me, that's a big deal, control or influence, because if I can control or influence it,
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.720]   then I can take my human capital, my labor, my contacts, my influence, any of those kinds
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.240]   of things, and I can push them at that, and I can affect the real estate—excuse me,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.760]   I can affect the growth of the business, hopefully positively.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.200]   I could affect things negatively, but hopefully positively.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.240]   So for me, that's important to me.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.600]   And I've recognized I can't do that with many investment strategies.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.960]   Next thing that's important to me, I want to invest in a way that I can get high returns.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.280]   Returns matter in investing, big time.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.960]   And recognizing, back to the radical personal finance framework of wealth building, remember,
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.680]   the only three things you control—how much money you make, your income; how much money
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.300]   you spend, your expenses; and the rate of return you earn on the difference.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.820]   And if you control that rate of return, and you can control it in the sense of moving
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.720]   from bonds to stocks—I always worked hard with my asset management clients to move them
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:02.420]   from bonds to stocks in an appropriate way, but because that decision alone, over a long-term
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.280]   investment career, will make a bigger difference than probably anything else.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.520]   It's the asset allocation decision.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.080]   So returns matter, and I want to invest in areas where I can get very high returns.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.220]   Challenge you something.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:19.500]   Take the amount of money that you have invested currently and ask yourself how much money
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:25.740]   that would be worth if you invested at a 5% return in 20 years.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:30.220]   How much it would be worth if you invested at a 10% return for 20 years?
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.100]   A 15% return for 20 years?
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.780]   A 20% rate of return for 20 years?
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.780]   25%?
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.500]   Go to 50% and ask yourself that question.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.820]   Now, here's the problem with returns.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:48.140]   I do not believe that if you, as a normal person, get involved and buy a piece of software
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.820]   over the internet that's going to teach you a cool stock-picking strategy that you're
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:58.140]   going to be able to magically create 30% annualized rate of returns each and every year, fast,
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.700]   cheap, and easy, just by using the computer program.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   That doesn't work.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:11.660]   But yet, there are people who routinely create 30% annual rates of return on their investments.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.220]   And that will be everything from the car dealer who's buying cars cheap and flipping them
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.780]   and selling them at a profit.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.980]   That's a business, but it's also an investment.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.380]   That's the local real estate investor who's structuring a note and discounting a note
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:30.820]   that he owes in such a way that it creates a 30% growth rate.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:36.780]   That is some people who are investing in publicly traded companies, but there are investment
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.380]   opportunities out there.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.100]   And if I lock up all my money in areas where I can get average market returns, it's going
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.260]   to take me a really long time to build wealth.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:52.820]   So if I can get high returns, I should be pursuing that because returns matter.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:58.700]   Next thing for me, number four, I want an investment plan where I can leverage my investments
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.300]   safely, because leverage matters.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:09.460]   To use probably a simplistic metaphor, ask yourself how much you can pick up by yourself
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.900]   and ask yourself how much you can pick up by using a crowbar as a lever.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.340]   It's a big difference.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.540]   Leverage matters.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.380]   There are many types of leverage.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:24.380]   Financial leverage through the use of debt is not the only type of leverage, but it's
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.500]   one type of leverage that you can use.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.380]   That you can leverage your time, you can leverage your influence, you can leverage your contacts.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:38.540]   Radical personal finance for me is a leverage business, because what I grew annoyed with
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.460]   as a financial planner is I could never multiply my time and efforts.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.340]   If I was sitting face to face with one person, I couldn't be sitting face to face simultaneously
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.680]   with another person.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.420]   So it drove me out of that business.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.100]   One of many things that drove me out of that business is I can't find the point of leverage.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.520]   I can't find the lever to push on that makes this thing grow.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.020]   Now as an example, radical personal finance, I have massive leverage.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.260]   I'm still creating things, but I can bring other people's work in, leverage my business.
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:13.740]   And if I go from 10,000 listeners to 100,000 listeners, it requires zero additional time.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.020]   It requires just the tiniest bit of additional time for me to make sure that the technology
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.980]   is robust enough to handle it.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.900]   If I went from 10,000 to 100,000 listeners, it would require zero additional time.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.780]   If I went to millions, it would require something different.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.700]   So that's leverage.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.120]   But financial leverage is important.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.860]   And so I want investments where I can use financial leverage in an intelligent and careful,
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.540]   safe way, because I personally am a very risk-averse person.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.900]   I want to control my risks.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.340]   I want to plan for them.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.060]   I want to have backup plans.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.220]   It's funny, I talk to people who say, "Wow, so risky for you to start radical personal
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   finance."
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.660]   I haven't had risk all along the way, because I've controlled for it.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.580]   I've known what it was, and I was able to handle it.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.700]   I had backup plans.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.380]   Yes, there is a risk the business would fail, but that didn't put my family at risk of bankruptcy.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.580]   That didn't put us at the edge.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.800]   So I've controlled for the risk.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.340]   And so I want to use financial leverage in an appropriate and careful way.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.580]   And there are many ways to do that.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:18.900]   Number five, I want to own investments that I'm proud to own and I'm proud to profit from.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.100]   I want to do things that I'm proud of telling my children about.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:28.780]   I want to do things I'm proud of being seen publicly, in the sense that if things are
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:35.940]   disclosed, I want all of my actions to be honorable and above reproach.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:41.500]   I want them to be things that I'm proud of.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.580]   I'm not proud of owning Citibank stock.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.500]   I'm not proud of some of those types of things.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.620]   I want things I do to be things I'm proud of.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.940]   So here's my strategy going forward.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:00.500]   Number one area of focus for me is to invest in my own businesses, both the current businesses
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.660]   that I have and future businesses, because that's where the most leverage comes from.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.760]   That's where I have the most control, the most influence.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.100]   That's where the highest returns come from.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.560]   That's where the business, the things that I can fully understand, those are the things
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.100]   where I can apply leverage very safely.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.860]   And those are the things that I'm most proud of.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:25.340]   So my own businesses, both now and future.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.300]   Number two, I want to invest in other people's private businesses.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.640]   I want to be the guy who's putting up money for a percentage of ownership in the supermarket
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.260]   chain that's making money hands over fist.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:43.500]   I want to be the guy who's backing the local business that needed a boost in order to build
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:49.020]   this really world changing product or service.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:54.140]   I want to be the guy who is putting some money behind the technology that can make a huge
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.500]   difference in the world and make a lot of money while it's going.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.620]   So I want to invest in other private businesses.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.620]   Number three is to invest in real estate.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.380]   And that's what the next part of the show is going to be about is my specific plan.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.540]   But I want to invest using real estate for reasons I'll go over in a moment.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:17.020]   And then number four is I want to own individual stocks in some publicly traded businesses.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.500]   And so those are kind of that those are the aspects of my personal strategy.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.380]   Now the challenge is what's the right order to do these things?
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.460]   And that's where number one, the best first thing I need to focus on is my own business
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.040]   because my business gives me the lifestyle freedom that I need and want while I am building
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.100]   financial independence.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.740]   My business allows me to do the things I think are interesting.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.860]   I don't have to ask a boss when I go in and do this.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.380]   I don't have to ask somebody.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.420]   I'm accountable to you, the listening audience.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.420]   You guys are my boss.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.680]   But in the aggregate, I get a lot of flexibility from that.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.880]   And so the first thing for me to stay focused on and even to stay laser focused on this
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.740]   year in the coming years is to continue to build the momentum behind my business.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.540]   That should be thing number one.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.500]   What about investing in other private businesses?
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.460]   Well, this is where I reach a challenge of scale.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.500]   I would like to invest in other private businesses, but I do not yet have enough investment
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.860]   capital to be able to meaningfully make a difference in most businesses.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   And if I were to put as much investment capital as I have into other businesses, it would
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.940]   be far too risky for me.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:28.000]   I don't have $5 million yet where I can carve off a million dollars or half a million dollars
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.540]   to invest in businesses that are speculative that may or may not go belly up, may or may
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.180]   not make me a ton of money.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.900]   I can't take that much risk at this point in time.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.500]   It's too risky for me.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:45.180]   So I'm not at the scale of assets where it's appropriate for me to be trotting around town
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.140]   saying, hey, entrepreneurs, come on.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.420]   I've got Joshua Sheed's venture capital fund.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.420]   I'm not there yet.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.380]   I've got to build the assets, continue to build the income, continue to build the investment
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.020]   capital to where I can go ahead.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:02.820]   And when I reach the point where I can easily write a $25,000 check or $100,000 check without
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.100]   completely messing up my risk profile on my investment portfolio, then I'll be ready for
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.100]   that.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.460]   But what I can do for investing in private businesses is build the infrastructure right
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.460]   now.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   I can build the context.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:19.100]   I can build the knowledge, the things I'm learning with all of my own current endeavors.
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.780]   All of that stuff is preparation for that.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.420]   So my own business right now is going forward hot and heavy on that.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.500]   Investing in other private businesses, that's very, very slow.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.020]   It's not appropriate for this stage of my wealth building.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.860]   Number three, real estate is appropriate at this stage of my wealth building.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:44.300]   And we're going to talk about that in just a moment when I show you why and what my personal
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.020]   strategy is for that.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.860]   Real estate is a place where I can invest.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.460]   I can apply my knowledge.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.460]   I can apply my expertise.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:58.020]   I can apply the advantages that I have in my local market.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:02.060]   I can apply the capital that I have without taking undue risk.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:10.220]   I don't have to put – I won't risk my investment capital to where if I have a deal go bad that
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.180]   it runs the risk of putting my family out on the street.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.600]   So real estate is my best investment opportunity right now.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.460]   What about individual stock ownership?
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.100]   That's also a good opportunity.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:27.520]   But the challenge with individual stock ownership for me at this stage is I want more leverage
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:33.940]   and higher returns than I can get with the assets that I have right now.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:39.640]   And so I have some companies that I'm watching and I'm paying attention to.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:46.580]   But it's much more challenging to leverage your money safely in individual stock ownership
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:52.180]   than it is to leverage it in real estate or in business.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.540]   It's much more challenging to do it safely.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:00.540]   So I pay attention but it's not my number one focus right now.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.260]   That all changes as time goes on.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:09.500]   I am very attracted personally for my personality type, especially given some of the constraints
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.660]   that I mentioned earlier.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:17.100]   I'm very attracted to value investing and just to value investing.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:22.180]   That's my personal bent in the area of stock ownership.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.700]   So I don't enjoy trading.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.860]   I have no interest in being a short term trader.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:33.020]   My investment strategy with publicly traded businesses is very simple.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.900]   Have a simple brokerage account and buy shares when I believe the price is good in companies
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.700]   that I want to own for the rest of my life.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.340]   And then sit back and spend the dividends.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.120]   Because truly that's the ultimate of financial freedom and financial independence where you're
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.260]   simply living off of the dividends of companies that other people manage.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.260]   None of that.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.260]   That's true passive income.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.660]   All of these other investment activities are passive income.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:02.060]   True passive income is sitting back and living off of the dividends from companies that other
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.860]   people manage and other people supervise.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.860]   That's the real benefit.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.420]   But at this point you get, but in exchange for that really passive income, you're going
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:16.260]   to get lower returns than these other more active types of investments that I am doing.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.420]   So in a moment I'll just talk about my real estate strategy.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.740]   Before I do, sponsor for the second half of the show is Trade King.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.740]   And so Trade King is the perfect fit.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.820]   If you want to do something like I've described where you want to have a brokerage account
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.020]   and you want to buy some stocks, you want to just see whether you're going to, you might
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.100]   be a trader, you might be into that.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.860]   Recognize I focused on just what's right for me.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.420]   I'm not giving you advice on what you should do.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.040]   Your personality type may be different than me and you've got to recognize that.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.340]   Know yourself and know what's right for you.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.300]   So whether you want to pursue some sort of aggressive trading strategy and you want to
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:01.660]   set up all kinds of interesting, unique structures and ways to purchase and sell your stocks,
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.200]   you can do that with Trade King.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.900]   If you just want to buy and hold some individual stocks, you can do that with Trade King.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.940]   If you want to buy and sell or buy and hold mutual funds, you can do that with Trade King.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:18.340]   You could even check out if you want an index fund that's basically their version of a robo
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:24.380]   advisors, not an exact index fund, but a carefully managed portfolio for really low fees, you
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.560]   can do that with Trade King.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.400]   So they're a great sponsor of the show.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Really like the guys.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.900]   They're based out of Fort Lauderdale in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.100]   They have $4.95 stock trades.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:40.320]   So if you, like I, are going to get in a situation where you say, "I want to own individual companies
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.740]   for $4.95," you're into that company stock.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.280]   So check out all the information.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.680]   Go to TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.340]   If you sign up through that tracking link, number one, it'll help them to know that I'm
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:58.960]   doing a good job advertising them on the show, but it'll also get you a hundred bucks in
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   your trading account.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.360]   If you fund your trading account with a thousand dollars, they'll give you a hundred dollar
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.480]   bonus.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.040]   So that right there, if you do that, even if your investments don't go anywhere, that's
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.680]   the equivalent of a 10% right off the bat increase in your money.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.120]   So TradeKing.com/radical if you are interested in setting up a brokerage account for yourself
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.280]   and pursuing an investment strategy that you have interest in.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.360]   Again, it can be for your major money.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.640]   It can even be for your play account.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.000]   Good strategy is, I think, to have a play account, something that keeps you interested
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.640]   on the side.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.160]   So let's talk about real estate in my own investment.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.000]   So as I described, those are my four basic focuses.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.400]   And for me, number one, business and real estate are where I'm at at this scale of my
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   financial plan and the things that are appropriate to me.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.200]   But I have some major concerns with real estate.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.480]   I've studied it a lot over the years.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.800]   I've studied the strategies.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.280]   I've studied the different approaches.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.120]   I've studied the different ways to invest in real estate.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.140]   There's dozens of ways you can invest in real estate.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.520]   But I have two big concerns that I don't want to pursue.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:10.000]   Number one is I do not want to do physical construction work on real estate projects.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.240]   I don't want to do it.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.000]   I can do it.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.520]   I'm more capable with DIY projects than most people.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.760]   I'm more capable at fixing things than most people.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.960]   I've got a lot of experience, but I have enough experience to know that I don't want to do
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   it.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.120]   It's not the highest and best use of my time.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.000]   I don't enjoy it.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.680]   And I find it frustrating because I don't do it a lot.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:35.440]   So I don't want to use a real estate strategy that involves me doing physical construction
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   work.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.600]   Lots of people, that's the best thing for them.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.280]   Whether that's you buy a move into a house and fix it up while you're living there on
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.840]   the weekends, and then you turn around and sell it and take all that increased money
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.480]   tax-free, you can do that.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.640]   There's a bunch of people who are very good at that.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.900]   I have family members who are very good at that approach.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.400]   That's not appropriate for me.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.520]   I don't want to do physical construction work.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:03.920]   If I have to do physical construction work, I would rather become a stock-picking guru
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.760]   than go and do physical construction work.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:11.040]   It's easier and more fun for me to learn that than it is to learn the physical construction.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.080]   Number two is I don't want a maintenance-intensive landlording job.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:20.480]   Real estate investing, at least done in the way that you are buying and owning properties,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.280]   is kind of a funny mixture of a business and an investment, where you're getting attributes
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   of both.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.260]   It is a part-time job in a way.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:34.240]   And so for me, I don't want a maintenance-intensive landlording job.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:40.200]   So I could go out today, I could buy a 100-unit apartment complex, I could move my family
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.280]   into one of those units, and I could run the 100-unit apartment complex, or 20, whatever,
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.520]   you make up the number.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.360]   I don't want to do that, because those type of tenants are very maintenance-intensive.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.600]   It's a lot of work, and that's not work that I think that I'm very well-suited for.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.440]   That's not what I want to do with my money.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.360]   So given those two constraints, I need a strategy that will account for those constraints if
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.620]   I'm going to invest in real estate.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:09.780]   Lots of ways I can skin this cat, but I've chosen to focus on one specific strategy,
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.220]   at least for now.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:18.740]   And that strategy is to buy single-family houses in the middle of the market in my local
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:23.580]   area, and to buy them and to hold them for a long time.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.240]   And my favorite strategy over the years, of all the dozens of real estate books I've read
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.740]   and all the things I've studied, my favorite strategy is John Schaub's "Building Wealth
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   One House at a Time."
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.300]   That was his book on the subject.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.440]   He's been on the show.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.700]   But that is my favorite approach.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.100]   I just got back this weekend from going to John Schaub's seminar.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.940]   Now this show, I intended to record this show on Friday morning.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:51.020]   I left my house in West Palm Beach at 4.30 on Friday morning to drive over to Sarasota,
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:55.060]   and I intended to record this show in the car on the way there because I didn't want
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.300]   my show on real estate to be influenced by the seminar that I'd come from.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.500]   I didn't know, am I going to be super excited or not?
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.620]   This was a carefully—I went to this seminar because what Schaub teaches is what I want.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:10.420]   I'm not creating this strategy because of what I learned at the seminar this weekend.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:15.140]   But unfortunately, as I was driving across the state, it was blackout, it was dark, and
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.180]   it was also raining.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.660]   And so I didn't think it was safe enough for me to be recording my podcast while I drove,
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.380]   and I wasn't able to get it done at any other time.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.580]   I intend to do a separate review of Schaub's seminar.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.740]   In short, it was excellent.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:35.980]   But I just want to clarify that I chose the seminar because since I've chosen this strategy,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:41.100]   then I need to make sure that I become an expert in my strategy, and Schaub is the guy
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.660]   I want to build a relationship there with him so I have the chance to help.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:49.780]   So he has a chance—if I need help, I've got the go-to guy for that.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:57.060]   So I've chosen to invest in real estate because, number one, real estate—local, individual,
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:01.100]   residential real estate—is an inefficient market.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:10.660]   It's an inefficient market that I can personally understand, value, and I can exploit the inefficiencies
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.060]   when I find them.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:18.460]   By investing in what I know, where I live, I can be confident.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.460]   Much more easily, I can be confident in my analysis.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.300]   And because it's inefficient, I can find problems that people have, and then I can
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.100]   solve them for them.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.420]   That's what real estate is.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:36.340]   So I can put together a deal, and I can put together a creative deal which appeals to
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.140]   my personal inclination.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.140]   That's what I like to do.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:44.340]   I like to find creative ways to use—whether it's creative ways to use certain types of
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.940]   real estate contracts, whether it's creative ways to put together financing, whether it's
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.700]   creative ways to solve people's problems.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.240]   That's what I'm good at.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.340]   I like doing that.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.420]   I'm good at that.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:58.460]   And so I can find those deals and put those things together, and that's using what I'm
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:02.900]   good at, putting together the deal, solving the problems in a unique and elegant way in
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.940]   a local, inefficient market where I can be confident of the values.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:15.960]   Real estate is something where I can apply a unique skill that I have and a unique work
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.340]   ethic that I have that many people aren't going to apply.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:23.980]   See, many people look for deals by sitting back and waiting for something to pop up in
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:24.980]   their MLS.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.300]   Well, you got some more competition.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.200]   Got a bunch of friends of mine who invest in real estate here locally.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.580]   Some of the markets they work in are cutthroat, and you're constantly in competition with
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.580]   it.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.180]   But I'm willing to do things that other people aren't willing to do.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.620]   And so by doing things that other people aren't willing to do, I can find deals that other
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.060]   people aren't going to find.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:50.340]   I can operate a local real estate investment business at an appropriate scale.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:59.660]   So the amount of investment capital that I have set aside is very appropriate to local
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.840]   residential real estate investment.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:07.780]   I'm not broke, so I don't have to go out and try to put together deals with no money down,
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:11.360]   with no cash, where I can't handle anything and I'm kind of living on the edge.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.720]   There have been people who've been able to do that, but I'm not in that situation.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.060]   And so that brings me a lot of confidence.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.680]   But I'm not at the point where I've got $10 million that I'm trying to figure out what
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.940]   do I do.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.740]   And that's where you've got to look at the scale of your investment capital.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:31.900]   If somebody has $200 to their name, they're better off not investing in real estate.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:36.840]   They're better off buying a broken weed eater on Craigslist, fixing it and flipping it on
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.340]   Craigslist.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:45.540]   If somebody has, what was it, Warren Buffett, we use him because he's such an extreme example.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.620]   But think about what a massive problem Warren Buffett has investing his money.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.860]   He's got so much free cash flow.
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:59.180]   And if Warren Buffett makes $100 million investment, it's practically irrelevant.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.500]   It's a blip on the radar screen.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.500]   It's not that big.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.400]   So he's got to put together billion-dollar deals.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.540]   The guy with $10 million that he's managing, so he buys a house for $150,000.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.060]   Let's just say he's practicing a flipping strategy.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:20.520]   Buys a house and flips it and he makes $50,000.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:26.140]   What impact does a $50,000 growth have on his $10 million portfolio?
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:30.660]   Not nearly as much as if a guy with a million dollars does that same deal.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.420]   So you've got to think and always apply the concept of scale to everything.
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:41.660]   So my investment capital is at a scale where I can work appropriately in the real estate
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.660]   market.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.180]   I won't invest so much of my money in any one deal that if a deal goes bad, it bankrupts
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.180]   me.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:54.340]   But I can still, with some creative real estate techniques, I can still make a big impact
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   in my experience and those deals are accessible to me.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.700]   I can get excellent returns.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.500]   So in the local real estate market, because it's inefficient, because I can put together
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:11.780]   the deals or I should, to be clear, I believe I can, I'm convinced that I can build the
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.780]   skill of doing it, whether or not I do it on the first deal or the first 10, I have
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.660]   no idea, but I'm convinced I can at least build the skill of doing it, then I can get
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:27.480]   really excellent returns, far in excess of what I can expect by investing in – far
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:33.300]   in excess of what I can expect by buying a mutual – an index fund from Vanguard.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:38.820]   And another important thing is I can use in real estate, I can use financial leverage
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.660]   safely.
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:46.060]   This was one of the things I was most intrigued by when I wanted to go and go to Shab's seminar
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:53.820]   was in my interview with him on radical personal finance, he talked about putting together
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:56:00.700]   deals with low money down and he talked about purchase – buying and selling properties
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:07.100]   but in a way that you're not giving a personal guarantee for the loan and that you're not
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.100]   working with a bank.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.180]   And what was interesting I learned, he said in the seminar, and he didn't make a big
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:17.500]   point of this in his book, it came out in the interview on radical personal finance
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.900]   here, but he didn't make a big point of it in the book, but he's been a real estate
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:26.060]   investor for 40 years, bought and sold a ton of properties, but he's never borrowed money
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:31.420]   from a bank and he's never given a personal guarantee on the property.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:36.380]   Now he's also never defaulted on a loan and he's always paid every single loan, but I
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.680]   didn't understand his strategy for doing that.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.400]   Now after attending his seminar I do and I'll cover that more in the future.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:48.460]   But I can use financial leverage safely with the amount of capital that I have to control
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.780]   valuable assets and that'll be really, really good.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:57.100]   And real estate leverage is unique in the world of leverage.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.860]   In stocks if you have a margin call that can wipe you out.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:06.300]   In real estate your risks are limited if you're using appropriate financing mechanisms with
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.700]   careful protections.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:14.060]   And then with Schaub's system he focuses on the middle market system and by putting
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:20.180]   together the deal one of my investment criteria is I need to make sure that I'm only doing
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.300]   deals that are going to be keeping me out of physical construction work.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:28.020]   So that means I'm not interested in flipping houses, I'm not interested in buying run-down
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:31.460]   houses and fixing them up, I'm not doing that type of thing.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.680]   I'm putting together a different type of deal.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:38.380]   And also by working at the middle market, if you go back and listen to his interview
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.180]   on Radical Personal Finance he talks about the time that he has off because he's built
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:46.420]   a very low maintenance landlording business.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.820]   So he does a really good job with that.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:54.420]   And then I think that also the reason I'm pursuing this now is I personally think this
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:58:02.660]   is a unique time in my lifetime for me to have some breakout years in my own personal
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.660]   wealth.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:10.860]   As I record this here in January 2016 my guess and my bet that I've been making, and I'm
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:16.640]   not an economist, I have no credentials or track record of any kind to point to where
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:22.020]   you should listen to my prediction, I'm just telling you my opinion today.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:31.540]   But my best guess is that I think that we'll be back in a recession in this year, next
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.620]   year, next couple, three years.
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.140]   We're overdue for a recession.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:39.820]   Now I wasn't in a situation in the last couple of recessions that I've been through as an
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:40.820]   adult.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.620]   I wasn't in a situation where I could take advantage of them.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:50.740]   I didn't either have, in 2001 I was in college and I didn't have any money and so whatever.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:56.900]   2006 and 2008 and that whole long period there, depending on when you technically want to
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:02.700]   use for your years to measure recession in, I was also still building a new business and
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.260]   I had invested all my money in that business.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.540]   So I didn't have a lot of investment capital and I didn't have things squared away.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.620]   So I wasn't able to really take advantage of them.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:14.500]   I didn't have a ton of money that I could sink into the stock market at lows or anything
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   like that.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:22.260]   But what I am convinced of by studying history is that a lot of people get, excuse me, a
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.980]   lot of people go broke in a recession, but some people get very, very rich.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:32.580]   And if you look at many of the great names, many fortunes were built in something like
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.220]   the Great Depression.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:40.340]   So recessions and depressions can be times of opportunity if you're paying attention
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.620]   and if you are stable.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.820]   So that's why I've done so much work on radical personal finance to try to help and encourage
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.980]   and give all the tools and ideas that I can think of to help you be stable.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.860]   That's one of the reasons why I've worked really hard to build financial stability in
[00:59:54.860 --> 01:00:01.060]   my life with, it's one of the reasons why I sold my house, take the profits and build
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.700]   that resilience and build that stability.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:09.340]   So I'm at a point now where if necessary, if I start, if you guys as listener base,
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:16.820]   you guys get to a point where you're suffering financially and we go into recession or depression,
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.620]   and let's say if it's severe and difficult and you guys have to start cutting back, well,
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.140]   I've built, I've tried to work hard on my own personal finances to keep my obligations
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.860]   to the bare minimum.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.020]   That gives me flexibility.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.620]   And so I am determined that whenever the next recession is, whether I'm right and it's this
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.460]   year or next year, who knows, somewhere in this next two or three years, whenever it
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:45.700]   is, I need to be ready and prepared to take advantage of the opportunities wherever they
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.940]   are.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.540]   I think there'll be opportunities in my local real estate market, but I can't wait.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:58.580]   I can't wait for us, you know, for 20, let's say that next year, 2017, we wind up in recession
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:00:59.580]   in the U.S.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.460]   Well, and then that trickles through, trickles through, trickles through.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:08.260]   And then 2018, 2019, that starts to be felt in my local real estate market.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.220]   People getting foreclosed on, people are losing their jobs.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.260]   And then there's just this general downturn.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:18.000]   I can't wait until 2019 to say, oh, OK, I'm going to become a real estate investor and
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.500]   start educating myself and preparing for it.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   That doesn't work.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.660]   It's too late because I don't know the skills.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:23.660]   I don't have the network.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.660]   I don't have the strategies.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.340]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:32.140]   So what I've got to do now is focus in 2016 on working hard, shopping my market, getting
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:39.100]   in tune with the market, finding deals, looking for them so that if I'm right, and this is
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:44.220]   again just my guess and my opinion, if I'm right and a couple, three, four years from
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:52.580]   now we are either in, going into, in or past a significant recession, if I'm right in that
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.180]   situation, then I've got the skills and I can profit from it.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.580]   And so I've got to build my strategy in a way that allows me to profit from it because
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:07.540]   my hope is whenever the next recession is, my hope is to come out of it in a much better
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:15.900]   shape than I went into it because I was prepared and looking for it.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.980]   I think there'll be some cool opportunities and I think that will be, I think there'll
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.740]   be some, just some things that we can use and implement.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.140]   I think we've got some cool opportunities coming up with this approach.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:31.820]   So that's why I've been focusing on, that's why some of the reasons, the transitions I've
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:37.900]   made, that's why I sold my house, selling my house cut my expenses, lowered my risk,
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.420]   freed up investment capital.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.760]   It was just across the board, all part of this plan.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.580]   That's why I've been bringing the content that I've been bringing, that's what I've
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:50.180]   chosen and I'm going to be bringing you guys on, I'll be bringing you guys on the journey
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.180]   with me.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.260]   It's one of the cool things about Radical Personal Finance, everything integrates.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.640]   As I study and learn strategies, I can share them and teach them with you.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:04.240]   As I share them and teach them to you, that will help the listenership of the show.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.780]   That will result in me being able to charge higher prices for my advertisers.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.660]   That'll result in more listeners to the show, which will help and more of you supporting
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.060]   the show on Patreon, which will help me.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:19.220]   And then I can leverage that and turn that into more investment assets.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.820]   And all along the way, it's built together.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:27.180]   Even one of the things about investing in real estate is the steps that I've been making
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.460]   towards being able to invest in private business is trying to build my local network much more
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.460]   proactively.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:36.260]   For the last couple of years, I've been slow about building my local network.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:41.900]   Well, real estate gets me out in my local community, has me building that local network,
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:47.400]   has me focused on connecting with other investors so that when there are opportunities and people
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.620]   need money, then they'll be calling me.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.620]   That's one step of the plan.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.220]   Hopefully this is useful to you.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:58.580]   Again, it's always hard for me to know what to share and what not to share, but I've tried
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:03.460]   to be very open.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.480]   I've tried to be open because you can learn from either what I'm right about or what I'm
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   wrong about.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.660]   If I make mistakes, you can pick those things up.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.820]   I think hopefully it'll be encouraging to some of you.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:21.920]   That's my plan as far as why I've chosen going forward to be working on real estate investments.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   Make your plan.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:28.060]   Your plan may be similar to mine or it may be exactly the opposite, but I encourage you
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.560]   to think through your plan.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.140]   What are the things you want in your investment plan?
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.080]   What are you looking for and what are the strategies that are going to help you?
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.220]   Hope this content has been useful today for you.
