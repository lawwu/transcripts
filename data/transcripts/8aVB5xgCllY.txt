[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Advice number three is to measure passion, not progress.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.480]   So most of us get an average of about 27,000 days of life.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.200]   I think a good metric by which you should live
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.000]   is to maximize the number of those days
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.600]   that are filled with a passionate pursuit of something,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.960]   not by how much you've progressed
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.200]   towards a particular goal.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.220]   Because goals are grounded in your comparison
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.820]   to other human beings,
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.080]   to something that's already been done before.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.500]   Passionate pursuit of something
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920]   is the way you achieve something totally new.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.560]   And a quick warning about passion.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.920]   Again, I'm a little bit of Russian,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.420]   so maybe I romanticize this whole
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.880]   suffering and passion thing.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.160]   But the people who love you,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.780]   the people who care for you,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.880]   like I mentioned, your friends, your family,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.400]   should not be trusted.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.360]   Accept their love, but not their advice.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.140]   Parents and significant others
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080]   will tell you to find a secure job
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.960]   because passion looks dangerous.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.880]   It looks insecure.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.760]   Advisors, colleagues will tell you to be pragmatic
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.280]   because passion looks like a distraction
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.620]   from the main effort that you should be focusing on.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.440]   And society will tell you to find balance,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.840]   work-life balance in your life
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980]   because passion looks unhealthy.
