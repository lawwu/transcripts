[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Here's another question from the Passion Conference
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.240]   we received from a podcast listener.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.480]   Pastor John, I was at the Passion Conference
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.520]   where you spoke.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.720]   I heard many people, college students mostly,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.720]   say things such as, "Piper just talks right over my head,"
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.640]   or, "He is too hard to understand."
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.160]   Why do you think so many people
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.520]   respond that way to your teaching?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.040]   - Oh dear.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.200]   Well, let's just be honest.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   It could be that I'm confusing.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.840]   It could be that I'm muddle-headed.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.000]   I don't really know what I mean.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.680]   I mean, people can't help others understand what they mean
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.320]   if they don't know what they mean.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.080]   It could be that I don't take the time necessary
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.960]   to make things as simple and understandable
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.600]   as they ought to be, that I'm unprepared, unclear.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.200]   So yeah, that's possible.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.900]   I will let others be the judge.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.900]   I certainly work hard to be clear and to be cogent.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.460]   And to be interesting.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.740]   I don't aim to be hard to understand.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.260]   That's not one of my goals.
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.100]   (laughs)
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.300]   That would be a bad goal.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.220]   I wanna be hard to understand.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.020]   Get a reputation of being unintelligible.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.300]   No, that's not what I'm after.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.660]   But here's another possible explanation.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.820]   And it's probably a combination.
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.820]   I think the main reason is that the educational bar
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.260]   has been set so low for children in elementary school
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.680]   and high school and at home,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.660]   there's no great premium put on thinking.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.260]   Thinking is work.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.540]   It really is.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.620]   In a sense, the mind is a muscle.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.100]   Like the biceps are a muscle.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   Your arm will just lie there, right?
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.080]   Just lie there in your lap.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   Until you make the mental effort to say,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.100]   "Bicep, lift my arm."
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.900]   And then the bicep does what you say.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.020]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.860]   It does.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.780]   But you have to make this effort.
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.420]   Now that's a small effort.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.020]   There are other things that require large effort.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.500]   Like if you've got a 50 pound weight in your hand
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.860]   and you say, "Bicep, lift it."
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.300]   Then that's gonna be a little more difficult.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.100]   It's the same with your mind.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.160]   It just lies there until you make the effort
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   to set it to thinking.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.960]   And most people's minds just lie there
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040]   and passively receive stimuli from television
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.400]   or entertaining speakers.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   But if someone comes along
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240]   and they start weaving an argument,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.440]   and what they say at one point is required
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.240]   for understanding what they say at the next point
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.320]   is required for what they say at the next point,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.840]   then the mind has to be told, "Hey, get up.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.020]   Wake up, work, listen.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.780]   Gotta put this together, put the pieces.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.420]   He's building something here.
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.520]   If you miss the first two,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.980]   the third one will dangle in the air.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.380]   Follow this chain of reasoning."
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.300]   And most people are not accustomed to doing that.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.260]   And they don't want to make the effort.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.220]   We're all by nature mentally lazy.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.820]   Children need to be taught the joy
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.400]   and the great benefits of overcoming this laziness
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   and making the discoveries that only thinking can make.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.080]   So someone might say, "Well, given this reality then
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.800]   in your audience, why don't you adjust
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.560]   and change your way of speaking
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.120]   so that more understanding can happen?
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.040]   And here are my reasons
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.960]   for not adjusting any more than I do.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.220]   And I don't claim to have the adjustment perfect,
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.900]   but here are the reasons.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.640]   Number one, the Bible reasons.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.340]   I would be untrue to the Bible
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.340]   if I did not create the lines of reasoning in the Bible.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.180]   The Bible is a demanding book, really demanding.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.820]   Even the parts that are simple at one level
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.820]   are profoundly challenging at another level.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.140]   If I were to constantly communicate to the people,
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.020]   you don't need to make an effort
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.260]   in order to understand the truth.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.040]   I would lie to them about what's required
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.680]   in reading the book of Romans or the book of John
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.740]   or the book of Isaiah or the Psalms.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.580]   It is a demanding book.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.900]   You must ask about the relationships
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.760]   of one clause to the next.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.820]   Otherwise you will miss the meaning.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.540]   Number two, I think God has called me
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.420]   to lift the level of thinking about God,
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.100]   not simply to adjust to how low it is.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.020]   And number three, the Bible itself demands
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.300]   that we think when it comes to discerning
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.900]   the meaning of God's word.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.940]   For example, 2 Timothy 2:7,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.540]   "Think over what I say,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.740]   for the Lord will give you understanding."
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.460]   It doesn't say, "You don't need to think
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.460]   because the Lord will give you understanding."
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.860]   It says, "Think because the Lord,
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.100]   through your thinking, will give understanding."
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.960]   Or 1 Corinthians 14, 20,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   "Be infants in evil, but in your thinking, be matures."
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.980]   That's what I wanna say to this generation.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.340]   In your thinking, don't be babies.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.340]   They just wait for mama's breast
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.820]   and then they suck as though
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.380]   no effort were required to think.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.780]   No, you are now grownups.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.540]   You must think.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.200]   And here's a fourth thing that comes to mind.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.340]   The people who are willing to make the effort
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.540]   to follow a train of thought
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.420]   are generally the kind of people
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.940]   who will be leaders someday.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.020]   They are the people I am most eager to persuade.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.820]   They will be the influencers.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.180]   People who mentally coast
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.420]   and don't put out the effort to think things through
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.280]   are generally followers.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.580]   That's what they are by nature
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.660]   because they want other people to think for them.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.780]   They don't want to do it for themselves.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.620]   They want others to think
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.300]   and then provide them conclusions.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.860]   And those won't be leaders.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.740]   That's just the definition of leader
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.420]   is you outthink the people that are following you.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.340]   I'm eager to win over thinkers
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.660]   because they will be the leaders.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.700]   So I'll always keep working.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.700]   I'm gonna try.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.540]   I'm gonna try.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.880]   I want people to understand what I'm saying.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.340]   I wanna be as understandable,
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.740]   intelligible as possible,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.420]   but not at the cost of losing the depth and richness
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.620]   that come from following the lines of thought in the Bible.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.460]   - That's good, Pastor John.
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.740]   So to paraphrase Peter,
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.140]   there are just some things in Piper
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.300]   that are hard to understand.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.860]   - I'm glad to be associated with Paul.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.820]   I wouldn't presume that.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.340]   - All right, excellent.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.500]   Another episode on this topic
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.940]   is one titled Childlike, Not Childish,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.060]   where you explain how intellectual development
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.460]   should work to make us increasingly more childlike
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.580]   in our faith.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.140]   That's episode 135.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.660]   We'll be back tomorrow to answer the question,
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.740]   is it possible for a husband to lust after his own wife?
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.180]   It's never boring around here.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.940]   See you tomorrow.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
