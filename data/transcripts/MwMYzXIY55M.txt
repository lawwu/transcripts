[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380]   So today I'm going to argue that we misunderstand the impact of how we obtain information on
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.820]   the overall quality of our lives.
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.660]   So I'll start by explaining this current model and why it's broken.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.720]   I'll then introduce a new philosophy that I call intentional information that I think
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.480]   promises to improve the quality and depth of your life almost right away.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.380]   Alright, so I want to start by explaining our current understanding of information and
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.380]   how we use it.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.380]   I'm going to try to draw this.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.860]   For those who are watching instead of just listening, God help you because I'm about
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.340]   to try to illustrate a very complicated topic with a pretty simple picture.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.500]   So what I'm drawing here, I'll narrate this for people who are listening, I'm drawing
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460]   a representation of you or me, a person, right?
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.340]   So for those who are watching, you can see the picture.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.220]   For those who are listening, Jesse, would we say that this picture reminds you sort
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.220]   of like a Caravaggio painting?
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.220]   Van Gogh.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.220]   Van Gogh.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.220]   Because I'm not familiar with Caravaggio.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.340]   Well, I'm just talking about, I'm being pretty subtle in my use of charoscuro, which is the
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.300]   use of light and dark contrast to try to give volume and shape.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.460]   For those who are listening, they don't really realize what I've drawn here.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.460]   Alright, so here's us.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460]   I've drawn a picture of us.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.740]   And over here, I'm drawing a picture of the world, expertly drawn circle.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740]   Everyone agrees.
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.980]   So there's like land in the world.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.860]   Okay, so here's the, here's the world and this picture of the world, I wanted to stand
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820]   in for an objective reality.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.620]   This is our current model of information.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.420]   We have us and we have this objective reality, the world that has people and events and things
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.220]   and theories that explain what's going on.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.320]   So there's sort of this like objective world that's out there.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.780]   The way we like to think about information is that what it does is it just gives us samples.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.020]   I'm drawing like an arrow from this world over towards the person.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.620]   It gives us sort of a sampling of what's happening in this objective world.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.940]   And this is a thought bubble I've just drawn here.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.300]   And inside this thought bubble, we sort of have constructed our own sort of lower quality
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.380]   model of what's happening in the world.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.080]   So like, you know, as we get sort of samples of information, as I'm representing by these
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.200]   arrows, we learn things about the world.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.360]   We use that to make our internal model of the world, people, places, things, and the
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.440]   theories that help explain how they all interact.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.500]   It helps make that model fuller, right?
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.600]   And so then how does technology enter this, this picture, it is the, the medium by which
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.040]   this information gets to us.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.720]   So like maybe we have like a newspaper expertly drawn, right?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.160]   So the newspaper is sort of mediating some samples about what's happening in the world.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.840]   Our image of the world gets more detailed.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.680]   When we move on to more modern technology, sort of the standard techno optimist sort
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   of perspective, I'm drawing here an expertly drawn smartphone.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.920]   The idea is like, oh, this just gets more information available.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.560]   So now that we have something like smartphones, we can have social media and the internet
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.720]   behind this all, we can get a lot more samples of this world.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.380]   And so our internal understanding of the world becomes even more detailed.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.400]   This internal understanding of the world then shapes how we, not just how we understand
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.720]   the world, but how we feel and we use as the foundation for our actions.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.200]   So we act based on the conceptions in our mind.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.640]   The conceptions in our mind are built up by getting these samples of information about
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   what's actually happening.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.820]   This is the model we currently have, right?
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.280]   So in this model, the sort of the techno optimist philosophy here is, well, more information
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.640]   is better than less because more information just gives you a more realistic and detailed
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.880]   understanding of what's actually going on in the world.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.280]   And the more detailed understanding you have, then sort of like the more your actions can
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.160]   be based in reality.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.460]   Why would you ever want a lower fidelity understanding of the world?
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.260]   More information can only be strictly better.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.920]   This is like a standard sort of techno optimist or even like an enlightenment mindset.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.280]   So in this idea, yeah, new technology that expose you to more information.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Great.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.680]   You get more detail to understand the world can only help you make more nuanced or correct
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.080]   or appropriate decisions about how to understand, feel and act.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.160]   All right.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.540]   So I'm going to argue that this model is quite broken.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.880]   This is not actually the way information works.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.720]   So it turns out that one of the most commonly occurring and deepest ideas in techno criticism
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.680]   is the notion that the tools we use to take in information impact the information itself,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.280]   how we receive it and how we understand what it means.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.980]   The tools are not just a neutral gateway that allows more samples from some objective world
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.980]   to get to us.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.920]   The tools themselves shape how we understand the information that the tools deliver.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.580]   So I want to sort of sample the world of techno critics that have talked about this before.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.580]   So you have a deeper sense of where this comes from.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.460]   A really cool, very old example of this comes from a book I'm reading right now by Jonathan
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.180]   Sachs, the late Jonathan Sachs, former chief rabbi of the United Kingdom.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.340]   He wrote this really cool book in 2012 called The Great Partnership, Science, Religion and
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.400]   the Search for Meaning.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.980]   And in this book, he has a great example of exactly this idea that technology itself shapes
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.140]   the information, shapes the way you understand the information that it delivers.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.440]   So he talks about in this book, the very first alphabetic languages.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.880]   So of course, the first languages that written languages were, were idiogramic.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.020]   You have pictures that represent what they are, but we get the very first alphabetic
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.400]   languages where you have symbols standing in for sounds, right?
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.820]   That's what we think of as a modern language.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.080]   The very first is Proto-Scianic, which basically evolves pretty quickly into ancient Hebrew.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.780]   It's like sort of in the first phonic alphabetic languages.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.000]   The interesting thing about Hebrew, Sachs points out, is in ancient Hebrew, there's
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.060]   no vowels, okay?
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.340]   So you have to use the, the context of the writing to figure out a particular word, right?
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.260]   So it would be like, if an English, if we think about like our alphabet without vowels,
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.120]   if you see HT, there's a lot of different words that could be dependent on what vowels
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120]   you fill in.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.240]   It could be hat, it could be hut, it could be hate, it could be hit, right, hot.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.380]   So depending, HT by itself doesn't tell you what the word is, but if you, if you look
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.820]   at the, the full sentence or the full context, you can figure out, oh, this must be the vowels
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.220]   meant for this word.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.380]   Now Sachs points out, at the same time, Hebrew is also read right to left, which engages
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.300]   your, your right hemisphere of your brain, which makes sense because you have to take
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.940]   in context of all the context of the writing to try to figure out what's being said.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.740]   It's very holistic, contextual way of taking in information.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.340]   And Sachs points out this is the mode of thought that's been captured in ancient Hebrew wisdom
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.660]   traditions, in particular in Torah.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.140]   And then later when you look at like Mishnah, the sort of commentary on the Torah, it's
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.020]   all of this writing is written in a way that's very much based on context.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.580]   It's not breaking things down.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.140]   Here's, here's a six part understanding of this.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.500]   It's stories, multiple stories about the same thing.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.460]   The meaning of a particular story doesn't necessarily make sense unless you understand
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.140]   the broader context in which that story is made.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.260]   So he's arguing that the mode of thought you get in the Abrahamic faiths is dictated in
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.280]   part by the structure of the language technology.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.980]   So then let's compare this to what happens is the Phoenicians bring the, this alphabet
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.380]   over to Greece, it goes to ancient Greece where it evolves.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.320]   And when this alphabet gets to Greece, they do two things.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.740]   First they introduce vowels to it.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.260]   So now there's no guessing.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.700]   You know exactly what a word is because you have all the vowels, just like in English.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.420]   And then they shift from left to right.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.780]   And this is going to be, as Sacks points out, engaging the left hemisphere of the brain,
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.500]   which is much more analytical.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.460]   So in Greek writing, like our modern languages, like, you know exactly what each word is as
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.460]   you finish it.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.180]   So you have this sort of like precise building up of understanding as you move left to right
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.180]   across the text.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.620]   You don't need to sort of take in the whole context and then try to figure out what it
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.620]   means.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.900]   Sacks argues this is exactly a technology that gave way to philosophy and abstract reasoning,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.220]   logic, and eventually science.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:45.300]   So the way the language works impacted the way that we understood, went about understanding
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.860]   the world.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.940]   So putting in vowels and going left to right made things like philosophy and logic very
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.060]   natural.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.620]   Reading right to left without vowels made a more sort of holistic narrative contextual
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.260]   understanding of the world more natural.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.700]   The technology through which you were getting the information dictated how you understood
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.060]   the world or made sense of the world, a very ancient example of this.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.460]   In more modern times, we have, you know, Neil Postman is a great proponent of this perspective.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:20.260]   He basically took this idea from his mentor, Marshall McLuhan, and he evolved it.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.940]   His book from 1985, Amusing Ourselves to Death, Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.280]   is sort of one of the classic publicly accessible guides to this idea that technology shapes
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.900]   the way that we actually understand information.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.760]   The terminology he introduced was epistemic environment.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.280]   So the tech information technology defines the epistemic environment, which in turn impacts
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.620]   how we understand the world.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.400]   So in this book, he was talking a lot about television since that was the major information
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.680]   technology of the 1980s.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.040]   But here's a couple of quotes from Postman.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.500]   He says, each medium, so he's talking about communication, information mediums, each medium
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.040]   like language itself makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.280]   for thought, for expression, for sensibility.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.200]   So mode of discourse is like how we actually think and engage with the world is affected
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   by the medium.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.820]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:26.280]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.720]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.080]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.880]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   Check it out.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.820]   He goes on to say, we do not see nature or intelligence or human motivation or ideology
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:53.560]   as it, as it is, but only as our languages are and our languages are our media.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.760]   Our media are our metaphors.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.560]   Our metaphors create the content of our culture, right?
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.120]   So he's directly pushing back against the picture I drew earlier.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   The picture that had this common understanding of there's an objective world, and we're just
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.280]   getting samples of that world and the more samples we get, the more we understand the
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   objective world.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.640]   But Postman's saying, no, no, no, there is no it, and he puts it in quotation marks.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.100]   So we can't see things as it is, right?
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.440]   What we see is very much shaped by the media that we're using to actually get this information.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.080]   So the, it, uh, what it is actually changes depending on the media through which we're
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.360]   getting this information.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.940]   You're recording, you're writing about the world in ancient Hebrew is going to be a completely
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.160]   different conception of how to approach reality than if you're writing about the world using
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.920]   ancient Greeks.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.960]   Another interesting book is from 2009 that gives us sort of a neurological explanation
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:53.080]   for some of this is Winifred Gallagher's book wrapped attention and the focused life I write
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.560]   about wrapped in deep work, I believe.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560]   It's an interesting book.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.640]   It was influential for me.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.360]   A lot of people struggle with it because it's more essayistic, not as Greek, let's say it's
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   more Hebrew than Greek.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.520]   If we're going to have more Jerusalem than Athens, if we're going to use our previous
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.040]   metaphors here.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:16.000]   So it's more like essays and a little more flowery, flowery and literary than, you know,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.240]   a lot of people are used to, but there's some fantastic ideas, including some pretty serious
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.500]   neuroscience.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.680]   So a big argument Gallagher is saying in here is that your brain constructs its internal
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.720]   understanding of the world based on what it's paying attention to.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.440]   So depending on what you pay attention to, your brain's actual internally constructed
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.240]   idea of what the world is like and how you should feel about it changes.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.200]   So it's not like here's the, here's the objective world and we're just getting higher and higher
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.960]   fidelity pictures of it.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.160]   We construct this specific world, neurologically speaking, based on what we pay attention to.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.120]   Here's a quote from her book, all day long, you are selectively paying attention to something
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.000]   and much more often than you may suspect, you can take charge of this process to good
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   effect.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.120]   Indeed, your ability to focus on this and suppress this, that is the key to controlling
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.080]   your experience and ultimately your well being.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.820]   So now she's getting down to the mechanisms here, what you're paying attention to impacts
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.360]   how your mind understands what's happening to you in the world.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.040]   And that directly impacts your well being.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.400]   Okay.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.680]   So we put these ideas together, we get a completely different understanding.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.520]   I'm going to draw a new picture here again with great trepidation.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.720]   So going back, I'm going to, you know, let's draw our person again over here.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.320]   All right.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.800]   There's our person.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:45.700]   This is the reality is there's lots of different conceptual worlds that we potentially that
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.660]   exist out here.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:54.200]   And the specific world, the specific world that you're building an internal representation
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.800]   of in your mind depends on the technology you're using.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.840]   So if we're using a particular technology down here, we get one world if we use a different
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.320]   technology that our understanding the world is different, there is no objective world.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.640]   We sort of construct our understanding of the world and therefore our subjective sense
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.660]   of self beliefs and actions based on what information we're getting.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.080]   And as we learned from postman and sacks, the technology through which we're getting
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.060]   that information is what really matters in terms of the type of world that it constructs
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.660]   for us.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.920]   So that's the reality here.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.960]   And so in this case, this person is looking at the world through like a smartphone and
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:40.040]   perhaps you know, this world is one I'm putting like a nuclear explosion and it's like a and
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.160]   I'm putting devil ears on it.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.640]   It might be like a really bad world, you know, like, oh my God, right.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.540]   So it affects kind of looks like the monster from monsters, Inc.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.720]   The Billy Crystal says, anyways, that's the reality.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   So that matters.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   All right.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:02.080]   So if we take this all into consideration, the conclusion is if your goal is to build
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.400]   a deep life in this current distracted high tech world, you have to care a lot about the
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.120]   information you take in and through what tool you're taking in that information, right?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.520]   If our tools are not just these like neutral portals that just give us samples of the real
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   world as it is.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.960]   And so just the more samples, the better.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.900]   So why not use as many tools as possible?
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.000]   We have to care.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.600]   We have to care about how we take in information.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.240]   I have a name for this philosophy, a tentative name.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.360]   I call it intentional information.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.080]   Intentional information is a philosophy that having intention about what information you
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:41.560]   take in and how you take it in is really important on the quality of your life.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.480]   So I wrote down some potential principles here for intentional information.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.720]   This is all just, this is tentative, right?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.040]   I'm just writing down a few ideas here.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.440]   We can expand this as needed, but just to give you a sense of the type of ideas you
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.480]   might put in place.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.880]   If you adopt an intentional information philosophy, all right, number one, get non-local news
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.760]   typographically as boring as possible and sparingly, all right?
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.560]   So if you want to know about the world, be very careful about how you do this.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.960]   Don't just be on Twitter or Instagram or Tik Tok and see what comes through.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.000]   You have no control over the world that that's going to create in your head is probably not
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.520]   going to be a world that's going to be beneficial to you.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.120]   So typographically, that's a technology that's going to give you a much, I'm not going to
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.720]   say accurate, but it's going to give you a much less manipulated or charged understanding
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.480]   of the world.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.680]   Appealing news, just what's going on, bullet points of things that are happening.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.400]   I just sort of want to know what's going on, but I don't want it to be appealing, trying
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.880]   to get me to click or follow or subscribe to something.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.760]   And you don't probably need as much news about the world outside of your local environment
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   as you might think.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.540]   In your local environment, you do want to know what's going on, but you can actually
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.840]   get this information largely from actual people.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.200]   Spend much more, this goes with that idea too, spend much more time paying attention
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.240]   to what's going on in the worlds in which you have agency.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.920]   We're much more wired for this, the communities in which you are a part and actually have
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.640]   a say, your town, your school, your employer, your religious institution.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.240]   That should be actually like the bulk of the information you're taking in about what's
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.720]   going on because these are the worlds in which you have agency.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.960]   Our mind is better able to deal with that information because that's what information
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.640]   was until what, 300 years ago.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.480]   It was just about the worlds in which we have agency.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.680]   We have a really hard time hearing about the world beyond where we have agency because
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.800]   our mind is used to, if something bad is happening that affects us, we need to be worried or
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   we need to be a part of it.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.640]   And when the information is coming in from the entire billion, many billion person world,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.380]   we can't actually do that, but our mind doesn't make that distinction.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.920]   So focus more on the notion of the world our brain is used to, which is the world in which
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.920]   you live and the people are in it that you know, and you can make a difference and you
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:01.360]   can, you can be involved and less time, not no time, but the bulk of your consumption
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   should not be.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.460]   I just want to hear about things that I have no agency or impact or control on prioritize
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.120]   real people over characters, right?
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.960]   So again, I think social media does this, YouTube does this.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.760]   You have to be careful that you kind of get these characters, these avatars of people
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.560]   designed to be interesting, and it messes with how we understand what people are like
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.240]   and what we should be like.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.200]   So spend more time with real people that you actually talk to and know and can see and
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.080]   touch, especially if you're young.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   This is important.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.440]   Being around real people gives you a better grounding in the reality of the human experience
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.560]   than paying, you know, spending most of your time with these avatars online, prioritize
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.360]   real action over watching action of others.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.280]   So again, it's, there's weird, crazy stuff going on online and people doing these things
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   on Tik TOK videos.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.760]   And it's sort of a simulacrum of interesting activity and it can play weird things with
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   our minds prioritize.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.160]   Like I want to go do something myself.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.480]   I want to be a part of this trail maintenance club.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.600]   I'm part of the running club.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.360]   I'm volunteering at this thing here.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.920]   I'm writing in this writing group where we get together in a real place, prioritize real
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   action over.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.120]   Let me get a thrill out of watching vicariously over watching the actions of others.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   Try to have, I think of this like medicine.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.920]   When you get exposed, despite your best efforts to material that is very emotionally engaging,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.400]   especially if the material gets you outraged about something, the medicine you want to
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.200]   try to take right away to, to dole the more insidious effects of this emotion that could
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   really creep in.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.040]   I mean, nothing really shapes that world in our head stronger than a sense of, of, of
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.640]   injustice or outrage, which injustice is important, but you want to make sure that if you're getting
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:52.440]   this through a format that is meant to amplify those feelings that you put a sort of a dampener
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440]   on it.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.400]   And the best dampener is steel Manning.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Okay.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.640]   I've, I've encountered this thing that's really making me upset.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:05.880]   Let me go seek out and encounter the best, best faith sort of presentation of this from
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.600]   the other side of it.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.960]   What you get here is not like, Oh, it's going to trick you.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.240]   Oh, it's going to, it's going to trick you into not caring about what's important or
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   it's going to, to dole your sense of needing to take action.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   Things are, that's not at all.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   What's going to happen.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.080]   What this actually ends up doing is when you put the, the, the best steel man, that's what
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.720]   they call instead of a straw man, like the best, a good faith argument from the other
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.240]   sides is it sands off the, the, the really sharp edges that actually can make any reasonable
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.880]   action difficult and allows you to actually work with what's going on in this particular
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   instance in a much more productive way.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.200]   So take this dose of steel Manning for everything that outrages you, everything that really
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.320]   gets you going.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.840]   It just changes the temperature of your internal world and makes you a, it gives you more options,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.580]   gives you, gives you more agency.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.080]   That one scares people.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.480]   Interestingly, though, when I talk about this, it doesn't scare individuals thinking about
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   themselves.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   Like, like, yeah, that's fine.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.560]   I can see a good faith argument about something and it'll be good to know.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.360]   It's not going to change what I think about, but they get worried about other people.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.920]   They'll be tricked.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.480]   It's important that they don't see the other side because they could be tricked into believing
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   the wrong thing.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.760]   It doesn't happen.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.360]   You believe in something steel Manning, it just gives you a more nuanced, less emotionally
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.720]   charged understanding of it.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.040]   That is the foundation for real action.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.360]   When you really just pick up the outrage, that's the foundation for sending more tweets
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.560]   and doing more tick tock videos.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.720]   You're basically serving the social media companies.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.520]   You're not actually serving the world.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.480]   Be wary about using social media for entertainment.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:43.360]   You'll find a instead what I call slow entertainment consumption of information that slower and
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   builds more richer, more rewarding worlds, books, good movies, seeing music in person,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.320]   being around artists or creatives or seeing something awe inspiring in nature and person.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.540]   Slow entertainment is going to be much richer for the brain and give us probably a better
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.360]   construction of a world than using social media for entertainment.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.240]   If you do use social media for entertainment, be very focused.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.560]   Like this particular thing I get from social media.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.960]   It's not just a, I'm bored.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.840]   Let me start scrolling.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.760]   So it could be, I like to look at these baseball commentators during baseball game.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   They have like interesting comments about what's going on.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.440]   That's fine.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.720]   But I'm going to scroll tick tock when I'm just waiting at a red light.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.920]   That's a whole different type of thing.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.000]   Finally, seek a regular drip of content that's optimistic, exciting, or inspiring.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.040]   So if the information we take in shapes our understanding of the world, then why don't
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   we take in information that's going to shape an understanding of an immediate world that
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.420]   is a little bit more positive, inspiring, because we will feel better.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.080]   So if this is what matters, then let's, let's be careful about the information we choose.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   All right.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.500]   So that's some principles off the top of my head.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.000]   But the bigger point here with intentional information is this notion that information
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   is not neutral.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.400]   The tool shapes what the information means to you.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.840]   And a lot of the tools that exist out there now, these internet based attention economy
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.800]   tools tend to shape a version of the world that is not in our best interest.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.880]   It's distracting.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.500]   It's emotionally draining.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.940]   It makes us feel bad.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.540]   It cuts off our options for actually taking meaningful action.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.400]   So a deep life is careful about its information.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.240]   What information it takes in and critically through what medium or tool it takes in that
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.680]   information.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.760]   Intentional information is one in where you're probably actually taking in a lot less digital
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.960]   information than you are now.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.100]   You're putting more of that attention towards slower or in-person type of information.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.460]   This is an immediate positive change to your understanding of the world.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.180]   Intentional information can have you, as one listener said to me, feel like you're going
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.060]   from black and white to technicolor.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.340]   It changes the world that you live in.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.940]   It changes what Postman would have called your epistemic environment in a way that can
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.200]   be profound and almost immediately.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.660]   So we have to care about the information we intake just as much as we care about the other
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.020]   aspects of our life.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.940]   So there you go, Jesse.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.140]   Intentional information.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.040]   Not just two words now, but alliteration.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.740]   So we're really rock and rolling.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.340]   Reading right to left is like blowing my mind.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.740]   I never even knew about that.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.700]   So if you've never picked up a book in Hebrew, you start from the other end.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.140]   I've never picked up a book in Hebrew.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.140]   I had to do that.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.140]   It is really...
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.140]   It's a cool book.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   I like Sachs.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.140]   I've been reading a lot of Sachs recently.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.420]   He's one of these scholars who's very broadly read, but is very good at writing for popular
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   audiences.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.220]   He doesn't dumb it down, but he also doesn't trip up over his own complexity.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.620]   He's not proud of, "Look how smart I am."
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.660]   And somehow he's just able to pull all these different things together, be really clear
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.300]   about it, summarize what matters, know that this is a simplification, make that clear
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.200]   and keep moving.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   Really good.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   Really smart thinker.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   Mm-hmm (affirmative).
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   Rabbi Sachs.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   All right.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.180]   Anyways, we've got some good questions now vaguely about these topics, deep life topics,
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.180]   information, et cetera.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.860]   But first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:12.640]   Speaking of information, I think it's a good time to talk about our friends at Notion.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.180]   So you should know about Notion already.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.540]   It's a tool that combines your notes and documents into one space that's simple and beautifully
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.020]   designed.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.500]   It also allows you to create these sort of custom information spaces.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.060]   We have used Notion-based tools here at the Deep Work HQ for various reasons.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.300]   We had, for example, I believe we were using it to keep track of, with our advertising
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.180]   agency, all the different advertisers and when the reads were.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.300]   And Notion makes it, you can build these beautiful interfaces and view the data in different
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.000]   ways and zoom in here.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.780]   If you deal with a lot of information and what you do professionally, Notion is a tool
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.140]   for building these fantastic custom interfaces into that information.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.140]   All right.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.540]   So we've talked about Notion before on the show.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:59.580]   One of the problems, of course, in general, is as information gets more voluminous, whatever
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.780]   operation you're running, it's more and more difficult to find what you need.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.220]   So this is where I want to talk about this new tool that Notion has built right into
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:16.740]   its product, an AI tool built right into the product that makes it very easy to find whatever
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.780]   you're looking for.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.780]   It's really cool.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.980]   We've been messing around with this.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.540]   It's a fantastic idea.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:31.620]   You can use the Notion's AI-powered workspace to ask, where is this document on whatever?
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.900]   Where was it that we had the summary from the last meeting?
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.260]   It can also act on your behalf because Notion, these tools get you a place to interface with
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.020]   and mess with your information.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.300]   So it can help you with this.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.140]   Hey, can you summarize the notes from this meeting?
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.500]   I put in these meeting notes, summarize those for me.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.620]   Can you generate action items based off this transcript of a chat that I just pasted right
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.100]   into our Notion interface?
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.100]   Asking questions.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:07.940]   What did we say last week in the meeting about what we were going to do?
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:13.060]   The AI-powered tools in Notion can help you with all of these different things.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.820]   So I love this idea that Notion has evolved from the tool to build custom interfaces,
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.540]   to deal with all the information you need to do what you or your organization does.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.340]   And now with AI integrated deep in it, it's all the more easier to find what you need,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.800]   to create the information you need, to summarize the stuff that you have in there.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.280]   So it's made this tool all the more powerful.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   So here's the good news.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.560]   You can try Notion for free when you go to notion.com/cal.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:43.740]   That's all lowercase letters, notion.com/cal and start turning ideas into action.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.180]   And when you use this link, you will be supporting our show.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:52.080]   So go to notion.com/cal.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:59.340]   Another cool sponsor I want to talk about, a relatively new sponsor to the show is Listening.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:05.260]   So Listening is this fantastic tool that allows you to take, I use it with academic articles,
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.460]   but basically written text.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:17.820]   And Listening is a tool that uses AI-generated voices so that you can listen to written material.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:23.020]   So now you can take in this material like you would a podcast or an audio book.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.580]   Here for example is an academic article I want to read about whatever, I'm busy, Listen
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:34.300]   can now read this article for me while I'm doing the dishes, while I'm mowing the yard.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.020]   So it's a way to take things that weren't originally recorded to be audio and allow
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.980]   you to actually consume them in an audio format.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:48.980]   So you can listen to papers, books, PDF, websites, email, newsletters, et cetera.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.260]   And the Listening app does this really well.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.020]   One of the cool things about this is it has the ability to, it sounds like a real human,
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.860]   but one of the things I like about it is a one-click note-taking function.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.980]   So like, "Oh, I need to jot something down about this that you're listening to."
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:09.740]   You press one button, boom, and you can throw in a note and it will remember, take the last
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:14.180]   things it read and put it, copy it over into this sort of notepad type feature.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.180]   I don't know what they call it.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.740]   So these notes are there.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.980]   So like if I'm listening to an academic article or like a long form, you know, New Yorker
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.540]   piece while I'm doing the dishes, if there's something in that article, like, ooh, that's
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.500]   a key part, hit the button.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.700]   It grabs the last few sentences, throws it in my notepad.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.340]   And then later I can go in and be like, "Oh, here's the things I sort of audio highlighted
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.020]   from this thing I was listening to."
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.760]   So they know, the listening app knows that like you want to actually take notes or keep
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.960]   information or remember good stuff about what you were listening to.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.640]   It's also really good about skipping through sections.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   So it understands like if you've digested a academic paper, what the sections are.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.240]   So you can jump ahead to conclusions, jump ahead to results, and it'll start reading
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   that to you.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240]   And I like the voices.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.620]   I think they're the AI voice technology.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.620]   I don't know.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.580]   I feel like in the last six months, it feels like this has really changed where, you know,
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.320]   it sounds like someone is actually reading it.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.560]   So your life just got a lot easier.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.920]   Normally you'd get a two-week free trial, but my listeners are going to get a whole
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:22.040]   month free if they go to listening.com/deep or use the code deep at checkout.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.720]   So go to listening.com/deep for a limited time, you can get a whole month free.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.240]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.600]   That listening comes in handy, especially if you're driving too.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   That's a fantastic use for it.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   Because there's so many times where I need to, and you can't write while you drive.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   That's fantastic, actually.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760]   Right?
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.680]   Like, okay, I want to read this article that might be relevant for something I'm working
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   on.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.400]   Use the listening app and you can listen to it while you drive and you can hit the note
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   taking button.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   I agree with that.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   All right.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   First question's from Mark.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.340]   Do you have any book recommendations aside from your own that will compliment cultivating
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.360]   a deep life outside of work?
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.040]   So far from the past, I've heard you talk about Walden in Designing Your Life.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.080]   I'd love to hear more you consider good reading before you release your next book, which is
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.600]   the Deep Life book.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.120]   So Mark, I want you to read nothing until my book on the Deep Life comes out.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.440]   Everything else compared to my book is garbage.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.960]   No, there's a lot of good books.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.040]   So I'm going to zig here, right?
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.880]   There's two ways of thinking about books about the deep life.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.860]   There's books you can imagine to be actually instructive, right?
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:40.140]   So like Designing Your Life or Tim Ferriss is like the Four Hour Work Week, right?
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140]   What's the Arthur Brooks book?
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.460]   We had Arthur on his book with Oprah, you know, building the life you want.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.580]   So you have straight up instructive books.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.860]   My book on the Deep Life will fall into that instructive bucket.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.300]   Like here's the way to think about this.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.300]   Here's what to do.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.520]   Try this out.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.540]   But I'm going to recommend something different for you now.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.880]   The other piece about reading about the deep life is not the instructions about how you
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.120]   construct a deep life, but instead your internal exploration to understand what the deep life
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.520]   means to you.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.600]   Like what is depth?
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.920]   This is actually the big question that people have now, you know, on the show, we say, first
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:19.320]   of all, life is too ambiguous of a term, break your life into the different areas that are
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.320]   important to you.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.440]   We sometimes call these buckets.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.960]   So let's do that first.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.760]   And, you know, you might have craft and community and constitution and contemplation celebration
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   at different ways.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.120]   We talk about this, but the areas of your life that's important to you.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.020]   So now life is something more general.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:40.940]   Then what you want to do is seek out in each of these areas of your life, examples that
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.780]   resonate.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.920]   So it could be something you read about, it could be something you, you hear on a podcast
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.720]   or something you see in a movie or a documentary or read in a magazine article, but you're
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.200]   trusting your own body's intuition.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.320]   You're using your body as a depth detector.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.800]   It knows like if it sees something that feels right in some way to me, I'm going to feel
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   that.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.920]   And so you start, you start to capture these examples.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.760]   And then once you have these examples and you're categorizing them, like the different
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.600]   parts of your life, once you have these examples, then you can distill them into properties.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.440]   Oh, so what are the properties that these examples have?
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   Let me distill those.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.560]   These are the properties I'm looking for in the working part of my life.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.560]   These are what resonate to me.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.760]   I've distilled at the properties.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.440]   Here's the properties I'm looking for in the community aspect of my life.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.800]   I had these sort of examples of people and things and these books I read that really
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   spoke to me.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.720]   What are the properties they all shared that I want in the community part of my life?
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.640]   Once you have those properties, now you have a portrait of your own goal as a deep life
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.460]   that you can start working on pursuing.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.320]   And that's going to be sort of fundamental to the book I'm writing on the deep life,
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.160]   the sort of lifestyle centric planning.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.360]   So with this in mind, though, this means this is another way to think about books is you're
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.840]   looking for things that resonate.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.520]   Then you're recording the things that resonate under the right categories.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.600]   And then later you tried to still prop properties out of them.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.820]   So you don't necessarily need to just be looking for instructions, but instead the raw material
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.640]   you'll later need to construct a deep life.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.100]   So Mark, that's what I might recommend.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.840]   Read things that speak to you.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.960]   And when you get that feeling of like I, whatever this person is doing, why I'm reading a book
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.500]   about Lincoln and something about Lincoln is resonating with me of what's happening
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.600]   with the way he's dealing with X.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.080]   Let me write that down.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.880]   I'm watching a documentary about Laird Hamilton, you know, big wave surfing on the North Shore
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   of Maui.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.600]   I don't know what about this is resonating, but something is I'm going to write this down.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:38.360]   So think about books in that way as a source of intuition into what matters to you.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.240]   And then, of course, we can later use that information to help construct a life that
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.360]   has those properties in it.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.300]   And that's the whole lifestyle centric planning.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   It's its own thing.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.520]   But anyway, I want to make that distinction.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.800]   Books in the deep life is not just about how do I build this, but it's what do I want to
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.080]   build, discovering what it is you want to build.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.240]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.920]   Next question's from Scott.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.800]   Do you think handwriting has a positive effect on cultivating a deep life?
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.680]   He provides a link that we'll take a look at.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.440]   He also goes on to say, you use your remarkable tablet, and that implies that you like writing
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   by hand.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.800]   Do you use it for reasons suggested in the article?
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.000]   All right, Scott, so we loaded up the article you sent to us.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.800]   I'll put it on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.320]   So the article that Scott sent us is titled Why Handwriting is Good for Your Brain.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:34.480]   There's a picture of someone writing at some sort of like colonial looking desk.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   All right.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480]   Analysis.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.120]   Research over the years has pointed out that there are many advantages and benefits to
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.440]   writing by hand.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   All right.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440]   All right.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   So there's some cool pictures in here.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.000]   I'm just kind of scrolling through this thing.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.040]   Look at that thing.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.200]   This is like a writing device, Jesse.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   This weird thing here.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.880]   It's a writing device that Nietzsche used.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.640]   Okay.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.240]   In a study carried out almost two decades ago, subjects were presented with words carrying
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.920]   a positive connotation, such as sweet, or negative, such as rubbish.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.160]   Subjects had to indicate whether a word was good or bad by moving a joystick.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.680]   Half the subjects were told to indicate that a word was good by pulling the joystick towards
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.720]   their body, and the other half were told to indicate good by pushing it away.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.520]   To indicate that a word was bad, they made the opposite movement to good.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.920]   A consistent correlation was observed between meaning and movement.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.120]   The quickest responses were produced by the subjects who were told to indicate good by
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.320]   pulling the joystick towards themselves and indicate bad by pushing it away.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.160]   The direct involvement of the body and senses and mental processes can explain how writing
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   by hand helps us learn letters and words.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.780]   This is backed up by the results of various studies, which they then go on to summarize.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   All right.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.080]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.280]   Do I use a remarkable notebook specifically to get benefits of handwriting?
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.240]   Not really.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   Not really.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.000]   There's two advantages I like to it.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Portability.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.280]   So handwriting is portable.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.220]   You just need a surface, right?
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:06.160]   Keyboards take space, and I can type much faster than I can write.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.160]   I take a lot of notes on my computer typing, so I can type much faster than I can write,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   but it's not portable.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.880]   So I like portability of handwriting.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.480]   I also like flexibility of formatting.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.620]   So in my remarkable, I underline things, I draw boxes, I draw arrows.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.080]   There's a lot of information that can be captured diagrammatically, right?
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.800]   Like I can draw things, captures information.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   I can underline things, box things, connect things with arrows.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.320]   There's a lot of extra information you can add with drawing in addition to just pure
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.260]   text.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.440]   So I like both those things about handwriting.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.520]   I don't know that I understand or remember information better when I write.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.680]   I'm frustrated that my writing is slow compared to my typing.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.960]   My handwriting tends to get sloppy.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.120]   Usually when I'm typing, just because my speed is better, I can get out more ideas.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.440]   I can develop them better.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.560]   I mean, I actually like typed thinking.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.840]   I feel like it's more flexible for me than writing, speaking.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.620]   But there's advantages to the handwriting, the portability, and the ability to add diagrams.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.200]   So I'm not a big booster of these notions that it will change my understanding if I
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.080]   write it as opposed to type it.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.560]   In my book, I talked about this, I'm remembering this now.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:19.040]   I talked about this in my straight A student book from years ago about how to be a student.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.200]   And I argued in that book, like, "Hey, if you're able to bring a laptop, if you have
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.840]   a laptop and are able to bring a laptop in the class to take notes, that's probably better
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.240]   because you can type faster."
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.760]   To me, it was all about keeping up, getting the information down that you can then later
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.040]   study from.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.560]   And so I think from, if I'm thinking back, even from my early days, I was a big fan of
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.880]   speed, speed and efficiency.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.800]   So I like typing, but I do handwrite because it has its advantages.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.520]   If I had better handwriting, Jesse, I would do it more.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.520]   Some people have beautiful handwriting, and there's like a draw, it's really nice.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.060]   They have these bullet journals that look very artistic.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.000]   My notebooks, if you looked at them, sort of look like you're capturing someone having
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.560]   a stroke in real time, just in terms of like the handwriting and the, so I get frustrated,
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.320]   like, "I want to go faster."
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.520]   Other than your $50 notebook back in the day.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.560]   That one I wrote carefully in.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560]   That one slowed me down.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.760]   That was in the book.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.680]   I get frustrated I can't type faster.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.560]   I type myself off of my keyboard.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.280]   I go so fast, I type myself off my, I want to go faster.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.320]   My thoughts move so much quicker than I can get information down, but that's true.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.200]   So in my high quality notebook, which I talk about in slow productivity, I spent a lot
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.800]   of money on this notebook when I was a postdoc, so I would take my thoughts more seriously.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.440]   My handwriting is very neat in there, so I did go slower in that notebook, and I did
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.440]   produce better ideas, so maybe there's something in that.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.400]   How's your keyboard holding up that you bought over the holiday season?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   I like it.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   My mechanical?
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.480]   Yeah, so it, by bouncing up the fingers, I'm faster.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.760]   I can type faster, but I still type myself off that keyboard.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.840]   I go faster than I can actually keep up.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.000]   So you still use it all the time?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   All the time.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.120]   So when I use GHQ, when I use our new beastly studio computer setup, I'll bring my mechanical
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.120]   and plug it in.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   I really do like writing on it.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   That's cool.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.960]   All right, next question's from Josh.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.080]   I have struggled with learning in school and work my whole life.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.280]   I struggle with comprehension, and my analytical and communication skills are terrible.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.840]   I'm 33, and this inability to move up in life and grow is affecting every aspect of my life.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.320]   I feel like I'm always working hard to no avail.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.520]   Should I get a brain scan to prove I have a low IQ?
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.360]   No, I don't think you need to measure your IQ.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.680]   I don't think you need a brain scan.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:43.200]   I think what we need to do here is lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.280]   So this is my key idea about the deep life is instead of fixating on particular specific
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:55.160]   goals that are appealing to you and hoping that those goals, if accomplished, will bring
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.840]   in their wake and appealing lifestyle, focus directly on the lifestyle that's appealing
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.920]   to you and see how do I engineer it.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.320]   When you focus on the aspects of your lifestyle that are appealing to you first and work backwards,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.520]   it opens up many more ways forward.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.880]   You have a huge diversity of ways forward, and most importantly, you can mix and match
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:20.880]   your ways forward towards this desirable lifestyle to actually conform to your opportunities
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.720]   and obstacles, which are very specific to you.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.160]   So I think lifestyle-centric plans is what's going to be good here, because I think in
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.920]   your mind, it sounds like you probably have these particular goals.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   I don't know.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.000]   I want to be higher up in this job, or I want to make this much money in this role, and
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   there's obstacles to it.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.760]   You're like, "I'm having a hard time getting there."
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:43.000]   Whereas in lifestyle-centric planning, you say, "Well, what do I actually want in the
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   different parts of my life?"
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.320]   It's not the specific job.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.960]   It's that I want to have this type of security and live in this type of place and have this
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.520]   sort of engagement with the community and spend this type of time.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.320]   You build this image of your life.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.400]   And now you can say, "What are my best ways to get there?"
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.040]   So if this particular type of work you're in, maybe it's involving certain types of
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.560]   very stylized business communication and lots of fast analytical thinking about analyzing
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   things, and if that is not fitting well with your skills, okay, let's find a different
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.440]   way to get towards what you're looking for.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.120]   The other thing you'll get out of lifestyle-centric planning is now you're working with your opportunities
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   and obstacles.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.600]   You can sort of work systematically to expand opportunities and reduce the obstacles.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.880]   So if you're having difficulty with reading comprehension, for example, there are things
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.640]   you can do to make that better.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.440]   Typically reading, building up a reading habit, starting with books that are incredibly appealing
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.920]   and easy and then sort of slowly pushing yourself on the complexity.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.520]   That changes your mind.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.400]   As your mind becomes a reading mind, it changes it.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:50.520]   Spending a lot less time with really high-distraction, high-salient attention-economy tools like
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.760]   things on your phone, spend a lot less time with that and more time with slow information
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.920]   and slow entertainment like books, like watching full movies, that'll rewire your brain in
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.820]   a way that will help.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.440]   If there's particular analytical skills, practicing those skills will help.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.360]   I want to actually practice doing this type of analysis, getting feedback, doing it better
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   next time.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.100]   So you can actually reduce obstacles and increase opportunities.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.480]   But all of this, I think, should be in the context of what do I want out of my life?
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.440]   Okay, what do I have available?
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   What opportunities do I have available?
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.440]   What are my obstacles?
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.040]   How can I expand those, reduce those?
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   Fine.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.080]   But let me work with what I can do well and figure out how to get closer and closer to
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.360]   these properties and the various parts of my life that appeal to me.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.000]   So I think the flexibility of lifestyle-centric planning is critical here.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.240]   Because otherwise, you might lock in on this is what I need to do, this job and this position
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.440]   and this job.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.540]   And if that's not working for you, all you're going to feel is frustration.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.540]   So that's what I would suggest there, lifestyle-centric planning, LCP.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.080]   You know me, LCP.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.480]   That's a good question.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.080]   All right, what else we got?
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.360]   All right, next question's from Esteban.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.280]   Do you recommend using ChatGPT for reading recommendations?
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   No.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.500]   I mean, ChatGPT has just digested a lot of information from people.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:19.040]   And then it is going to be remixing that in sort of arbitrary ways, unpredictable ways
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.480]   to try to produce a simulation of how like real people it encountered online would be
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.480]   recommending books.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.680]   I think it's better just to go straight to the source material that ChatGPT trained on.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.040]   People whose taste you find interesting or congruent, what type of books are they recommending?
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.080]   Trusting your own intuition, right?
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.100]   Like, what am I interested in right now?
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.600]   What are the parts of my life I want to understand better?
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.240]   What are the parts of the world that seem interesting to me that I want to know more
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   about?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   What are good books there?
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.360]   I feel like choosing nonfiction books, it's like this, especially nonfiction, it's this
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.080]   really subtle act.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.240]   You know, I'm constantly, it's a very subtle act when I'm choosing what I want to read
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   next.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.480]   And a lot of different things in my life come together to choose this book versus that book.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.000]   And it's really enriching to me.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.280]   And even the selection process itself is an act of self-development, self-definition.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.840]   So there's certain things like, yeah, this is great.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.760]   We can use a language model to make faster.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.900]   This is not something we need to make faster.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.280]   The more you have to define and understand what you want to read and why you want to
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.040]   read it as you get better at finding and making these selections, you are going to improve
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.600]   your own understanding of yourself.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.880]   So do not fall back on chat GPT for this because again, you're just getting, right, it's a
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   token generator.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.220]   So it's like, what would people that I've seen talking about books, what are the types
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.080]   of things they would say here?
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.460]   That's not going to be better than just actually going to people who talk about books and seeing
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.460]   what they're saying.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.820]   Because there you have a real mind with coherent agency on the other end of it that you can
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.800]   actually relate to as a human being and figure out how to place the recommendations in some
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.560]   sort of larger sociocultural context.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.120]   It's a very human thing.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.640]   I think it's something that's worth keeping more human.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.440]   All right.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   Let's see.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   Oh, we got another one.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.440]   Who else do we have here?
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.960]   Next question is from Anna.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.320]   How should I plan my gap year to ensure I don't waste a year?
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.520]   I want to experience the world, but fear I'll waste this opportunity.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:14.480]   Well, Anna, first of all, I just want to give you a little bit of reassurance.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.000]   I think relative to the length that you've been alive so far, the gap year feels like
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.480]   a large portion of time.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   This will be like one 19th of my life so far.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.880]   So I understand when it seems like such a big part of your life, you don't want to waste
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.200]   it.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.880]   But from another perspective, I'm looking at this from the other side of 40.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.480]   That year is actually a much smaller piece of your life when you're looking backwards
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.720]   from mid-age back to it.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.600]   So this idea that if I waste this, I'm wasting a big part of my life, you're not.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.160]   This is a relatively small part of your life during your earlier year.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.040]   So I just want to take the pressure off a little bit.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.080]   You can enjoy yourself.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:00.440]   You can embrace serendipity, discover yourself, but also just catch your breath, get a little
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.680]   bit older before you start the next part of your life.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.720]   And that you will do no matter what, so you're not going to waste this.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.960]   Don't worry so much about it.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.880]   Now getting a little bit more specific, to me, what's important during a gap year?
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.560]   I think it's about better understanding yourself and what's important to you and what you're
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.940]   looking for in life.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.680]   Now these answers are very contingent and they'll change.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.440]   What you come up with when you're 18 will be different than when you're 22, which will
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.120]   be different than when you're 25, different than when you're 35.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.200]   But you have to begin asking these questions.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.680]   Gap year is great for that because when you're in high school, especially in the American
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.360]   context, it's not a time for self-reflection.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   School is my job.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.560]   I don't have a ton of autonomy because I still live at home under the care of my parents
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.520]   and I'm just trying to do well and get into college.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:53.400]   So your gap year might be your first real exposure to, "I want to seek out information
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   and experiences.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.600]   I want to process them and use them to better understand who I am and what it is I want
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   to do in the world."
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.520]   That's really what's important about the gap year.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:08.680]   Getting to novel places in this context are important largely because it helps you have
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.480]   more fresh insight.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.800]   You're out of normal routines and rhythms so that you're more likely to take the whatever
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.920]   Hemingway you're reading, John Williams you're reading, and see it fresh because you're in
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.280]   a completely new context and your brain is not in some sort of just standard pattern.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.880]   But what matters to me is the information you encounter during your gap year.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.480]   Trying to understand who you are, how the world works, and what you want to do in it.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.480]   That's what you want to come away with.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.080]   So you want journals with you, you want to take notes, you want to refine these notes,
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.920]   you want to have a lot of time alone with your own thoughts to make sense of this information.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:48.360]   Wherever you go, walk a lot, do not have your earbuds in all the time, maybe don't use social
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.600]   media for this year.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.040]   So you really want your mind to be kind of starved of inputs except for what's going
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.040]   on around it and inside your own head.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.920]   It's a time of process, process, process, process so that when you go to college the
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.360]   next year, I kind of have a sense of identity, I kind of have a sense of what I'm about,
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.400]   what's important, what's not.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.600]   So what am I doing here at college to get towards those things or to make sure my life
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.640]   at college reflects those things?
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.240]   That's what you want out of your gap year.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.800]   So it's really going to be about taking in information experiences and thinking about
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.860]   them and processing and taking notes.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.400]   You should go through a bunch of notebooks on your gap year and they're going to be embarrassing
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.480]   because they need to be because you're trying to work through these sort of deep thoughts
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.160]   and so maybe you want to hide them when you're done, but you should be writing and thinking
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   all the time.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.920]   So a gap year to me is about cognition much more than it is about location or specific
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.520]   places you are.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:45.000]   It's cognition that matters, having time for self-reflection, learning what the interior
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   cognitive contemplative life actually feels like, jump-starting that early in your adulthood
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.640]   so you can draw from that deposit throughout the years that follow.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.400]   It'll be fun.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.840]   Gap years weren't as big when we were young, were they?
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   Did you take a gap year?
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.920]   No, I did not.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:08.720]   I got accepted to Middlebury, but it wasn't until the February or the second semester,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.480]   but I didn't want to do that because I would have had to stick around for a semester at
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.360]   home and I wanted to play lacrosse and I felt like I'm going to be at a disadvantage when
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   I get there in the spring.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.360]   If you missed the fall.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.360]   Interesting.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   That was the only thing that was somewhat similar.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   Interesting.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.360]   So we might've been nearby if you had actually taken that because Dartmouth is not far.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.360]   That's a good point.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   It's not far from Middlebury, though.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.360]   I didn't play lacrosse.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   I was the same way.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.680]   I was like, I wanted to get out of that house.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.920]   I mean, my house was great, but I just was, I wanted to be on my own.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.360]   Like I was so like, I am ready to be on my own.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.520]   And then when I got to college, like pretty soon I was like, okay, I'm ready to be done
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   with college.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.080]   You know, I was just prematurely like a 37 year old.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.680]   My parents also owned a store, so I would have to work the whole fall and I wasn't really
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.080]   appealed to that.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   I know.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   I worked a lot.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   I had a lot of money.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   I was doing computer programming.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.320]   Like I worked a lot, you know, and yeah, I was excited to, and I went to a school in
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.080]   the quarter system, which means you don't start to like pretty late in September.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.680]   So even that, I was like, I'm the only one here.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.920]   Everyone had gotten to college and were like telling me these stories and yeah, so I was
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.480]   a gap year would have been okay.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.120]   I just wanted to like be an adult.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   So I don't think I even wanted a gap year.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120]   All right.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.080]   Do we have, oh, we have a call.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.080]   Yep.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.920]   And the call it looks like is going to be our slow productivity corner question of the
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   day.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   Yep.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   Our slow productivity corner.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.640]   If you don't know is we try to have at least one question per day that per episode that
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.040]   relates to my new book, slow productivity, which I highly recommend if you like the show,
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.640]   you need to read this book because it's sort of the source guide to everything we say about
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.540]   digital knowledge work.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.800]   But so it's our slow productivity corners, questions, a call.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.600]   Let's get some theme music.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:04.440]   Hi, Carol.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   My name is David.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.720]   I work in marketing and I'm calling from Perth, Australia.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:15.240]   I'm listening to your book, slow productivity, and I was struck by how some of the examples
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   you give like Robert McPhee and Anthony Zyka, and also the slow food movement reminded me
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:30.960]   of some interviews I read recently with a Korean born philosopher, Byung-Chul Han.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:37.200]   Now Han came to prominence with a 2015 book, the burnout society, and it's, it's really
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:43.000]   struck me that you want to hear kind of describing similar things about the present moment.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.800]   I'm new to your podcast and your work, and I wondered if you'd covered anything about
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   Han.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:53.480]   The connection just, it seemed to me to be obvious and kind of important.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:58.720]   So yeah, just a small niggling question.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   Cheers.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   All right.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.080]   Well, thanks for the question, Mark.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:08.240]   No, I did not know about Byung-Chul Han until recently.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:14.320]   A couple people actually, after slow productivity came out, sent me a pointer to his book, the
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.400]   burnout society, which I haven't read yet, but I want to.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   I've loaded it here.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.180]   So I loaded it up here on the screen.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.400]   I looked it up after your call.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.600]   So, so here's the book and let's read a little bit more about it because this is interesting
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   to me.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.840]   It's called the burnout society.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.560]   Here's the, let's read about the author first, Byung-Chul Han.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:39.160]   Berlin born German philosopher Byung-Chul Han teaches philosophy and cultural studies
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.000]   at Berlin's university of the arts.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.600]   In the past few years, his provocative essays have been translated into numerous languages
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.160]   and he has become one of the most widely read philosophers in Europe and beyond.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.920]   His work is presented here in English for the first time.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.760]   So this book is categorized, Stanford university press published this book.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:05.480]   So it's a, it's a academic press book, not a pure trade book.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:10.680]   It's categorization is philosophy, social theory, philosophy, post-structuralism and
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.320]   phenomenology sociology and culture.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.600]   So this is more of a sort of academic book.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.680]   So it sounds like what's going on here is Byung-Chul Han is, has a really big following,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.200]   especially in Europe.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.560]   And it's a little bit more recently that he's coming in translation over to the sort of
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.760]   the English speaking market.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.520]   So he probably, his ideas have probably, I'm going to guess are big in certain parts of
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.560]   the world and are just probably expanding their footprint here in the U S which might
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.800]   be why I hadn't heard about him before.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.000]   Let's read a little bit about the book itself.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.320]   This is from the description on the publisher's website.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.800]   I'm going to read just a few quotes here.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.880]   Our competitive service oriented societies are taking a toll on the late modern individual
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:58.000]   rather than improving life, multitasking, user-friendly technology, and the culture
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.360]   of convenience are producing disorders that range from depression to attention deficit
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.680]   disorder to borderline personality disorder.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:12.880]   Byung-Chul Han interprets the spreading malaise as an inability to manage negative experiences
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:19.440]   in an age characterized by excessive positivity and the universal availability of people and
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.640]   goods.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.760]   He looks, I'm now I'm going to paraphrase a few things.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.040]   He looks at stress and exhaustion as not just personal experiences, but social and historical
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.240]   phenomenon.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   He denounces a world in which against the grain response can lead to disempowerment.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.440]   He draws on literature philosophy and the social natural sciences to explore the stakes
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.720]   of sacrificing intermittent intellectual reflection for constant neural connection.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   All right.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.120]   So it sounds like there's sort of a lot going on in this book.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.960]   So there's an economic argument lurking in here that a consumer economy that's based
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:55.440]   on low friction and availability of information and goods and services changes our engagement
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.080]   with difficulty and hardship.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.960]   And so, you know, hey, I'm just used to everything being easy.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   So when things are hard, I have a hard time actually dealing with that.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.100]   So I think that's an interesting point.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.220]   There also seems to be something in here about lack of intellectual reflection.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:15.880]   So what he calls intermittent intellectual reflection, lack of time for that and instead
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.760]   having constant neural connection through technology is also having some sort of negative
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.520]   impact.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:28.400]   So these are obviously ideas that are congruent with the things I talk about, especially that
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:32.400]   last one, intermittent intellectual reflection.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.000]   This comes back to, I think, digital minimalism, where I talk about solitude deprivation, like
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.920]   you need time alone with your own thoughts or there's negative consequences and technology
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.160]   makes it possible to avoid time alone with your thoughts.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.240]   So I think that's there.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:53.680]   Taking an economic lens, I think, to try to understand some of our psychological or philosophical
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.680]   ennui, I mean, that's something I do as well, though I think we focus on different ideas.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:07.080]   So for example, it sounds like he's focusing here on easy availability of goods and information
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.820]   as making us ill-suited for hardship.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:15.560]   Using slow productivity, by contrast, I talk about pseudo productivity as leading to a
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   real problem.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.600]   So this idea of redefining productive labor as visible activity is causing a lot of problems,
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:27.400]   both economically and personally and psychologically when it comes to the knowledge work.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.000]   So it's a similar lens, but it's looking at different aspects of it.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.680]   Multitasking, we both dislike that.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:39.160]   Anyway, so it sounds like, yes, Myungchul Han, like a lot of authors right now, we're
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.400]   tackling these problems we have in our sort of technological world.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   There's a lot of these.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.660]   We are not as happy as we used to be.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.660]   And there's problems.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.920]   And it sounds like he has some interesting angles, some interesting things I agree with,
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.880]   some interesting things that are different than what I talk about.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.040]   I talk about some things that are different.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.400]   There's a bunch of other books like this, but this one looks cool.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.220]   And I like that it's a little bit more academic.
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.640]   So I will check it out and then I will report back about what I learned.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   All right.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.520]   So there we have our Slow Productivity Corner question of the day.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:19.880]   I also want to do a case study.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:25.120]   This is where I read an account sent in from one of our listeners about how they put the
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:30.080]   ideas we talked about on the show into practice in their actual life.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.760]   Today's case study comes from Ashley.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:39.080]   Ashley says, "I was listening to your episode on the Deep Life Stack 2.0, and you mentioned
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.080]   putting your phone on the charger right when you get home from work.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.440]   This is something I have been wanting to do for a long time, but for a lot of dumb reasons
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.640]   have never actually committed to it.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.800]   I finally committed and put my phone in our council table drawer so it will be out of
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.400]   sight when I am home with my kids.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.720]   Yesterday was my first day doing that, and I was doing well until I put my baby down
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.000]   for her nap.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.960]   My 4-year-old is still awake at this time, so usually I will put a show on for him, but
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:11.160]   I am too tired to do anything productive because the baby still isn't sleeping through the
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.160]   night.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.560]   So I will watch YouTube videos or listen to a podcast and generally just waste this time.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:21.600]   I was debating getting my phone out or maybe watching a movie with my son, but didn't want
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:27.960]   to go against the spirit of the rule around putting my phone away.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.120]   As I am deliberating this choice, my son comes up to me and tells me something that has been
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.960]   going on at school.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.320]   Normal kid drama, but something that has been really bothering him and that he has been
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   struggling with.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.760]   I am convinced he wouldn't have told me this had I put on a show for him.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:46.600]   It was only because he had the space to sit and think and I was available and distraction
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:51.240]   free that he thought to talk to me about it, and it was a really important conversation
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.240]   for us to have.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:57.260]   I am grateful for the reminder to focus on my relationships and to remove the distractions
[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.100]   that are getting in the way of me connecting with my kids.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.920]   I still wasn't productive during that time, but I had probably the most important conversation
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.640]   I have ever had with my son up until this point.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   So thank you.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.040]   I think that's a great case study.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:16.120]   So she's talking about the, Ashley's talking about the phone foyer method where when you're
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:21.180]   at home, you don't keep your phone as a constant companion, but instead something you can go
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.840]   to look stuff up or use if you need it for a very specific purpose, like I can put on
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.880]   a podcast to listen to or take a phone call, et cetera, but not something you pull out
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.280]   at the slightest hint of boredom.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:37.240]   Ashley is emphasizing one of the advantages of this method when you have kids is that
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:43.080]   the device really can be a boundary that goes up between you and your kids, mom, dad, they're
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.540]   looking at their phone.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.880]   They're not engaged with me or my world.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.100]   I guess I'll go do my own thing.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.020]   It's a boundary that does sit between us and our kids.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.000]   It's a boundary that does eliminate those sort of boring stretches where sometimes something
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.480]   really interesting comes out of it, where the kid just wants to start.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.540]   My sons will do this all the time, just start downloading something they're thinking about.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.120]   And this leads to something else.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.560]   And then you, and soon you're like learning something important or you go and we're going
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   to play a game.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.560]   We're going to go throw the ball around and interesting stuff comes out of it.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:17.360]   A lot of good comes out of just sort of informal structuring of time with people in your family.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.040]   And then the phone can sort of get in the way of that, especially if the kids themselves
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.240]   have phones too.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.120]   And now you've essentially dissolved any of these sort of strong in the house type of
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.120]   social connections.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.060]   There really is a cost to that.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.400]   So I do appreciate that.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.440]   And one thing I want to clarify, Ashley, Sue, well, two things, one, as you know, because
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:41.000]   you have other kids, I have full empathy about the kid not sleeping through the night phase.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.240]   And just a reminder that goes away because that's a terrible phase.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.400]   I mean, it's a good phase because it's a phase where like your baby's really young, but man,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   that's also a hard phase.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.280]   So that does, that does get better.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.160]   I always, I always say that when a parent writes it, that the sleep does get better.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.360]   But two, you said, I still wasn't productive during that time.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.800]   Well, there's no reason to be productive during that time, right?
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.960]   So it's not so much about productivity when we say, I don't want to always be distracted
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.400]   about my phone at home.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.320]   It's not because if I'm distracted by my phone, I can't be producing more widgets.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.680]   I can't be producing something useful.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.160]   Now the issue with the phone distracting you is that it keeps you away from things that
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160]   are even more meaningful.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.200]   It's not a lack of productivity we're fighting here.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.920]   It's a reduction of meaning.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.640]   It's a reduction of more intentional activities.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:35.520]   There's nothing productive about using like the, we have this little loom that like my
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   five-year-old likes.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.360]   You kind of make, you kind of knit things on it.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:42.120]   There's nothing productive about that, but it's like a meaningful or intentional activity
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.560]   that the phone could get in the way of.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.120]   So yeah, we definitely don't want to think about our at-home behaviors through the perspective
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.720]   of productive or nonproductive, but meaningful and intentional versus arbitrary or out of
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   our control.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.160]   So that's a great case study of the phone foyer method in action.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160]   And thank you for sending that in.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.160]   All right.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.600]   So we have a cool final segment coming up where I have some entertaining news about
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.080]   slowness from around the world, but first let's hear from another sponsor.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:15.240]   So I want to talk about Mint Mobile, you know, it's spring cleaning season right now.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:21.640]   And one of the takeaways we often have after we do a spring cleaning is we wonder how we
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.560]   ever live like the cluttered life we were living before we did the cleaning.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.280]   Once we see what it could be like when it's clean, well, it's kind of like when you find
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.120]   out that you've been paying a fortune for wireless, when Mint Mobile has phone plans
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.520]   for $15 a month, when you purchase a three-month plan.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.960]   So it makes you say, when you discover that, how was I paying so much money for phone service
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.580]   before?
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.340]   Just like when you clean your house, how was I living in such a dirty house before?
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:49.800]   That's how it feels when you find these affordable Mint Mobile plans.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:55.080]   It's time to switch to Mint Mobile and get unlimited talk, text, and data for just $15
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.520]   a month.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.380]   We're actually just setting up a new Mint Mobile plan now because we want, you know,
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.360]   we have this flip phone I've showed you.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.040]   We're setting up a plan for that flip phone.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.400]   It used to be in the studio, but we brought it home.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   So that when my 11-year-old is home by himself, that he has a way, or he gets home from school
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.940]   like on his own before we get there, he has a way he could call or text us without having
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.400]   access to the internet.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.800]   So like, yeah, it's only $15 a month.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.740]   We can put like a really nice plan on this simple phone.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.960]   So I love Mint Mobile.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.640]   It's just a way to get premium wireless plans without having to pay the big bucks.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.880]   They all come with high-speed data.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.680]   They all come with unlimited talk and text.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.400]   It's all delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.720]   We'll have connectivity wherever.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.160]   So you can ditch overpriced wireless with Mint Mobile's limited time deal and get three
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.720]   months of premium wireless service for just $15 a month.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.160]   To get this new customer offer and your new three-month unlimited wireless plan for just
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:57.560]   $15 a month, you have to go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.960]   That's Mint Mobile, M-I-N-T, mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:12.560]   Get your wireless bill to $15 a month at mintmobile.com/deep, $45 upfront payment required, which is equivalent
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   to $15 a month.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.480]   New customers on first three-month plan only speed slower once you get above 40 gigabytes
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.680]   on the unlimited plan.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.680]   All right.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:27.640]   I also want to talk about our friends at Maui Nui Venison, a mission-based company bringing
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:32.560]   the healthiest red meat on the planet directly to your door.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.000]   I love the story about Maui Nui.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Here's what's going on.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.280]   On the island of Maui, there is an invasive deer species, the Axis deer, that's eating
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   all the vegetation.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.120]   It's causing all these ecological problems.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   So they have to call the Axis deer herd to sort of prevent these ecological problems.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:54.600]   At Maui Nui, what they figured out was, wait a second, the meat in these deer is incredibly
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.960]   nutritious because they're eating a Hawaiian salad bar all day.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:03.640]   So instead of just destroying these deer to bring the populations in check, why don't
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:08.680]   we harvest this meat to produce very healthy, very healthy red meat?
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.560]   And that's what Maui Venison does.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.520]   It's a delicious and tender protein.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:19.720]   The sticks, the beef jerky, the venison jerky sticks, whatever you call those, are fantastic.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.880]   High protein, very low fat.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.480]   We've grilled up the steaks.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.520]   The venison steaks are fantastic.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.960]   My kids love them even.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:33.080]   So you're getting this really high quality, highly nutritious meat that's very sustainably
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.080]   harvested.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.360]   This is, we have to call these herds anyways.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.840]   Why not not waste this meat?
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.640]   So I highly recommend trying their venison jerky sticks or their steaks.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.000]   They have bone broth.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.720]   The fresh cuts are fantastic as well.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.220]   I love Maui Nui venison products in general.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:07:00.060]   You can get 20% off your first order if you go to mauinuivenison.com/deepquestions.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.060]   One word.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:11.240]   So that's Maui, M-A-U-I, Nui, N-U-I, venison.com, mauinuivenison.com/deepquestions to get 20%
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   off your first order.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.080]   All right, Jesse, let's go on to our final segment.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.900]   And I'm calling this final segment Slow News, three different things from around the world
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.920]   that involve the notion of slow in an interesting way.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.360]   So this is sort of a tribute to my book, Slow Productivity, which again, if you like the
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.680]   show, you need the book because it's sort of the source code to my thoughts about how
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.040]   to manage digital area knowledge works.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.840]   You can find out about the book at calnewport.com/slow.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.320]   All right.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.760]   So I have three things I want to show you.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:49.040]   The first thing comes from Switzerland, I have it on the screen here for those who are
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.860]   watching instead of just listening.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:59.160]   This is the slow watch that moves at half the speed of a normal watch.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.840]   So let me show you a picture of these watches.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:07.080]   So as you can see, Jesse, what's missing on these watches, and I'll zoom in, what's missing
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.840]   on these watches is a minute's hand or a second hand.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:19.320]   It has 24 hours and one hand that just moves slowly through all the hours of the day.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.480]   So that is the slow watch.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.960]   These are 300 bucks if you're wondering.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.000]   Let's read about it here.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.320]   They have some text about this.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.720]   So what's the idea?
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.800]   So slow they can't even get their website to work.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.320]   Here we go.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.280]   It is ironic the website was slow when I was working with it earlier.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.840]   All right, so here's their explanation of this concept.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.440]   All right, a 24 hour one hand watch allows you to see the entire day in one view and
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.880]   experience time in natural way.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.960]   This fundamentally changes the way you look at your watch and it will give you a much
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.200]   better consciousness about the progression of your day.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.600]   This way of showing the time is inspired by the original clocks that were based on the
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.120]   sun clock.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.000]   Those early clocks indeed had only one hand that displayed all 24 hours.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.560]   You can still see them on some old church towers.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.760]   Only when people's lives became busier and busier did they feel the need to create this
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:17.560]   unnatural split of the day into two 12 hour halves and break each hour down into 60 minutes.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.680]   That's when we started to chase the minutes and get stressed by time.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.880]   So let's turn back time and be slow again.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.720]   Time and timekeeping as a technology and how it impacts our understanding of the world
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.200]   is a well-worn topic in technology criticism.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.760]   If you go back to like Lewis Mumford's book, Technics in Civilization, he sort of opens
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:43.960]   that book talking about the monastic orders inventing sort of usable clocks so that they
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:50.760]   could time their prayers and talks about how this changed our conception of the world.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.620]   That time was broken into discrete evenly spaced units and so just inventing this technology
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.640]   changed our understanding of the world.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.000]   My understanding about minutes and seconds was the railroads made this useful.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.480]   So like for large scale international railroad networks to make sense, we needed time at
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.040]   just finer granularities because we actually had to know when a train arrived so that you
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.320]   could get from that train to another train and that completely changed the way we understood
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320]   time as well.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.600]   There's a lot of cool discussions.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.760]   Oliver Berkman has a good discussion about this in 4000 Weeks.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.840]   Anyways, it comes up a lot.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.440]   It's a cool topic.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.520]   All right.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.040]   Next example from slow news.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.400]   I'm going to read something here.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.440]   It looks like the slow watch is still on the screen, Jesse.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.440]   I don't know if that's...
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   There we go.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   All right.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.340]   Let me read this letter from a listener.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:42.360]   I really love slow productivity.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.760]   It's a fun read.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.640]   So much of it really resonated for me as an author who has embraced the slowness of a
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.840]   creative life, especially one away from social media.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.920]   I know that I write better books when I take my time with the stories.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.240]   My next book is perhaps an interesting slow productivity case study.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.960]   I wrote the first draft in 2012 and it got a book deal in 2014.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.740]   Then because of getting pushed by other books I had coming out first and then my editor
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:12.360]   moving to a different publishing house, the book sat for years.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.560]   In the meantime, I kept writing other things and would occasionally take another stab at
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.000]   editing the book.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.520]   I wasn't happy with the ending.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.940]   About eight years after I wrote the initial draft, I realized I had the skills to completely
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.960]   rewrite the book and make it better.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.580]   Almost a year after that, the ending finally worked itself out.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:28.680]   This is a picture book.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:33.960]   It's not very long, and yet it still took over 10 years to get right.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.760]   All right, and it turns out this picture book, which I'll load up on the screen here, Help
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.600]   Wanted, One Rooster, here's the picture here, comes out in June.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.440]   So 10 years later, this book is coming out.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.500]   I thought that was a cool case study, this idea of spending 10 years to get a book right.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.500]   Not a long book, right?
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.760]   But just let me come back to it.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.060]   It's not quite right.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:01.760]   This really resonates with the third principle of slow productivity, obsess over craft.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   You want something to be good.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.200]   You want to get better at what you do.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.000]   Completely changes your relationship to work.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.400]   Something like this, like spending a decade working in the background on a book, makes
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.320]   a lot of sense in the slow productivity mindset in a way that it might not otherwise in a
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.480]   pseudo productivity mindset, which is focused instead just on activity.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.680]   So Julie, thanks for sending in that entertaining example and informative example of slowness
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   in action.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:35.080]   All right, so my final thing is, it's actually from England, and this is going to be something
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.580]   about me.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.520]   So a couple of people sent this to me.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:47.640]   I guess there's a satiric literary magazine in England called something, Private Eye,
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   I believe.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.960]   And they have a literary review section.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.360]   Anyways, they had a comic I put here on the screen.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.760]   This is from a literary magazine and it's a satirical comic called First Drafts.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.880]   All right, so here's the, I'll explain this cartoon.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.460]   I appreciate this cartoon.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.920]   For those who are listening at home, it's a three panel comic.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.000]   In the first panel, there's someone staring at a blank screen on the computer.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.260]   And the next panel, they press one button and the letter C goes up on the screen.
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:21.480]   And in the third panel, they're leaning back, satisfied, drinking a cup of coffee.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.040]   The caption for this comic is Slow Productivity by Cal Newport.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040]   So there we go.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.040]   I think it's a satire of slow productivity.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.600]   You write one letter after great contemplation and consider you've done your work.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.780]   I'm really just happy, Jesse, that whoever drew this comic thought that me in that book
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.680]   is well enough known that people would understand the comic.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:50.000]   That's the good news, I think, that there's an assumption that enough people in the UK
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.720]   have seen this that they'll actually understand the comic.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.760]   Well, you had that big profile in the Financial Times like last year.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.760]   That's right.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   And I was on the bestseller list over there.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   So it's me.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   And I'm going over there.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.680]   I've got mid-May, I am going to London and doing a few days of publicity activities over
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   there.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   I wish I had a, this would be nice.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.400]   We should get a copy of this comic.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.040]   Would be nice to frame for the HQ.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.040]   Private Eye.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.040]   All right.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.800]   Maybe I'll have to grab a copy of that when I'm over there.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.880]   I don't know how often it comes out, but maybe I'll try to find a copy of that to bring back
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   from England.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   It'd be funny.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.360]   It's the first time I've been featured/satirized in a cartoon.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.480]   So good, I suppose.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480]   All right.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.480]   Well, anyways, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   Thank you for listening.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.640]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.840]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.480]   Hey, if you liked today's discussion of intentional information, I think you'll also like episode
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:50.240]   287, where I discussed how to take notes on the information you choose to take into your
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.240]   life.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   I think you'll like it.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240]   Check it out.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.520]   The system I use for keeping notes on information for all parts of my work and life.
