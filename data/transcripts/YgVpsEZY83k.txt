[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   As Pastor John Piper finishes up his travels through the Middle East during the month of November,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   we're going back and listening to a few Ask Pastor John recordings from years past.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And a few years back, he was asked this question,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   "What are some ways we can know Christianity is true?"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   You can come at the truth of Christianity through several angles of apologetics or of reasoning.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Let me mention a few and tell you the one that is most existentially real for me.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   One would be historical.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I think arguments can be mounted that are solid and compelling,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   first for the existence of Jesus, and then for the death of Jesus,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and for the resurrection of Jesus to give an account for why the Apostles were the way they were after his death.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So that the arguments that Pondenberg has developed or evangelicals have developed
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   for the resurrection of the dead, "who moved the stone" type arguments, that's the name of the book,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   are strong and have helped many people get over the barrier.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Because if Jesus has been raised from the dead, never to die again, and ascend into heaven,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   then we should take very seriously and credit what he said about himself.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So that's one line of evidence.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   A second line of evidence would be what would be called presuppositional,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   that without God as an assumption, without the Bible as an assumption,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   all of our reasoning processes or all of our perceiving processes are not possible.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   In other words, every time we start thinking and every time we start perceiving,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   something is happening in our heads which assumes something.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And if you're going to have any kind of credible conversation about what you're thinking or about what you're seeing,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   then you are assuming certain laws of logic, certain laws of causality, certain laws of existence,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   which can't have any bearing or absolute significance unless they're rooted in God.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So everybody's talking nonsense, but hardly anybody will say we're all just animals talking nonsense.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Even those who are total secular naturalistic evolutionists don't like to be treated like animals.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   When a dog barks, I don't assume he's writing poetry.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But when a man puts poetry down, I assume he wants me to take him seriously as a human being,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   because it has serious meaning there and he doesn't like it if I say, "Oh, that's just chicken scratch."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So he's assuming something unbelievably profound about the significance and the basis of what he's doing,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   which he can't unless there's this Christian construction of God.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So that's the presuppositional angle.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Here's the third one and the last one that is most significant to me.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   How do you, when you want to decide if a testimony, a witness that somebody has is true?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You weren't there, there were no videos, there was no recording,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and you have to decide whether what he's saying happened, happened.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So that's, when I read this book, that's the way I feel I am.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'm reading Paul say, 13 letters of the Apostle Paul,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and he's telling me he saw the Lord Jesus.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   He's telling me that he was knocked off his donkey on the Damascus Road,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   saw the Lord Jesus, was commissioned by the Lord Jesus, and now is inspired by the Lord Jesus.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And then he interprets all of that in terms of the gospel.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Now, I've got to reckon with, Paul, are you a lunatic?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Are you a liar? Or are you telling the truth?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   That's usually used with Jesus, you know, lunatic, liar, or Lord.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I think it's a good argument, and I use it for the writers of the New Testament,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   not just for Jesus, because that's what I, I know that I've got Paul right here in my hand.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I've got Paul right here in my hand, and I want to know, are you crazy?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So when I'm reading the Bible, whether it's the Gospel of John or whether it's Romans,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I'm asking the question, how can I credit what's here, both the testimony of the man and the portrait of Jesus?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And I think there is a light that stands forth from the text of the truthfulness of Jesus that is self-authenticating.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And there is a kind of character for the writers that stands forth that is authenticating of their solidity,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   their truthfulness, that they're not lunatics and they're not liars.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And I would find it, if somebody said to me today, "Okay, just give me in 30 seconds why you're a Christian,"
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I would say, number one, the portrait that I see of Jesus Christ in the Gospels is self-authenticating to me.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I cannot meet this man and have him speak like nobody else spoke and not believe him.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   He wins my trust.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And then if they say, "Ah, but how do you know that that person is not being created by somebody else?"
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And I would say, "Well, then the person that's creating him is just as phenomenal, and they win my trust.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And if they win my trust, then they're not lying to me."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   The Apostle Paul is not a lunatic.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I cannot read the 13 letters of the Apostle Paul and think he's crazy or think he's a liar.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   So those two things, the self-authenticating portrait of Jesus Christ that I find in Scripture
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and the character-endorsing way that the Apostles write their books and reveal their own trustworthiness.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That was Pastor John Piper. Thank you for listening to this podcast.
