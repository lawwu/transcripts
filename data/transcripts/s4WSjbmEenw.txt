[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   So I just turned 40 and I realized there weren't a lot of things I wanted for my birthday because
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.320]   I have spent so much time finding and researching the best products and services, but it got me
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.280]   thinking that since so many of you have asked me about what I use in different areas of my life,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.800]   it would make the perfect topic for an episode to talk about all of those things, from tech to
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.240]   finance, health to our home, my business. I'm going to share my top picks across over a dozen
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.720]   different categories of products, apps, services, and more. You can find links to everything I'm
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.200]   discussing in the description, which I also will put up at allthehacks.com/stuff. And just to be
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.920]   clear, none of the brands I'm talking about here have paid to be included in this episode. That
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.440]   said, where I could find an affiliate link, I did add it to the description and to the website,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.760]   so if you want to support me and the show, I'd love and appreciate if you want to use the links
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.800]   that you can find there, which I also included any discount codes I could find for all these
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.080]   products as well. Quick reminder, before we jump in, we do have timestamps in the show notes,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.320]   so you can jump around. A couple of listeners recently told me that they don't work on every
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.680]   platform, and my hosting provider doesn't make it possible to work on certain platforms like
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.160]   Overcast and Apple. I am working on that, but at least we have the time codes in there, so if you
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   want to jump ahead, you can find them. On some platforms, you can just click them and it'll work,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   so I would love that to work every platform, so hopefully that will be done soon. All right,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.320]   to kick us off, I thought I'd talk a little bit about technology. So first off, iPhone 15 Pro is
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.320]   my core device. I send so many texts from my Mac. I could never really have an Android as much as I
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.680]   tried a few times. Honestly, because of that iMessage integration is probably the most important,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.720]   but also now that I've just gotten so tied into it and then watching all these PCs crash during
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.040]   this CrowdStrike rollout, haven't had any issues on a Mac. Love my Macs. Love my iPhone. Probably
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   won't change that in the future. I really love AirPods. I actually lost my third-gen AirPods,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.480]   and I'm still happy enough with the second-gen ones, so I've just kept them. I did try the
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.280]   Pro AirPods, and the AirPod Maxes didn't like those, returned them. On the computer side,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.520]   I use an M2 MacBook Air. Really love it. Got a great sticker on here. My other vehicle is a 401k.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.000]   Love that. Thanks to the Playing With Fire team who printed those stickers. I've had them on my
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.480]   computer ever since. Then let's see. I use a Magic Keyboard and a Magic Trackpad. I don't use an
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.920]   actual mouse. I really want the new Magic Keyboard that has the built-in Touch ID, but I don't have
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.320]   that right now. I kind of wish I did, but it's one of those things that doesn't feel absolutely
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.640]   necessary. A couple other tech products I love that I have here. I've got this Anker Prime
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   charger, but I just love their products when it comes to charging your phone, battery backups,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.160]   everything like that. I have one of the, I guess this is the GAN Prime. I've just had great success
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.400]   using them. Really big fan of those. I also have this great, Mercury sent me this Moft iPhone
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.000]   wallet that holds three cards and a couple dollar bills. It's a MagSafe charger. I really love this
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.840]   because you can fold it up and you can rest your phone on it sideways and up and down. Really love
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   this little tiny thing. On my desk, you'd see three other products. You'd see some Bose desktop
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.720]   speakers. Honestly, I just like having good quality sound and my primary computer, I didn't even
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.480]   mention this, is actually a Mac Mini. And so because it doesn't have audio built into it,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.600]   I need some speakers. But the other two things, I have another Anker charger. I believe that this
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.240]   Anker charger is called the Anker Wireless Power Wave. It's a magnetic charger. Also charges AirPods
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.440]   if you had a MagSafe case, which I don't right now. And then I have an Elgato Stream Deck.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.680]   Now this is primarily a product made for gamers, but I absolutely love it. It's this tiny little
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.600]   device that sits on your desk and has 15 little LED buttons that you can control what they do.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   And so for me, if I look at it right now, I do a lot of recording and so I have it able to switch
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.520]   cameras. So if you were to watch a video of this, you'd actually see that we have three cameras,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.320]   one looking at me, one looking at the desk from one side and one looking at desk from the other
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.760]   side. And so I can control that. I can control the microphone. I can mute myself. I can switch
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.200]   between headphones and speakers. I can pause Spotify. I can mute my video or audio in a Zoom
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.280]   call. So I have that over here too. I control the lights in this room if I wanted to. I've put all
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.760]   of these things in here. I have a couple of websites that'll quick pop open. One button just
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.920]   tabs to a couple of pages. I probably use it 50 times a day. I would highly recommend people that
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.320]   are kind of productivity efficiency people take a look at it. There's a bunch of different versions
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.720]   of Stream Decks, but I think I have the MK2 in black and I really, really like it. As for what
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.160]   is on my desk, I'm working at an Uplift desk. I got one of these back when we had a startup and
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.760]   it's just been a really solid desk for rising up and down. I like standing sometimes, sitting
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.120]   sometimes, well-built, no issues there. I'm sitting at a steel case gesture chair, which I tried a
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.160]   bunch of chairs a long time ago. And then when we were running a startup, we found this guy that I
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.200]   guess sells chairs, like premium desk chairs for offices. But we never asked where he got them. He
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.600]   rolled up in like a beat up minivan and had these like $1,500 chairs for $500. And so we figured
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.240]   that we were hiring a bunch of people to sit at a desk all day, every day during the week that we
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.800]   should invest in quality chairs. And so when the company wound down, I took one of these steel case
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   gesture chairs home and I really like it. A few other AV things here that I'll get back to
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.480]   when I start talking about the podcast setup and all of that. I'm also only really trying to
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.000]   highlight my favorite things. So yeah, I might have a surge protector on this desk, but if it's
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.920]   not something I really, really like, I'm not really going to highlight it because that doesn't
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.360]   make sense. You might have a better recommendation than me. But when it comes to using the computer,
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.440]   I want to talk about some software on here that I really, really like. So first off,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.320]   I've gotten a couple emails recently about what storage backups I use. I don't think I have a
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   perfect solution for the cloud. So for a while I use Dropbox. And then when I started recording
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.280]   videos for the podcast, we ran out of space. So I switched to Google drive because I got more space
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.440]   with our Google workspace account for my phone. I back everything up on iCloud. I use photos and
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.720]   iCloud backup for messages and all that. So that's how I back up there. But the recent purchase that
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   I made that I am really, really happy with is the Synology 923 plus. It's a network attached
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.400]   storage device. So it's called a disk station, DS923 plus. And imagine a little device that just
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.480]   has a bunch of hard drives in it that you can plug into your network at home. You can attach it to
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   your computer as like a network storage drive. But the thing I love about it is that it syncs
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.760]   everything instantly with the cloud. So for example, if I'm finishing recording this episode
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.480]   and I take the audio and video files and I put them on that network drive, it's really fast
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.440]   because it's local and it's connected via ethernet. But then that device backs everything up on it in
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   a few folders with the cloud. So I also have three or four 22 terabyte drives in there in what's
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.560]   called a RAID array. So it doesn't actually use up all of the drives. I think I have three 22
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.480]   terabyte drives, but I only get 40 terabytes and it backs everything up such that if one of those
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.080]   drives failed, I didn't lose anything. So a lot of that archival footage from old VHS tapes,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.280]   old photos that are not in my current library, I put all of them there. Some of those folders
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.560]   get auto backed up to Google drive. Some of them don't, but that is how I back up all of my
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.760]   important things on the computer. I'll try to get through this fast because I know not everyone is
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.360]   a Mac user, but I have an app I use every day, all the time called Alfred, which replaces the
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.800]   spotlight search, just has a bit more functionality than superhuman for email. It's totally the
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.880]   fastest email I've been using it for a long time. Highly, highly recommend everyone check it out.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.960]   I think you could probably get back according to their website, four hours a week, maybe more.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.680]   It is so fast. Some of the new AI features they've added, letting you query your email and just,
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.920]   you know, auto write emails are so good. If someone said superhuman was going away,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.880]   it might be one of the few products that I'd be like, no, like what? No, I don't want you like
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.760]   some things I could find alternatives with. For example, I use a loom to record a ton of videos
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.640]   for work. I love loom. It's cross platform. Basically think of it as a really quick way
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.720]   to record your screen. So if you're trying to explain to someone how something works or how
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.600]   to do something or ask a question, I record a loom video. I send it to them. I use it a lot
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.000]   of times for async meetings. Someone says, Hey, I'd love if we could meet so you could review this
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.560]   project I'm working on. And then I'll just review the project, record myself for 10 minutes, send
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.920]   them the video. And now we've avoided a 30 minute meeting. I can record it whenever I want. I do
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.720]   that a lot. Uh, I love when people do that for me and we can kind of be more efficient. I recently
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.360]   found this app called code Piper, which basically, if you have an iPhone and you've noticed when you
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.520]   get those two factor authentication codes, it auto pastes them into the, whatever you're doing,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   whether it's, you're trying to fill it out on a website. It does that for the Mac. Also really
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   love the code Piper app. If you have an iPhone and you know, when you get one of those six digit
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.480]   two factor authentication codes, code Piper does what happens on the iPhone naturally on your
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.640]   computer. So if you get a text and you need to put it into the browser and you're using Chrome or
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.440]   any other browser, it solves that. Another app I couldn't really live without is called rectangle.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:42.080]   It's basically a way to move things and manipulate things on your screen. So I press command option,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.720]   right? And it jumps the window I'm looking at currently to the right side. And if I press it
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.360]   three times, it cycles between the right third, the right middle and the right two thirds. And
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.400]   so if I'm trying to quickly split my screen between two apps, I can do it in a couple seconds.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.880]   I love the rectangle app. It's absolutely free. They do have a pro version, but I don't even think
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.000]   I have the pro version. The free version is awesome as is really also love the paprika app.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   I've talked about this app a bunch of times. It is a recipe database, meal planning and grocery
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.840]   tracking. I know there are a lot of apps out there that do this, so I'm not going to knock whichever
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.000]   one you use, but I really, really love the paprika app. And you know, Amy and I are both logged in on
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.960]   both of our phones. We rate recipes. If we find recipes online, we save them. You could dump all
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.880]   the ingredients from the recipe into the grocery list. Even if we're both at the grocery store at
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.880]   the same time, we can be checking things off together. And then we can kind of meal plan out
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.920]   for the week. So really love this app. It's on all platforms, so anyone can use it. Also really love
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.160]   another all platform app called one password. You guys have probably heard me talk about it for
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.280]   years. I've probably been using it for kind of seems like almost a decade at this point. I've
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.040]   forced everyone in my family to switch over. It is my favorite password manager. They natively
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.840]   support a bunch of new stuff as it comes. They supported two factor codes as a replacement for
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.440]   Google Authenticator. They now support pass keys. Really solid product. I really don't think anyone
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   should have passwords that they have to remember other than their one password. There are other
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.600]   password managers. This is just the one I've been using forever, and I see no reason to switch.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.560]   Another app I couldn't live without is the arc browser. I've switched full time from all my
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.840]   devices, even my iPhone to using arcs browser. The ability to have your tab bar on the left
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.760]   and have tabs kind of in this both primary and ephemeral space is really incredible. I wish
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.920]   there was an easy way for me to explain how good it is just in audio form, but it's a free app. So
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.680]   go check it out. You can use it. I think they now have a windows version and a Mac versions,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.520]   really great browser. Also really love Nord VPN. You could basically choose almost any country in
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.960]   the world and really quickly connect to them. I don't necessarily think it's necessary with the
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.720]   advent of HTTPS. However, there are so many cases, and I'll give you a couple examples when having a
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.600]   VPN has been helpful. Number one, watching the Olympics. If you want to make sure that you get
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.520]   access to different versions of the Olympics, maybe you don't have a peacock subscription.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.360]   You could just VPN over to the UK and use the BBC one. You can VPN over to Australia and use
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.640]   their now nine, I think it is. So I've been able to do that to watch some of the Olympics. Sometimes
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.680]   if you are trying to be a little sneaky and maybe there's a product you use and they have a referral
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.480]   program. And if you refer someone, you get a bonus and you want to just refer another email address.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.720]   I tried that today and it didn't work because it said, Oh, you're in the same IP. It didn't say
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.960]   that. It just said you can't refer yourself, but jumped open a Nord switch to a VPN over in Texas
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.360]   and connected pretty quickly. And then boom, all of a sudden it's like, Oh, you are a new person.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.400]   Thank you. So love Nord VPN for anything, especially if you're traveling internationally
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.600]   and want to be able to access things in the U S um, you want to make sure your device seems like
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.120]   it's in the U S awesome product. Um, that's the main stuff. I'm going to talk briefly about Chrome
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.840]   extensions because yes, apps are great, but there are some Chrome extensions that are really,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.600]   really great. So one library extension, when you're browsing Amazon, it'll just show you
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.840]   all of the libraries that have that book in either checkout or ebook form.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.400]   Second is a app called points path. So when you're browsing Google flights, it actually
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   shows you all of the cost in points for the major U S airline. So like United American and Delta,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.560]   and it'll say, Hey, actually, you know, this flight's three 39, it's going to be 34,000
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.240]   points. You should use cash, but Hey, this flight's three 39, and it's only 14,000 points
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.600]   and $6 in taxes. Great deal. You should use your points. Love that because anytime you're shopping
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.800]   online, you could basically earn cash back. Sometimes it's like 15, 20%, sometimes it's 2%,
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.440]   but almost every time it's some percent that you wouldn't have got back otherwise.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.760]   And if you link your Amex account to Rakuten, instead of earning pennies, you can earn Amex
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.080]   points. So if you would have gotten a hundred dollars in cash back, it would have actually been
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.040]   about 10,000 Amex points, which I think Amex points end up being worth more than a penny.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:15.200]   So I think it's a great deal. Love the KIPA extension. Basically it's an Amazon price
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.240]   tracker. So if you're looking at a product on Amazon, you can go look at a historical graph
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.880]   of how much that product has cost. So I'm looking right now at that Anker magnetic charging stand
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.720]   I have on my desk. And you can see right now it's $39.99, but it was $32.99 for a few days
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.800]   in early July. My guess is it'll probably be $32.99 again. If that was something that you
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.120]   didn't really need urgently, it seems like it's gone on sale twice in the last couple months.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.520]   Also really like this don't F with paste browser extension. The F is short for the expletive.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.880]   I love it because what it does is every time you go to a website, it's not going to allow you to
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:01.600]   paste something in, which often happens on a bank website that says, what's your account and routing
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.520]   number? Oh, but you can't paste it in. And presumably it's because they don't want you to
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.640]   mess it up, but I'm actually usually copying it from the source. So I'm more likely to mess it up
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.320]   if I have to type it and don't F with paste goes in and allows you to paste when you otherwise
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.280]   wouldn't. If you have a Capital One card, the Eno browser extension is amazing because it lets you
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   create virtual cards for all of your cap one cards. So venture X, two X points everywhere.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.560]   One of my primary shopping cards online, if not my only shopping card online. And so I can still
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.920]   earn two X points, but I can create virtual cards either because I just don't want to give some
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.320]   e-commerce site, my regular credit card number. Maybe it's a weird kind of sketchy e-commerce site
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.720]   or if I'm signing up for a trial for something. And I want to make sure that if I forget to cancel,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.800]   I don't get charged. I can use my venture X card on a virtual card and set it to expire the next
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   day so that by 14 days, it won't work. Uh, also the card pointers browser extension. I'm going
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.840]   to talk in a little bit about, um, travel points and miles. I probably should have put points path
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.120]   there, but I'll bring up card pointers again on my iPhone. Love superhuman arc. A lot of the
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.760]   main stuff. One that I use a lot, which I'd be curious if someone has a better recommendation,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.160]   I'm all ears is the best parking app. If you're ever in a city and you need to find a parking
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.320]   space, it basically just gives you a map of the price of all the parking garages nearby
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   chat GPT. It's my shortcut button. So if I just press the button on my iPhone, it is chat GPT.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.520]   I use it all the time. I use it on web and on mobile. Uh, it's fantastic. Another one that
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.200]   I've recently really been loving is the Morty app. Um, I have a pulled up right now and it's
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.680]   basically a directory of escape rooms. And so only interesting if you love escape rooms, which
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.320]   I happen to really like, but you can open it up. You can sort by the community score and you can
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.880]   get access to all of these rooms. So if you're in San Francisco, according to this, the number one
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.800]   escape room in the whole area is Robo topia at I'm escape in Sunnyvale. I have not done that room.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.640]   I would love to, Oh, I filtered out a couple of the ones I've done that I thought were fantastic
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.800]   that I've already done, but the Edison escape room up at palace games. Excellent. I could go
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.840]   on about escape room. So I will not also another app I use a lot as infatuation. It's a kind of
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.200]   like a food site, like eater or Yelp, but I just really liked the editorial they put in there.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.840]   And then for listening to podcasts, it's funny. I used to use Spotify and then I had a couple
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.720]   private RSS feeds that I subscribed to through Patreon and Spotify didn't support them.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   So I tried Apple podcasts. I like listening to my podcast at like 2.1 X, which I know is pretty fast
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.560]   and Apple caps out at two. So recently I've been trying to overcast and I I'm not ready to commit
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.800]   that it's the best out there, but it's pretty close so far. I really like it. Um, that said,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:54.000]   I still pay for Spotify. So I'm going to move on from talking about apps and software and talk a
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.920]   little bit about subscriptions. So on the subscription front, uh, I pay for some and get a
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.600]   bunch for free also. So Amazon prime still happen to be on my parents subscription. Uh, I do pay for
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:12.720]   YouTube premium Spotify and masterclass all have really great content. Um, Apple TV plus love the
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.400]   content there. Get it for free with T-Mobile Netflix. Love the content. Also free with T-Mobile
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.680]   Disney plus kids love the content free with an Amex platinum digital entertainment credit,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.440]   uh, Paramount plus not even sure I watch it, but Amex platinum gives you free Walmart plus and
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.760]   Walmart plus gives you free Paramount plus. So I do have a subscription, uh, to Paramount plus,
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.440]   but I'm not even sure if I ever use it. A new subscription in my arsenal is a product called
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.720]   stable and it is a virtual mailbox. Now I'd say primary reason many people might want this is for
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.480]   their business. Instead of getting a bunch of mail sent to your home, instead of having your home
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.680]   address show up all over the internet, uh, because business addresses are made public switch to
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:04.160]   something like stable, send all your mail there. They'll scan it or ship it back out to you. So
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.560]   easy to manage. It's basically like the only business address you ever need. And the greatest
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.360]   thing is I also use it for a lot of personal stuff, but if you really just want to make sure
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.680]   you get a little bit more privacy on the personal side or the business side, or you just want the
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.640]   convenience of accessing mail, even when you're traveling, I used to use this service called
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.400]   I postal one, pretty much a disaster. I finally did tons of research cause I didn't want to mess
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.680]   this up again. And I switched to stable and it's been an incredible service. Speaking of getting
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.160]   your information off the internet, I will talk for a second about another service I love called
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.600]   delete me. Basically anytime you put your name, address, email, phone number, all that stuff,
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.920]   there are a ton of companies that resell all that data. And unfortunately, when they resell that
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.800]   data, it ends up on so many data broker websites. So I use delete me to get rid of it. I'm looking
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:00.080]   at one of my reports now and they've reviewed pretty regularly about 20,000 listings. And it's
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.200]   an ongoing service that every time I get a report, they've removed sometimes two or three things,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.120]   sometimes 40 things. I've now bought it for almost my entire family. So a really big fan there.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.600]   I also pay for premium Twitter now to remove all the ads. It's really my primary source of news.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.680]   I don't use the for you at all. I just follow all the news accounts that I would normally want to
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.720]   follow. And then I could just use it as a quick feed. Um, I follow a small enough number of
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.680]   people that it's not really messy and I'm never looking at the for you tab. So, um, that's not
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:38.400]   there. And I do pay for chat GPT also love chat GPT. Um, the new four is really good and I'm sure
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.960]   there are other models that are going to be faster and freer, but I think once you start using one,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.880]   it's hard to want to switch though. I really wish they would have just some easy way to search.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.320]   So that's mostly subscriptions. So let's talk a little bit about money. Um, when it comes to the
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.960]   best bank accounts, episode one 77, I already covered all of this. So I'll just refer people
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:03.680]   there, but wealth front Mercury fidelity kind of came up at the top for banking and brokerage. So
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.440]   that's that. Um, when it comes to software tools for your money, I want to talk about a few things.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.680]   First is a product called Kubera, which is in my opinion, one of the best ways to monitor your net
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.720]   worth. Think of it like if you built an app that was an amazing net worth tracking spreadsheet,
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.120]   it would automatically connect to all of your accounts. They use multiple providers. So things
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.840]   don't fail as much as they do other ways. I love it. If you're a member of all the hacks, what you
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.080]   can do at all the hacks.com/join, you get your first year of Kubera for $1. Um, it's a really
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.280]   great product when it comes to doing a little bit more modeling. Um, I really like projection lab.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.440]   You can basically build your own financial plan. They actually have a way to go simulate and play
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.160]   it and use it for free. So highly recommend that. I think we do have a discount, but you don't even
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.640]   need to pay to get started when it comes to tracking your spending. I use co-pilot it's
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.680]   only on iPhone and Mac, but they are building a web and an Android version. And I think it's one
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:06.640]   of the easiest ways to make sure you categorize and monitor all of your spending and use it to
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.200]   retroactively build a budget. But I did cover all the apps that I compared when I decided to use
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.000]   co-pilot in episode one 33 and talked a lot about how I manage that cashflow process. Um, when it
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.200]   comes to being charitable, I use Daffy. I interviewed Daffy's founder, Adam Nash in episode
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:30.080]   50. It is really the way that we give money. So we donate all the money to our donor advised fund.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.720]   And it's just a really centralized place that makes it super efficient for taxes. That's primarily
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.920]   how we do all of our charitable giving. And then when it comes to tax advantaged accounts,
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.520]   because we run our own company, we've moved all of our old 401ks into a solo 401k that we have at
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:54.560]   carry. Um, and so we, that we found to be the best way to manage our 401ks and, and our self-directed
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.720]   IRAs at carry, and then not really a app or a tool, but, uh, I've talked about guilt a lot.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.760]   There are CPA for how we manage everything personal taxes. And then when it comes to
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   business stuff, I'll get to that later when it's both finances and other stuff.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.960]   Also, when it comes to managing all of your financial information,
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.480]   I really like the trustworthy product. Basically think of it like your digital vault for everything.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:25.120]   They put all of your tax returns, IDs information. Think if something were going to happen to you
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.040]   and someone needed to just know where everything is, all your accounts, what are all the account
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.880]   numbers? What places are they at? Pictures of passports, insurance cards. I love it. Um,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.080]   they have a mobile app. So if you're at the doctor's office and you need a picture of your
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.960]   insurance card or something like that, it's, it's easy to access all of it.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.640]   So another recommendation there next, I want to talk about health fitness and all the different
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.040]   services there. Cause I spent a bunch of time thinking about this and some of them are gonna,
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.560]   I'm going to punt on for an episode I'm working on. And some of them I'm just going to share. So
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:03.440]   at home, got a Peloton really love it. I've had it for a long time, but I actually really want
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:11.760]   a tonal and I'm, I'm not yet convinced that I will use it enough, which is why I've held out.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.440]   But I feel like I've been trying to get back into the strength game, especially after doing a DEXA
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.880]   scan and realizing I could really increase my muscle mass. So tonal is something that if we
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.400]   had a wall, that was an obvious place for it. I might get, it's not cheap, but I really don't
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.040]   have the space for a whole regular setup. What I do have the space for are two products that
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:39.520]   I really like, which are the Bowflex select tech adjustable dumbbells. They're fantastic.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.320]   So if you want a really small space, but you want all different weights, really love that.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.200]   I also have an adjustable kettlebell, but it's about 10 years old and I'm pretty sure the model
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.000]   we have has been discontinued and improved. And it's not that great. It's a great product
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.920]   conceptually, but I wouldn't get that specific version. A couple other health and fitness
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.200]   products. I really love wearing my aura ring for fitness, sleep tracking. It's fantastic.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.560]   Even though I had a gen two, I actually just upgraded to the gen three. So really love that.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:17.600]   These headphones right here are the shocks open run pro. I love these headphones. When it comes
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.360]   to working out, I think they're fantastic. If you're going on a run, they're open ear. So if
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.600]   you I'm putting them on right now, so you don't have something in your ear. So if you're going
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.120]   on a run, you'd obviously hear all your surroundings. If you're going on a run with
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.640]   someone and you wanted to be able to talk to them super easy, the open run pro highly recommend
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.880]   these headphones, couple other kinds of health related products. When it comes to running,
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.960]   I love the Nike vapor five, three shoes. They're really expensive. I actually asked for them. I
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.800]   think it was Christmas or my birthday because I, my parents were asking what do you want? And I
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.480]   couldn't come up with anything. And I'd been eyeing these, but I just couldn't pull the trigger.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.920]   But they're nuts there. I don't even know how to explain it because I was pretty diligent at
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   recording all of my runs in the Peloton app. And I use these shoes and I'm not joking was like five
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.720]   to 7% faster wearing these shoes. Then I started doing all these research about how they almost
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.800]   got banned from the Olympics because they're just that amazing. And so if you're trying to shave
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.640]   off time running, they're fantastic. There are probably shoes that are equally as good. Um,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.040]   but for some reason now I'm like, gosh, if I wear another pair of shoes, I'm going to go up in time.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.680]   So I got to keep these shoes going. A few other things around the house. We do have a plunge
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.960]   cold plunge. I looked at a lot of cold plunge. I really liked the plunge ones. And then we recently
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.720]   added a sauna from Haven. They have not launched officially yet, but if you go to Haven sauna.com,
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.080]   you can put your name in the wait list. They build these really beautiful saunas at home,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.520]   and they've got some really cool stuff coming soon. A couple more health things. So for doctors,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.360]   we use one medical for the whole family. It's pretty convenient to be able to schedule
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.080]   appointments last minute, do virtual calls. There might be other things happening in this
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.400]   space soon. It feels really weird that Amazon, because they acquired them is now my doctor,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.920]   but all these concierge doctors I've been looking into doing research are, you know,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.720]   5,000 to $25,000 a year, which is just way out of our price range and budget.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.440]   I do spend $19, I think, a month for Peter Attia's premium podcast feed and access to his premium
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:33.360]   show notes. Really like the Attia podcast, The Drive, and highly recommend it if you want to
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.920]   dial in your health or his book that he recently wrote called Outlive. When it comes to doing a
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.280]   lot of health diagnostics, I'm actually working on an episode, so I'm going to pause and not go down
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.640]   that rabbit hole of blood tests, other things like that. I think that's it for health and fitness.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.120]   Maybe the only other thing is kind of like workout gear. It's probably no surprise to
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.200]   people who've been listening for a while that pretty much everything I wear when I'm exercising
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.480]   is Viore. That goes for non-exercising, like recording a podcast, I have some Viore pants,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.840]   I have a Viore shirt. Three of my favorites, which was really hard to think about narrowing down to
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.040]   the Sunday Performance Joggers, the Strato Tech Tee, and the Core Shorts. Those three products,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.760]   I own multiple of all of them. I wear all of them at least once or twice a week.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.480]   I recently got another hoodie from Viore, and it's incredible. I just can't say enough about
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:29.360]   their products. I wear them 90% of the time, and they're fantastic. When I'm not wearing Viore,
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.840]   there are a couple other brands. I might as well go here because I don't have a big fashion section
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   in this podcast. If I want to dress it up a little more, there is one shirt that's basically become
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.400]   my go-to, and it's the Bonobos Riviera short-sleeve dress shirt. It's basically like I know my exact
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   size. I know my exact fit and length. Someone actually asked me a couple of weeks ago, "Where
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.000]   do you go to buy non-workout gear? What's the adult thing to do? Do I really need to go to the
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.360]   mall now?" My suggestion was go to a Bonobos store, and they'll measure you for every fit,
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.440]   and you can just buy everything there. Now, this doesn't work for women as well as men,
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.800]   but I just found it to be so easy. Now, I have all my sizes there. If I need things, I can just
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:20.000]   order them, and they have free returns. Those Riviera shirts are incredible. I probably have
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.720]   six or seven of them. Almost everything I wear is more athleisure. If I'm going out,
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.960]   it's probably more in the Bonobos Riviera with a pair of jeans. Then, if I really need to dress up,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:39.040]   I have a couple of suits that I got 12 years ago for our wedding, custom-tailored suits from
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:44.800]   Indochino. I still wear the two suits I got from my wedding, and they're the only two suits I have.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   They've lasted 12 years, and it's been fantastic. The only other thing in that camp is Gooder
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:56.480]   sunglasses. I probably own five or six pairs of Gooder sunglasses, and they're great for working
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.520]   out. They're cheap enough that if you lose them, it's not the end of the world, and you can replace
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.200]   them pretty easily. That's kind of in the clothes camp. Everything else is like I buy socks at
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:14.320]   Costco. I really like Mack Weldon underwear. I would never pay as much as it costs, but because
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:20.400]   I have a platinum card, I use my Saks credit every six months to buy overpriced underwear
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.000]   from Mack Weldon on the internet. Maybe I'm just cheap. Maybe underwear should cost $30 per pair.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.360]   I don't know. It seems expensive, but I like their underwear. I just don't want to pay for it,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.520]   so I do pay for it, but with the Saks credit from the Amex platinum card. Next, let's talk about
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.720]   travel. I didn't have that many things for someone who likes to travel a lot and is a
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.280]   core topic of the show, so I thought I'd highlight a few. One is the Flighty app. It's really
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:53.120]   fantastic. They have a great sheet to show up on your iPhone when you're waiting for a flight,
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.840]   so you can just kind of keep an eye on it. When anything happens, I usually get an alert from
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.880]   Flighty before I've even gotten an alert from the airline. Each flight, they give you an arrival
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.960]   forecast, so it shows you how frequently is this flight early, on time, 45 minutes late.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   Where's the plane coming from? What kind of plane is it? They give you the detailed timetable of
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:20.240]   not just departs at 2.30 for this random flight, but taxi scheduled for 10 minutes. It's going to
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:26.640]   depart at 2.40. It's going to land at 11.07, gate arrival 11.22. Here's how long it's going to be
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.360]   in the air. Here's my history on the route. I pulled up a random flight from LA to New York,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.880]   and it says, "Hey, you actually took a flight, United 82, from LA to New York on June 5, 2010."
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.240]   I don't think I could go in and find out whether it was delayed or not, but it's also great for
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   sharing your flights with others. When it comes to packing a bag, I've got a lot of options.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:53.520]   For suitcases, we have one Away's bag. I love their Weekend bag also. We've got a Manos bag.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.800]   I can't really tell you which one is better than the other. They're pretty similar.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.680]   If I have a backpack, it's going to be a Tortuga backpack. They're so well built.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.880]   They're really, really quality. Everything from even the tech organizer that you can get from
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.000]   them to the day packs are just fantastic. Love them. As for where to go, I'm not going to go
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.480]   down the path of hotel chains and that kind of stuff. Then one other travel product that I love,
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.440]   and I'm holding it in my hands right now, is this tiny little travel router. Based on my search on
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:28.880]   Amazon, there are some better ones now. This one is the GLiNet 300M Mini Smart Router. The reason
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.200]   I love this product is because if you ever join a hotel Wi-Fi and you notice that usually you have
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.040]   to authenticate with your room number and some sort of login, well, that's fine if you're on a
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.840]   phone or a computer, but there are a bunch of devices that can't do that. Whether that's a
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:50.400]   Roku stick or we travel with our camp baby monitors that are on Wi-Fi, they can't do that.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.040]   You bring this little travel router that costs less than $30, and you can either connect it via
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:02.000]   Ethernet or Wi-Fi, and it will repeat the Wi-Fi out with its own Wi-Fi network so that you can
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.480]   have all those other devices join the router's Wi-Fi network. Through your laptop or your phone,
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.400]   you can log into the router and go through the authentication. Basically, use your computer to
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:21.440]   sign into your hotel Wi-Fi on this device through the web, and then all these other devices that
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.040]   can't do that can get online. If you are staying at some old school property that limits how many
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.240]   devices you can have, which I have stayed in a few like that, this also gets around that restriction.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.760]   For $30, anytime we're traveling, at least with all the kid stuff that needs to hook up to Wi-Fi,
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.640]   or if we're going with family where there's going to be more than two or three people in a room,
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.960]   always bring this travel router. Love it. If anyone knows a better one, let me know,
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.600]   but I can at least say that this one, which is linked in the show notes, is fantastic.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.920]   On the points and miles front, so many episodes, so I'll just breeze through a few things.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.080]   Go to episode 152 if you want to know what cards are in my wallet. Another travel one is the app
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.440]   and browser extension Card Pointers. Specifically, if you have Card Pointers Pro, whenever you're
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.880]   logged into your Chase, Amex, Bank of America website where they have card-linked offers,
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.160]   like add this to your card, spend 200 on Delta, get 50 bucks free, those kind of offers,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:28.640]   Card Pointers will automatically load all of those offers into your Amex account or your Chase
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:35.040]   account so you don't have to manually add them. Then, anytime you're shopping on those websites,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.720]   it'll pop up and not only say, "Hey, this is the best card to use," but also, "Hey, you have an
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.440]   offer that you should use on this site. Make sure to use this other card because you're going to
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:52.160]   get a bonus." Love the Card Pointers offers because they log all the ones you register.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.360]   Let's say I'm at Bed, Bath & Beyond. I can open up my app in Card Pointers, search Bed,
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.320]   Bath & Beyond. It'll let me know if I have one of those offers loaded so I know which card to use.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.680]   I've easily saved hundreds of dollars because of these card-linked offers and big fan of Card
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.720]   Pointers Pro. Shout out to Emmanuel, who's a listener of the podcast and also the guy behind
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.120]   Card Pointers Pro, for which, in the show notes, there's a discount, as there is for a lot of the
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:23.200]   products I mentioned. When it comes to tracking your points and miles, I don't think there's a
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.960]   great solution because so many of the airlines have blocked the ability for people to log in
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.360]   and see your balance. But the best of all the products out there is Award Wallet. When you
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.200]   combine it with their browser extension, they get through most of the way. You can even forward some
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.560]   of your monthly emails such that they'll get a full picture. It's not perfect, but it is the
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.800]   best out there. I guess when it comes to optimizing which cards to use, I use the optimizer tool that
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.840]   I built. You can get it at allthehacks.com/cardtool. When it comes to all the other award search tools,
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.280]   I'm not going to cover them in this episode. Go check out episode 166 and 167 with Greg from The
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.680]   Frequent Miler. We went through all of them. I wasn't sure where to put auto stuff, but I guess
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:09.280]   if we're talking about travel, maybe it fits in there. We own a Tesla. Love it. I can't imagine
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.960]   owning a different car. Basically, I've now become accustomed to the interface and how good it is,
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.720]   and I get in family members' cars. I'm like, "Why are there all these buttons?" If you do have a
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:25.760]   Tesla, there is one product I do love a lot called TeslaFi, which basically you can auth to your
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.280]   Tesla account. It'll log all your drives, give you all kinds of stats about what you're doing.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.480]   I've used it for so many reasons, primarily to track business versus personal, but it is just
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.360]   great for, "Oh, how long did that drive take? Oh, I can go look." It's like if you basically had
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:47.280]   a odometer tracking, but with all the information out there. I imagine if you had kids and a Tesla,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.200]   it would be a great way to keep an eye on where the car is. When it comes to car insurance and
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.080]   really any insurance, go back and check out episode 104, all the nuance of all the research
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.600]   I've done trying to optimize all my insurance policies are there, including homeowner's
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.200]   insurance. On the topic of smart home, I think I'll start with my favorite, which is Ubiquiti.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.160]   Ubiquiti makes all the Wi-Fi gear we need. It's professional grade, and it just doesn't have the
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.520]   problems I've had with everything else in the past. No rebooting, no bad Wi-Fi quality, fast
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:22.320]   internet is always there. Love Ubiquiti. I would say it's not the easiest to set up for someone
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.520]   who's not very technical, but man, once you get it going, nothing beats it. We've tried Eero,
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.560]   we've tried Netgear. It's incredible. We also use Ubiquiti cameras, which are all local.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.760]   Some of them are Wi-Fi, some of them are hardwired, but they're all local. All the
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.400]   camera footage isn't getting uploaded to the cloud. It's going to the Dream Machine Pro,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:50.640]   which is our router and network storage for cameras in our pantry. Love Ubiquiti.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.560]   They don't do an alarm system, so we use Ring for alarms, we use August for locks. I wish they were
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.080]   all in one platform, but they're not. I tried to sync them all to Apple Home, which is as close
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   as we've gotten. Other smart home stuff. We recently bought a Samsung Frame TV and absolutely
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.440]   love it. It's fantastic. It has enough services hooked up to it that we don't even need an Apple
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:20.080]   TV, so we only have an Apple TV for old TVs. I can't say enough good things about the Frame TV.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.680]   It looks great in the living room when it's not on, which is most of the time.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:30.000]   Also, speaking of TV, I love the app TV Time. It seems to break all the time and not be the
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.040]   most reliable, but I haven't found a better way to track all the shows you like and get
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.680]   recommendations for other ones and track the schedule of what's coming up, so I love that.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.720]   Open to recommendations if there's something better. As I am for always, if you hear this
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.840]   and you're missing out on a certain product or service, absolutely let me know. Reach out. Podcast
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.320]   at allthehacks.com. I'd love to hear your suggestions. When it comes to music, we have
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:00.240]   Sonos speakers all over the house. Love Sonos. Hate the new Sonos app. It is terrible. I wish
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.280]   they would revert to the old one. So many problems, but you know a product's good when you're willing
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.400]   to put up with a terrible app just to use the product because you think the product's that good.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:16.560]   On the topic of home energy, we have a Tesla Powerwall and solar. It was here when we got
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.600]   the house. One of the products that was also here when we got the house, which is really cool,
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:28.480]   is called Sense. You hook it up at your electrical panel, and it monitors all the usage of your
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   electricity, but it also uses some sort of intelligence to figure out what devices there
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.640]   are on your system and kind of intelligently identifies them. It's really cool. So if you like
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.320]   monitoring your energy usage, the Powerwall does it at a macro level, but this does it at a micro
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.440]   level of which devices are on. You do have to label them, but it's pretty cool. If you want
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:55.040]   to spend a little bit more, and I haven't come around to it yet, but I would love to get a span,
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.880]   and that is a smart home energy panel, replaces all your circuit breakers with something really
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:07.040]   intelligent. You can monitor your usage and basically turn off a circuit from your phone
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.400]   if you're fixing a light or a plug or something like that. So really would love a smart panel
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.160]   from span, but I haven't decided to make that investment. It's one of those like would be cool,
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.720]   but I'm not quite sure if it's worth the cost. I'm sure if I had it, I would love it.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:29.440]   And then the last home thing is we have an eight sleep pod cover, and I love it. Amy loves the bed
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.680]   nice and warm. I love the bed to cool at night, and it's just game changer for sleep. So highly
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.280]   recommend the pod cover. I guess this is home, but maybe more on the entertainment side. I'm
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.400]   going to share a couple of things. One, Monopoly deal, fantastic game. I guess it's kind of in the
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.360]   home camp of things we play around the home. I'm actually not going to go through every game I
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.160]   have. I have 40 plus board games, so I'm going to find a way to share more about those in a future
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.000]   episode and some of my recommendations, but I'm just sharing the two that are small enough to
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.160]   fit on my desk that I could just kind of hold up in the video version of this. And the other one
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.840]   is coup, kind of like a small, fast playing card game for two to six people that requires a little
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.480]   bit of deception. So if you've ever played mafia or werewolves kind of in that realm.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.360]   And then one other thing in the game camp that's not a board game is the games magazine. Someone
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.800]   told me about this and I got a subscription and I'm so happy I did because it's basically just a
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.200]   bunch of puzzles in one magazine. And anytime we go on a trip, I bring it along. And, you know,
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.400]   if I have a couple minutes to myself, maybe the plane's taking off and, you know, there's not much
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.280]   going on. I'll just do some puzzles and learn about new types of puzzles I didn't know about.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.840]   Also in the home is like food and kitchen stuff. We get most of our food from Costco,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.960]   Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods. So we don't go to the grocery store that often, but we do go to Costco
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.360]   seemingly every week. Love Costco. And if we're not cooking or going out, we're usually eating
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:01.040]   Green Chef. We get about three meals a week. We've had over 100 meals from Green Chef. Love them
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.240]   healthier and tastier and kind of more flavors than some of the other meal kits we've ever tried.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.680]   Really love Green Chef. Another product that's kind of new to us that I really have been loving
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.080]   and actually convinced to become a sponsor after using the product was Dram. It's a sparkling
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:25.200]   beverage with really great natural flavors. And it's basically replaced all of the sodas,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.000]   soft drinks, everything in the house there. It's just really good. I'm drinking the mushroom cola
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   right now, which might sound crazy to some people that maybe don't like mushrooms, but is so good
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.440]   in the kitchen. As for cooking stuff, unfortunately, it's not still available,
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.880]   but we got a June Oven, which is a company a friend of mine started almost 10 years ago and
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:54.080]   use it every day. Loved our June Oven. Recently acquired a Ninja Creamy, which has a great price
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.760]   at Costco and have loved it for making protein ice cream. I'll link to a protein ice cream
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.840]   recipe in the show notes. Shout out to Sahil Bloom, past guest who turned me on to this.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:12.160]   And it's amazing, right? Just like milk, a little sugar-free Jell-O or some xanthan gum
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:18.000]   and protein powder. And it tastes just like ice cream. It's like a McFlurry, if that's your thing.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.520]   And I can't say enough of it. We have not used it for almost anything except for making protein
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:29.760]   ice cream. Another product I love is the Breville Tea Maker. Now, think of a kettle that can boil
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:35.200]   water. It does that, but it has a basket for loose-leaf tea. And you can set what kind of tea,
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:41.440]   and it'll boil the water, drop the basket with the loose-leaf tea in it, down, steep the tea,
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:48.400]   bring it back up, keep it warm. We got this when I was working at a startup for the office 14 years
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.960]   ago, maybe. And that is the one we have. This thing has worked every year for 14 years in a row.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.720]   Makes me really love Breville, to be honest. I'll put a link to a couple other Breville products
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.560]   we've since acquired, immersion blender, regular blender, and big fan of Breville. No affiliation,
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:10.800]   just love the product. Another product we have that I got as a gift, I don't remember when,
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:18.320]   is the Waring Pro Double Belgian Waffle Maker. And we love making Belgian waffles in this house.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:25.360]   Girls love them. Sometimes we use the Kodiak protein pancake waffle mix in it. Sometimes we
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.480]   go off the cuff and make it from scratch. But this is a double Belgian waffle maker. And there's
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.760]   just something about Belgian waffles that are great, but making them one at a time when you
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.320]   have a lot of people eating is slow. And so this one does two at once. Love this Belgian waffle
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.200]   maker. Another fun one that I read an article about, I'll probably, if I can find the article,
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:49.600]   link to it as well, is the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker. Now, this is a great example of a product that I
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.840]   love because it's so good, even though it makes something I don't enjoy. So I don't like hard
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.200]   boiled eggs. Amy does. But I learned about this product that is supposed to be like the best egg
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.640]   cooker. And people call it like the egg machine, but it's actually called the Dash Rapid Egg
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:10.400]   Cooker. It's less than 20 bucks. And throw a little water in, throw eggs, you poke a little
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:15.600]   hole in them that it comes a little poker, and you get perfect hard boiled eggs every time.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:21.120]   It is so simple. One button. Love this product. Would make a great like white elephant gift,
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:26.480]   honestly, if you need one up in the upcoming holidays, but really cool little product.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.680]   All the water bottles in our house are slowly getting replaced by Hydro Flask.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.600]   I think if Amy could be sponsored by one company, it would be Hydro Flask. It's like
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.360]   her favorite company ever. Love their water bottles. And then last, Coravin. We've really
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:46.640]   scaled back drinking alcohol in the house pretty significantly, but we still have all these bottles
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.520]   of wine. And so the Coravin is this fantastic device that basically puts a little needle
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:58.720]   through the cork, lets you pour a glass of wine out of a bottle and into a glass, enjoy it without
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.360]   ruining the bottle. So you can pour a glass out and then pour the next glass out a week or a month
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.800]   later. So really great way to be able to drink the wine you have, but not need to drink the
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:15.840]   whole bottle every time you want a glass. So that's most of the house stuff. I left kids for
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.640]   last because I know not everyone has them, but there are a couple of kids' products that at
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.560]   least for our stage of life have been invaluable. So the Hatch Rest Plus is our light and sound
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.120]   machine for the girls. Red light means it's bedtime. Don't get out of bed. Green light means
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.720]   it's morning. You can get out of bed. White light means I'm trying to make the room really bright
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.800]   because you didn't get up on your own. Can you please wake up? Worst case, we'll come in there.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:45.280]   But the sound machine built in also, great product. Nanit cameras, love them. We have them
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.480]   in and above the beds for both girls. And then when we're traveling, we have the travel stands
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.960]   and we use our travel routers so that we can use them anywhere. Really love the Nanit product.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.640]   As for toys, I love Love Every. They make this subscription box that comes every three or four
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.040]   months, starting from a small age all the way up until toddler. And you get these like well-crafted
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.880]   kind of Montessori-inspired, at least, toys for kids with a little guide of how to use them,
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.680]   how to educate your kids about them, how to help them learn. And just can't say enough things.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:22.160]   We've actually saved all of them. And so we've got this really cool collection that I don't know
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.560]   what we'll do with it. Maybe we'll put it on Facebook Marketplace when the kids are old
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.400]   enough. But really love, love every. When it comes to getting around in the car,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:39.360]   we got two car seats from our neighbors and we've loved them. So I can't say anything about buying
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   them, but the Clek Foomph and Flow car seats. Really big fan of them, even though we didn't
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:50.800]   originally purchase them. Shout out to Shannon and Joe for those car seats. Appreciate that.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:57.040]   And then if we're traveling, the Ride Safer Travel Vest is an amazing way to be able to keep your
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.880]   kids safe without having to lug a car seat everywhere. So have loved that product. Before
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:08.160]   our daughter was big enough, we use the Costco Scenera Next car seat, which is really light and
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.600]   portable. But the Ride Safer Travel Vest, now both girls are big enough to have one of those and we
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.680]   don't have to carry car seats with us or rent them. Two other quick things for kids. The Tony's Box
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.880]   is a huge hit in our house. The little box where you put a bunch of characters on it through some
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.560]   kind of RFID. And it is like a speaker that plays all these different stories from the different
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:38.560]   characters. Actually talked in a previous episode about how I use Chat GPT and 11 Labs to generate
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:44.240]   a story for kids that included our kids. So we'd have this story that was about them and their
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:52.320]   favorite things, and then used voice to narrate it in my voice. And so one of the Tony's is Daddy
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.440]   Tony, one of them's Mommy Tony, and they have stories that we created for the girls that we're
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:03.360]   reading, but was done all with AI. So that was really cool. And then the last is, I've talked a
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.600]   lot about how we have a au pair in the house, and we're going through the process of looking for our
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:13.120]   next au pair now. And for the next one, we've used Cultural Care as an au pair agency, and it's been
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.240]   really great. You can filter on as many criteria as you want, connect with au pairs, interview them,
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.600]   they kind of do all the sourcing so you don't have to worry about it. And they take care of all the
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.440]   logistics and the visa and that kind of stuff. So we've had a really great experience with all our
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.400]   au pairs from Cultural Care. Not really a child, but we do have a dog. And three things that I
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:36.640]   thought I'd flag there. One, Sunday's dog food. And we tried this new dog food Sundays a couple
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.160]   years ago, and all the problems were gone. You know, everything was nice and solid going forward,
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.600]   and we have never even considered another dog food for that reason. So big fan of theirs. I don't
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.320]   even know the brand, but we have this burrowing dog bed that's kind of like an igloo, if you would,
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:57.040]   but it's really just pops up a little and the dog can like kind of snuggle under it. Our dog's a
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.720]   visual and absolutely loves this dog bed. And then last, there's a really cool product called
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:08.240]   the Night Eyes Rad Dog, and it's a collar leash combo. If you're ever spending a lot of time in
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.840]   like an off leash dog park, it's a collar, but it has a dog leash attached to the collar. So
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:19.760]   really like that product. I think that wraps up almost everything except for the business stuff
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   and the podcast stuff, which I thought I'd leave at the end. So if you're interested in everything
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:30.000]   we use to run our business and run this podcast, stick around. If not, reminder that links for
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.840]   everything are in the show notes, a lot of discounts in there. So 20% off, 30% off, even if
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:42.400]   you're an All The Hacks member, first year free, or 50% off. So definitely worth checking out the
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:48.160]   show notes, allthehacks.com/stuff, or in whatever player app you're on, or just at allthehacks.com.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.920]   So last two sections, business. So there's a bunch of products, services, and companies that
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:58.480]   I work with on the business side. For all of our banking, I think my favorite picks are Brex and
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:05.200]   Mercury. For our amazing third member of our team, we worked with Oceans, which is a staffing agency,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:11.360]   and that's how we found Possany, who is the most incredible... Started out as an assistant,
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.400]   but has now grown into so much more, making sure everything's running. So shout out to her and big
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.600]   shout out to Oceans. If you want to explore delegation and hiring an assistant, check out
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:26.560]   the delegation guide I'll link to in the show notes. For taxes, I mentioned Gelt for personal,
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.200]   we use them for business as well. We use QuickBooks Forever, which I hated, and we finally
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:37.280]   just switched to an awesome new bookkeeping software called Kik, kik.co. Love it. We do a lot
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.160]   of our payment processing and invoicing on Stripe. We send all of our emails through ConvertKit.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:49.360]   We run all of our email addresses on Google Apps. We run the whole podcast, and I actually run most
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.800]   of my life in Notion. Probably deserve to be mentioned outside of the business section because
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:01.200]   we plan trips, we organize family, vacations, schedules, the girls' school, all that's in
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:08.000]   Notion. So use that all the time. For scheduling stuff, we use Calendly, though Superhuman just
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.240]   launched scheduling built into email. So the days of Calendly might be dwindling and that'll be
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:20.000]   another subscription I can save some money on. And then last is Zapier. I love Zapier. So this
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.240]   is like a nerdy optimizer's dream. It is basically a product where you can link up anything and
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:33.440]   everything and create all these rules to do things. So new episode comes out, go ahead and add it to
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.480]   our newsletter. Person makes a purchase on Stripe, send them an email on ConvertKit.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:46.880]   Someone checks off a to-do in Notion, send an alert to Slack. You can integrate with thousands
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:53.440]   of different services, and it's just so amazing. I could probably get lost in Zapier and just start
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:59.360]   building crazy stuff if I didn't have a little more self-restraint. Can't say enough great
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.400]   things about Zapier. We use it for basically putting together all the pieces of all of the
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:10.080]   products we have. At one point, I was taking data from Notion, creating spreadsheets to track it,
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.920]   using the numbers in the spreadsheets to create payment samples in Brex. And so it was tying in
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:21.520]   the bank, the spreadsheet, Notion, and even I think at the time, it was also adding to QuickBooks. So
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:27.360]   really awesome product there. For the podcast, for anyone interested, we have a bunch of different
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.480]   things we use. For remote recording, we're recording on Riverside. For editing the audio
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:38.880]   and the video, I'm doing all of my side on Descript. The amazing team at UpFire, which
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.360]   if anyone needs a podcast production company, would love to introduce you, shoot me a note,
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:48.080]   podcast@allthathacks.com. They use a whole suite of more sophisticated things for audio and video.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:55.920]   But for basic audio editing of a podcast, Descript is fantastic. As for hardware,
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.240]   I'm using a Shure SM7B right now to talk to. That is going through a Rodecaster Pro 2,
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.760]   which is overkill. But because we do the studio in person behind me, I wanted something that could
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:16.080]   handle three different mic inputs because there's two back there. For recording this, I have a
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.680]   teleprompter at my desk so that that acts as a second screen so that I can look directly into
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:27.520]   the camera. I also use it for some Zoom meetings and that kind of stuff. Really love the teleprompter
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:35.120]   for getting really high-quality videos. That video is coming from a Sony A7C, which is connected to
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:42.160]   the computer I'm on with a Elgato Cam Link. It's a Cam Link 4K, so you get 4K video from a really
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:49.840]   high-def camera with great depth of field. For headphones, I really love the Audio Technica
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:58.960]   M50X. They're over-the-ear headphones. They are fantastic. Maybe overkill if you're not
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.360]   editing audio or want to listen to music in a really great way, but really love them.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.760]   I actually have multiple cameras, so if you're watching the video of this, I have one camera over
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.680]   my left right now. Normally, I don't have three, but I have one camera over my left in case I wanted
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.000]   to show something on the desk. Then I have another camera over the right to show something on the
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.840]   screen. Mostly, I got two extra cameras for the studio, and then I thought, "Why not mess around
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:30.320]   when I'm recording these solo episodes?" I went on Facebook Marketplace and got two $500, $600
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:37.440]   Sony cameras, one ZV-E1 and one A6400. Those are my two backup cameras that we also use in
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.320]   the studio. For lighting, I've got an Elgato Ring Light on one side, which is pretty small,
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:50.960]   and then a really big Godox Light that's four feet wide and three feet deep and sits about six
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.600]   feet up in the air and really creates a lot of light, which I think is really, really important.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:01.760]   Let's see what else. If I'm traveling, I take the Shure MV7, which honestly, I would suggest
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:08.160]   to almost anyone because it's USB. It doesn't need an audio interface. It's cheaper. Great,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.840]   great microphone. Even if you just want to sound better on your computer, it's a fantastic
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.560]   microphone for not that much. If you want an even cheaper option, the first 50 episodes of the show
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:26.320]   were recorded on the ATR2100X, which I think is about $100 or less for a mic with a stand. I know
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.000]   a few people when I was working at Wealthfront that picked one up just because the audio quality
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.600]   was so good. A few other things for the podcast nerds in the room. I host the show on megaphone,
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.720]   though I'm seriously considering transistor as an alternative. I use chartable for a lot of
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:49.360]   analytics. Then for video, I recently got this device called the ATEM Mini Pro ISO,
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.960]   which is a bit overkill, but I really like redundancy here because the last thing I want
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.560]   to do is record an episode and lose it. All the camera feeds route through this little device,
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:06.000]   and it's hooked up to a Samsung SSD or a solid state drive, and it records all the camera feeds
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.040]   separately from the SD cards that are in the camera just in case there was an SD card failure.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:17.840]   If you go back to episode one with Lee Rowan on Travel Tips, you will find that that was the
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:23.840]   second time we recorded that podcast because the first time the SD card failed, and there was
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.960]   nothing I could do. I sent it to a repair company up in San Francisco, tried to salvage the data,
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:34.560]   couldn't get it. Ever since then, every bit of audio I record, every video I record,
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:40.080]   everything's redundant. We're getting two recordings for everything. That's how we're
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:46.480]   doing it. I think that's it. I think I've covered all the highlights of the products I use and love
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.960]   on a daily basis. There are so many more things. I'm sure if I just walked around the room,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.280]   there'd be other things. I'm curious if there are any categories I left off that people want to
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.600]   hear. I can save that for a future episode. Otherwise, thank you so much for listening.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.840]   I hope this was interesting. You can find links to everything I talked about in the show notes,
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:09.200]   including discounts and promo codes. Thank you so much for using them. Some of them are. Some
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:13.600]   of them are not affiliate links, but the ones that are obviously help support me in the show.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.160]   Thank you so much. Have a wonderful rest of your day. I will see you next week.
