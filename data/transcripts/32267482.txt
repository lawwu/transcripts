[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.320]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.960]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.720]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.520]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.680]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.880]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.180]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.000]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.860]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.760]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.400]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.340]   Well, listeners, I have a treat for you today.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.560]   My guest is someone very well-versed
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.800]   in all things classical conversations
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.760]   from a young age through his now working adulthood.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   We are gonna talk today with Daniel Shirley,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.680]   and we are going to be exploring CC+.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.880]   I know as many of our families look toward the fall,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.520]   believe it or not, summer is more than halfway over.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.960]   And as we focus on the academic offerings for the fall
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   and our family's planning,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.100]   many of you with students going into high school
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.440]   or well into their high school years
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.240]   have questions about what else is available
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.440]   academically for your student.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.480]   And so we have with us today, Daniel Shirley,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   who is the Classical Conversations,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   the CC+ Undergraduate Program Manager.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.120]   Daniel, thanks for joining me today.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.560]   - Yeah, thanks for having me, Lisa.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.880]   Glad to be back.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.280]   - I am excited about what you're gonna share today.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160]   I will be really honest.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.040]   When I first got involved with Classical Conversations,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.340]   when my family joined, my girls were young.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.240]   I was focused like most young moms and dads
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.960]   on making it through each day and doing the very best
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   and providing a wide range of experiences for my children.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.920]   And I occasionally looked down the road
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.120]   to the high school years,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.240]   and I had people ask the age old question,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   but what will you do when they get to high school?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.720]   And I had some answers and some of them were glib
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.560]   and some of them were well thought out,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.680]   but very few of them included dual enrollment.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.560]   At that point, I didn't even know what that was probably.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.320]   And I have to say it was a long time ago
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.040]   when I was in that position.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   So CC+ did not exist.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.040]   And so I am super glad for you to come on
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   and share with all of us this resource new to some,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.560]   but it's been around long enough to be well-established.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.920]   This resource, this program
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.120]   that families can take advantage of.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.480]   I wanna start though with your experience
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.260]   of the CC Challenge Program,
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.480]   because that's where most of us are coming from,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.680]   CC programs that we already understand.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   And I know, Daniel, you know the CC Challenge Program
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.160]   both from the student perspective
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.120]   and the director/tutor perspective.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720]   Now I'm guessing, actually I know,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.280]   that the challenge program was chosen for you.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.580]   You didn't exactly choose it.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.360]   I know your mom and I know your dad
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   and I know that they really believed this was the vehicle
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   for the best possible education for you
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.200]   and for your siblings.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.560]   But let me ask you this,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.800]   what did you initially like about the challenge program?
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   Yeah, I think one of my favorite things
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.680]   about the challenge program,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.720]   especially in the old days when things were still forming,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.240]   it really was this heightened sense of,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.460]   I would say like discipline equals freedom.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.360]   I think I told the story on the last podcast
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.400]   about when I transitioned from the foundations program
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   into challenge A and I had that syllabus for the first time,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.280]   challenge guide, and it was my birthday,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.840]   but I had an assignment due
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.200]   and I couldn't take my birthday off.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.440]   You know, there was this like sense of responsibility
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240]   and of completing the work
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.760]   that I didn't exactly have quite as fleshed out
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.640]   in the foundations program.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.160]   And so moving into the challenge program,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   that was really the thing, looking back on it,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   that I found very helpful to understand.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.680]   If I moved through the work,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.300]   if I completed what was necessary
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.600]   and brought the required artifacts to the community day,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.320]   I was free in some sense.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.920]   As soon as I completed those steps,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.080]   I then had my time to do with what I would like.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.260]   And I feel like that's a principle
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.320]   that carries pretty well into the adult world, right?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.560]   Although the responsibility has become more numerous, so.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.520]   - I love that.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   I love that, Daniel, that what you're saying is,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.800]   I mean, and it makes sense from the perspective
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.600]   of a young student,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.040]   the academics were maybe not what you loved the most,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.080]   but I love that you chose to show us
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.040]   a life skill, a life perspective.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.840]   The challenge program teaches us more than how to be smart
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   and how to learn even, learn in an academic sense.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   I like that you reminded us
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.360]   that part of what our students learn
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.680]   is how to manage themselves.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.280]   And you know, you're right.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.560]   It is a great awakening for a student to recognize
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.080]   that they are pulling the strings,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.200]   that they can dilly-dally around and waste the day
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   and then have to miss something that was planned for them
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.760]   or alongside of them because they have to get the work done
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.400]   and they chose to use their free time in a frivolous way.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.880]   And so I love that what you really appreciated
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   was learning about the power you had over yourself
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.440]   and your own schedule, that's cool.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.840]   And you know, the thing that kind of,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.240]   it goes hand in hand with this idea of learning
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.480]   how to learn a skill that's being trained
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.120]   inside the challenge program and curriculum.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.480]   'Cause you find that, let's say the more efficient
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.720]   you can be in your discipline,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.840]   the more freedom you have on the other end of that
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.560]   and the more productive that freedom can be.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.800]   Again, because that discipline doesn't just kind of stop,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   it continues to permeate your attitude,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.640]   not just toward your academics,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.200]   but also toward hobbies or other interests
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.520]   and relationships, friendship, you know.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.640]   Learning how to learn is not just constrained
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.000]   to that academic realm, which all of your listeners know.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.640]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.320]   It's a great reminder that as homeschoolers
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.080]   and as classical Christian homeschoolers,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.400]   we are developing our students' character
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.120]   alongside of any academic pursuit
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.160]   that we go at as a family.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.560]   We are developing character.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.360]   And what you're talking about is a character issue,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.400]   learning how to manage your freedom.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.200]   That's really great.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   So was there anything, and maybe there wasn't,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.040]   was there anything that didn't fit you as well
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.880]   in the challenge program, at least initially?
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   - That's a good question too.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   I think that because it was so early on when I used to,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.680]   'cause I mean, I think, you know,
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.200]   it's been almost, what, like 18 years since Challenger,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.040]   something like that.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.640]   - Yeah, that's a scary thought, Daniel.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.560]   - It's been a minute.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.320]   And so I think pedagogically or, you know,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.360]   the mode of the teacher or the tutor
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.080]   coming alongside the students in seminar
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.880]   or in the community day was still in formation.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.560]   And so looking back on it,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.040]   I do see very much how there were instances,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.960]   especially as I moved more into high school,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.920]   where even in the CC community day,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.880]   we would still do, you know, exams or tests.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.720]   - Right, right, yeah.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.800]   - That would then be handed in and graded
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.240]   and then handed back to us.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.720]   And it would be, you know, you've got an 87
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.960]   or you've got a 76. - Right.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.560]   - So there was still some pedagogical formation
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.200]   that I think is interesting
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.680]   based on the way that, you know,
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   CC has kind of come more into its footing with,
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.840]   oh, we don't really believe in the quantitative tests
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.600]   for things like human studies, liberal arts studies.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.440]   - Right, right.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.840]   - And there's other artifacts that we can engage with
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.320]   and see from the students,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.200]   like their ability to lead the seminar,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.080]   their ability to bring good questions in
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.920]   and to show mastery of the content
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.680]   in ways that are not, you know,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.040]   maybe quantitative in their work.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.880]   - Yeah.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.520]   I love that you brought that out
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.440]   because it gives me the opportunity to remind parents,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.720]   hey, y'all, we are still learning
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.560]   how to do this big, hairy, audacious task too.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.640]   And so 20 years ago,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.960]   okay, that sort of freaks me out too, Daniel,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.120]   20 years ago is when my family first found out
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.160]   about classical conversations.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   And the educator, the homeschooler that I was then
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.000]   is a far cry from the homeschooler that I became
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   as I learned, not just academically along with my girls,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.640]   but like you were saying,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.960]   as I learned the better pedagogy
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.840]   of being a classical educator.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.200]   So mom and dad, don't despair.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.840]   The educator that you are now
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.040]   is not the only educator you will always be.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.960]   And you will grow in your understanding
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.560]   of how to lead your homeschool more classically.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.120]   You're gonna grow along with your student.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.640]   And that is the beauty of this journey
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.520]   that we have together.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.560]   Let me ask you this, Daniel,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.840]   because I also know that you have been,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.960]   and I'm not sure if you are still,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   a challenge director yourself.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.600]   So what drew you into becoming a challenge director?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.160]   Did you enjoy that whole idea
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.080]   of partnering with parents and students?
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.440]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   That's what drew me into the,
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.400]   it was actually a kind of a legacy thing.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.080]   My mom was tutoring challenge four.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   Heather Shirley was tutoring challenge four
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.760]   at our local community.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.200]   And this was when she was still quite busy.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.720]   And so she ended up having to kind of step down
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.160]   from a long-term challenge four position
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.000]   in our local community.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.440]   And I had subbed for her a handful of times
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.000]   as I was getting settled in.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.040]   And she asked me,
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.920]   "Are you interested in moving into the tutoring space?"
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.960]   And I was like, "Ooh, I think this could be a lot of fun."
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.640]   And I was also curious, almost experimentally,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.520]   just to see what would it be like
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.880]   to be a challenge four tutor
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.080]   that was not a homeschool mom,
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.200]   or that wasn't like a parent of a student in community.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   Having been through the process
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.120]   of graduating from challenge four,
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.640]   maybe more recently, in your quotes,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.320]   than some of the other tutors,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.680]   what could I do to help prepare the students
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.040]   to move into the next stage of their education?
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.400]   If it was gonna be college,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.640]   or if they were moving into their family businesses
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   to work there, or doing trades, or something like that.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.680]   And then the other thing that I was interested in primarily
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.040]   was I'm an English kind of major.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.840]   I was interested in what would it look like
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.600]   to kind of reframe the art of writing
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.880]   for these challenge four students,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.160]   especially with the senior thesis process,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.800]   which was not in the challenge program
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.960]   when I was moving through it.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.720]   - Right, exactly.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.560]   - I was like, maybe if I could direct,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   and I can participate in this thesis process a little bit
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   that I didn't get to have.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.000]   But it was like essays,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.600]   often students will see essays as assignments
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.920]   governed by something like a quantitative metric,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.360]   like a word count.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.200]   - Right.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.680]   - And if they reach that word count,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.000]   they complete the essay.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.480]   - And they could be done.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.800]   - And they could be done, right?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.680]   I was guilty of this as a student as well.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.160]   - Sure.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   - But the more that I thought about it,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   I was like, I'm not sure that's why we write essays.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.840]   And so I wanted to get back into that tutoring space
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.880]   and play with this pedagogy,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   this more classical pedagogy of writing and why we write.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.000]   And while I was kind of digging down that rabbit hole,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.200]   I learned that the word essay is a French word.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.960]   I don't know, do you know what it means, Lisa,
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.000]   the word essay?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.560]   - It's to find out, isn't it?
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.480]   To strike out, to ferry forth.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.400]   - Right, yeah.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.040]   And it's like, it just means to get out there and to try.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.120]   And so, especially with the thesis,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.560]   I found it very encouraging and very satisfying.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.280]   And I think my students did too.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.680]   We could probably ask one of them at some point,
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.520]   but we'll see.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.200]   But the aspect of,
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.480]   don't waste your time writing about something
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.320]   that you don't care about.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.440]   And the theme of challenge four being leadership,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.280]   it's where you're leading your own education at this point.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   That's what you're getting ready to move out into.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.840]   There's gonna be less hand-holding
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.760]   as you move into the next chapter.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.040]   And so, you have to find what you care about genuinely.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.240]   And then that question that's kind of on the fringe
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   of your knowledge that you explore
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.480]   through slow motion thinking,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.120]   which is what I think writing is,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.760]   that was something I was just super excited
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.200]   to bring to the students and encourage them in.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.240]   And so, that, I don't know,
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.120]   is one particular thing that drew me in,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.600]   but then also just participating
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   in this kind of legacy of home education, different flavor.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.120]   - That is great.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.920]   What a good, I'm making myself a note now
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   to have you back in the fall to talk about writing essays
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.320]   and how to light the fire in students.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.240]   Because I think that you struck something really key,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.480]   Daniel, if we can help students understand
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   that they are writing not just to satisfy a prompt
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.400]   or a word count, but what we need them to do
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.160]   is somehow connect with this piece of literature
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.900]   or this point in history or this thing
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.520]   that they're supposed to write about
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.720]   and find what lights their fire.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   I love that.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.200]   So, I'm gonna be knocking on your door again,
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.240]   is what I'm saying.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.360]   So, I want you to think, for just a minute,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.720]   I want you to think about students that you have known,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.760]   because as a challenge director,
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.040]   you have interacted with a lot of students
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.000]   and a lot of families.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.480]   And as the CC+ undergrad program director,
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.640]   you've interacted with a lot of families.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.040]   Think about students and families that you've known,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.120]   that you've talked to,
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.840]   maybe who were just considering the challenge program.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.920]   As challenge directors, we've all had people contact us
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.440]   and say, "Well, I'm sort of interested,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.040]   "but I don't really know."
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   What drew those people to challenge programs?
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.840]   And also, what gave them pause
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.000]   or made them hesitate to join?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.560]   Yeah, this is a really good question.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.640]   I think it's worth thinking about a good bit.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.840]   And there's at least two things that I find
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.680]   that draw people in.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.200]   And they're pretty fascinating,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.680]   because I feel like mostly, it's not all,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.280]   but a lot of students or families get drawn
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.240]   to something like CC or to CC,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   based on negatives out in the other options, right?
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   So, I would say one of the primary reasons
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.440]   that families will reach out and inquire.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.840]   Into the challenge program is just the environment
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.320]   of public education,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.200]   being something that they see is hostile to the values
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.400]   that they hold and their family has.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.920]   So, that's a big one.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.520]   Yep, yep, yep.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.360]   The other one would be possibly like the excessive cost
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.480]   of private education options.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.600]   And so, those are like the negative reasons.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.440]   And then, so I'd say that probably makes up maybe 75 to 80%
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.320]   of the students that I've talked to.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.160]   All right.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Then the others are, they see the books that we read,
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.280]   and they just get super excited.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.800]   Yep, yep.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.160]   Those are fun.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.720]   Those are quite fun.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.960]   But the others, the others are also good.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.760]   It's just maybe that sometimes they come into the program
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.280]   based on a criticism of something else,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.880]   rather than a desire or a fascination
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.320]   with what it is that we're up to.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.080]   Yeah, you're right, you're right.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.880]   People are running away from something more often
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.920]   than they're running to something at times, it seems like.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.960]   So, what do you think, what gave them pause?
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.200]   What made some of the families you interacted with
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.920]   hesitate to join a challenge community?
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   Yeah, I think this ties back
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.640]   with this discipline equaling freedom thing.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.680]   Once you start understanding, maybe you go to a practicum
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.360]   or you start investigating the challenge guide
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.240]   for the coming year, and then you recognize
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.520]   that really you're only meeting one day a week
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.280]   with the community, I think that families
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.120]   start to recognize that the responsibility
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.720]   of the program gets kind of, you know,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.200]   like it's supported by the community and by the tutor,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.280]   but it's sat squarely in the family's lap.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.480]   And that particularly gets intimidating
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.800]   for the high school years.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.920]   Students move into that and they start realizing,
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.960]   oh, okay, cool, this is gonna be a lot of work,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.000]   I'm gonna have to be more disciplined than I am already.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.760]   And, you know, parents have to be comfortable
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.440]   administrating their own homeschool,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   which I feel like if you're not maybe in that camp
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.320]   of like unschooling, you know, kind of,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.040]   you trust institutions still,
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.560]   then it can be maybe a little bit intimidating
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.160]   to recognize that you're the principal
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.400]   and the administrator of your homeschool,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.440]   putting that seal on a transcript, so.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.800]   - Yes, and, you know, there are still lots of us
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.400]   who look at some of the subjects in the challenge years,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.640]   physics, I'm looking at you,
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.280]   and calculus, I'm staring you down.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.280]   And they are, or Daniel, even the literature
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.400]   for parents who say, I don't really,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.640]   I've never been a good writer,
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.960]   how am I supposed to assess my students' writing?
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.520]   And if I think it's not quite up to par,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.600]   I don't know how to fix it.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.520]   And so I think that that plays into it too,
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.160]   just that we feel, well, we fear
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.040]   that we can't give our children the best education,
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.880]   what we really want for them,
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.400]   because we feel a lack within ourselves as parents.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.760]   So I think that that can happen too.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.200]   - Yeah.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.040]   - I've also, and I wonder if this has been your experience,
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.240]   I've also encountered families that hesitate
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.200]   to join a CC community because they've been enticed
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.160]   by the idea of dual enrollment at community colleges.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.040]   - Oh, for sure, yeah.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.480]   And so before we get into that,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.120]   I wanna take a step back to parents being intimidated
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.640]   by the literature real quick.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.480]   - Yeah.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.120]   - It's funny, there's a introduction that C.S. Lewis writes
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.840]   to "On the Incarnation" by Athanasius, I believe.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.960]   - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.000]   - And it's a really good essay,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.280]   so I encourage all the listeners of the audience
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.640]   to go read that essay if they haven't read it before.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.440]   There's some iconic C.S. Lewis quotes
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.160]   that come out of that essay.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.960]   But one of the things that he says
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.240]   is that we should read old books,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.880]   and that if we decide and actually just kind of step
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.440]   across that threshold and enter into the old books,
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.000]   the quote-unquote primary sources, right?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.440]   Sources that are not anyone writing about anything else.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   So I'm not reading a modern commentary on the Iliad.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.440]   - Right, right.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   - Instead I'm going to read the Iliad.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.120]   He says that when we do that,
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.480]   we often find that the original text
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.840]   is much more approachable than the commentaries
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.080]   that are written about that text.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.280]   And so if we've, in our modern sentiment,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.000]   read a modern piece of material about an old book,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.440]   we come away and we're like,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.680]   wow, that old book is very complicated.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.560]   And I think people would be refreshingly,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.840]   or would be refreshed to actually just step
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.200]   into some of those old texts like Lewis suggests that we do
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.920]   and recognize that there may be more hospitable
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.400]   than the modern commentaries, so.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.240]   - You know what?
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.160]   That is very wise counsel.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.520]   I think a lot of us are turned off
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.840]   to what we might find lovely
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.160]   and approachable by the reputation
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.320]   that some of these subjects or works of literature have.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.240]   Somebody has told us that it's too high brow for us
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.440]   and we bought into that.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.280]   You are right.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.360]   And there is almost always something
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.920]   that will resonate with you
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.040]   if you read something you think is too hard for you.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.880]   You will find something to grab onto
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.080]   and it grows from there.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.920]   So I love that.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.360]   Thank you for the reading suggestion as well.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.680]   That's great.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.560]   That's great.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.800]   So let me ask you, have you heard people who say,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.240]   well, I'm either going to do the challenge program
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.680]   or I'm going to do dual enrollment
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.120]   because I think I can't do challenge and dual enrollment.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.840]   It would just be too much.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.320]   - Yeah, I often find that they kind of say that,
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.000]   but they say that, I guess, by their actions
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.440]   rather than actually, it's kind of like,
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.360]   they don't drop out of the challenge program entirely
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.200]   all the time.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.680]   - Right, right.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.600]   - They'll be like, I was directing challenge
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.440]   for two years ago and probably I had a class of eight,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.440]   six of them were probably enrolled
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.040]   in dual enrollment somewhere
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.920]   and they were doing the challenge program.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.120]   And obviously that tension,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.920]   it's real inside the classroom,
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.680]   whenever you meet on that day,
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.040]   'cause they're tired from going to class early that morning
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.480]   or maybe they're coming in or doing something.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.840]   So often the challenge program does get deprioritized
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.960]   if not dismissed altogether for the sake
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.200]   of something like dual enrollment.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   Yeah, it's common.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.400]   - Yeah, so people don't necessarily
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.360]   stop being challenged students.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.480]   They just stop being challenged by the work
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.400]   because they don't do it as much.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.200]   They just let that go off.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.080]   Well, I know, like I said before,
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.200]   when I became a challenge director years and years ago,
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   there was no programmed answers for people wanting,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.920]   for families wanting a dual enrollment experience.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   So tell us how CC+ came about and why it was developed
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.960]   and then you can just go ahead
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.720]   and tell us the pluses of the program.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.160]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.480]   So CC+, we've been playing with this for a little while now,
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.160]   kind of what is the mission and vision of CC+
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   and really I think it's this idea of opening college doors
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.520]   for classical conversations families.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.640]   Our goal is to shrink that kind of perceived obstacle
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.360]   of college as a barrier for homeschool families
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:33.320]   and for classical conversations families in particular.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.680]   And when students are going into the dual enrollment space,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.600]   families are putting their kids into community colleges
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.160]   to give them like a taste of the college experience
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.720]   before they just send them out.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.280]   And I think it really, I mean, it's kind of,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.480]   it's not always a bad idea,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.400]   but we think that there's probably a better way to do it.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.080]   And that's why we kind of, you know,
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.760]   have started developing this program
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.000]   is so that we can have students enter into
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.800]   and get a taste of the college experience
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.640]   while they're still in the community of their homeschool
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.760]   and their classical conversations group,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.560]   but they're interacting with college professors
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.480]   and with college level work.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.280]   And, you know, whatever that means,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.640]   that's happening inside the CC+ program, so.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.520]   - I like that.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.440]   It is a way to spread your wings
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.840]   while you are still on the flying field of your family,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   you know, within their care and they are there.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.560]   I love the idea of experiencing college
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   and interacting with even more outside mentors
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.440]   than your challenge tutor,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.200]   while still being under the authority
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.840]   and guidance of your parents.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.360]   I love that.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.320]   So those are definitely pluses that I agree,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.240]   that I can see and the benefits to families
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.840]   and to the students.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.680]   So what's the, okay, so in CC+,
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.640]   the students are still part of a CC community.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   So what's the plus stand for?
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.000]   - Yeah, so the plus originally as an idea
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   was meant to be kind of to indicate the partnership
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.920]   between CC and another institution, a college most likely.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.760]   And so it would be like classical conversations
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.640]   plus Southeastern University,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.520]   or classical conversations plus Bryan College
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.240]   or any of the other, you know, colleges
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.600]   that we've partnered with through the years.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.200]   Southeastern University is our primary partner
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.160]   and the plus is kind of indicates
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.440]   the additive relationship.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.120]   - Okay, that's great, the additive relationship, yeah.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.960]   - Yeah.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:07.320]   But in regards to like the why CC+ does what it does,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   why we're plusing with another institution is,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.000]   I mean, obviously a huge one in the world today
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.280]   is gonna be cost.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.600]   And families, you know, especially with the way
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.760]   that the, you know, just the kind of economic norms
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.800]   are headed and the way that they are right now,
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.240]   everyone's looking to save some way somehow.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   And the traditional model of dual enrollment
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.360]   being, let's say, free in a lot of states
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.960]   and then these dual enrollment programs
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.520]   having a partnership with another institution
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.600]   that's then very expensive
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.440]   and they're kind of directly funneled.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.480]   Like the free dual enrollment inside the current model
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.240]   will almost always make the money back some way somehow.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.520]   It's free to get students in the door
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.400]   and then they charge you money after you've committed
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.680]   and are, you know, on a track.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.960]   - Yeah, the Tonstoffel from challenge one
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.200]   is a real thing in the real world.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.800]   There is no such thing as a free lunch, yep.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.720]   - Exactly.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.160]   And so one of the things that we've done
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.720]   is try to optimize this cost model.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.160]   And so we thought,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.720]   well, why don't we do something kind of backwards?
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.960]   Let's charge a little bit of money for the dual enrollment,
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.520]   or we call it the concurrent enrollment program,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.400]   which is still like right around midline of a cost
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.200]   for normal dual enrollment programs at 167 per credit hour.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.240]   But we align it with all of the challenge curriculum
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.360]   and the assignments from the guide.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   And so that makes it a time save
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.640]   because students focus all their attention
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.320]   on one set of curriculum
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.680]   and are doing all their assignments from there.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.640]   And then rather than charging them a bunch more money
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.840]   when they enroll as a student at a four-year university,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.760]   that's where we have the undergraduate program,
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.440]   which is basically an inversion of the model
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.800]   that the free dual enrollment
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.440]   funneling into expensive four-year education.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.320]   We have dual enrollment that's priced at a moderate level
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.560]   and then funnels into an incredibly affordable option
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.120]   with the undergraduate program.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.200]   And so that is something
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.920]   that I encourage everyone to check out.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.200]   If you're a parent of a CC student
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.800]   or if you're a CC graduate
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.440]   and you want to move through your bachelor's degree,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.720]   we have an option for that and degree plans.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.240]   It's all on our website, classicalconversationsplus.com,
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.480]   but we're really proud of this program
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   and SEU has been pretty awesome to work with
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.280]   to create this undergraduate option.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   - That's really great.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.880]   So you gave us a ton of information there
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.040]   about two programs that are,
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   they're sister programs, but they're different
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.240]   because you talked about the concurrent enrollment program
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.800]   and that would be for students
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.200]   who are still in high school, correct,
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.840]   who are also going to get college credit.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.200]   And we're gonna talk about that
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.680]   'cause I have a bunch of questions for you.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.560]   I think my listeners really want to know.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.080]   And then the second program that you mentioned
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.680]   is the undergraduate program
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   where students could continue their relationship with SEU
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.960]   and get a bachelor's degree, right?
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.200]   Okay, awesome, awesome.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.640]   Now, I know that there are parents and families,
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.880]   especially at this time of the year,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.160]   who are very eager to get the details
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.680]   about this concurrent enrollment program
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.360]   or 'cause maybe they're interested in enrolling this fall
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.880]   and time is drawing nigh and it's getting short.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.120]   And then we have families that want to add it
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.720]   into their planning options down the road
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.760]   so they can think about it.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.200]   So I want you to tell us all the things, okay,
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.560]   but also tell my listeners one more time
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.440]   where to find all this information again
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.240]   when the podcast is over
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.640]   so you can give us the website again.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   And then if there are any counselors or real people, Daniel,
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.000]   that they can call or contact in some way to talk to,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.600]   that would be awesome.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.760]   - Yes, for sure.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.560]   Okay, so we'll move through this
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   and maybe I'll ask for a reminder
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.760]   of the string of questions in a moment.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.040]   Okay. - Oh yeah.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.360]   - Number one, classicalconversationsplus.com
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.000]   is gonna be where you can go to find all the information.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.440]   On that website, there's a get started button
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.680]   on the concurrent enrollment page.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.560]   That button takes you to a registration guide.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.240]   On that registration guide is a information portal
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.280]   with way too much information.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.400]   (laughing)
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.840]   And so if you wanna just do some reading,
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.440]   follow those kind of prompts that I just gave
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   and you can go in,
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.920]   you can see brief descriptions of every course
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.880]   that we offer in alignment with the challenge curriculum.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.320]   I believe there's 29 different courses.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.160]   - Wow, okay.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.600]   - With assignments all listed out
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.960]   and materials drawn from the challenge guide.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.240]   So you could look into and investigate every course
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.520]   available with the concurrent enrollment program
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.480]   before signing up for any of them.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   - Gotcha, that's awesome.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.360]   Fact finding mission, good.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.440]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.600]   So that's definitely something to check out on the website.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.920]   As far as counselors go,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.480]   obviously there's gonna be a contact us option
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.520]   at the bottom of the website for our email
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.240]   and then I believe it's my phone number.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.720]   - Oh, well you may soon find out my friend.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.480]   - Yes, that's on the bottom of the website.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.280]   And so I will be happy to talk with anyone
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.080]   about the CC plus and point people in the right direction
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.760]   for what they need to do.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.560]   There's also a concurrent
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.240]   or on the undergraduate program page,
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.880]   there's a student consultation option.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.280]   And so we've partnered with another institution
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.560]   called Solid Rock Consulting
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.880]   and they offer complimentary student consultations
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.640]   to all of our CC families.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.400]   And so if you're interested in getting more information,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.000]   you can also go there and schedule a consultation.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.400]   So those are a couple of ways
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.440]   that you can get in touch with people
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.160]   to learn more about the program
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.040]   and to kind of begin the journey.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.880]   - Okay.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.920]   - But again, there's a ton of resources available
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.960]   off the get started button on the website
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.680]   for concurrent enrollment.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.520]   So.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.360]   - Thank you.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.640]   I just wanted to be sure
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.000]   that I did not forget to ask you that
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.880]   because I know that after people listen to this podcast,
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.880]   they are going to be very interested
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.000]   in finding out more information.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.600]   And I wanna be sure that people know where they can go
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.680]   to get all the information and more
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.560]   than they really thought they needed.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.160]   So I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.600]   Some we have probably already covered,
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.320]   but I want the listeners to have all this information
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.920]   grouped together in the same point in the podcast.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.640]   So you mentioned that the college,
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.440]   the university that is providing these dual enrollment
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   or concurrent enrollment credits is Southeastern University.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.240]   Tell us a little bit about Southeastern University.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.520]   What are their credentials?
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.160]   Is this, I mean, I know that CC would not partner
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.000]   with an organization that wasn't top-notch,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.120]   but tell parents something about SEU.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.400]   - Yeah, so I think the fun thing to talk about
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.720]   when it comes to college credit, families always ask me,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.000]   I was on a call with 14 families,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.760]   I mean, just two days ago on my CC plus office hours,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.320]   which happens every month.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.720]   That's on the registration guide as well
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.280]   for families that wanna be on a video call with me.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.520]   So the partnership with Southeastern University
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   is pretty awesome because SEU has been very diligent
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.080]   at kind of paying to Caesar what is Caesar's.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.240]   Maybe that's a good way to think about it.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.720]   In the way that they are accredited
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.200]   through a regional accreditation body,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.680]   which is the highest accreditation body
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.280]   in the college environment.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.880]   It's kind of the status quo.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.320]   If you're gonna be even a state school,
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.280]   they're all accredited through these institutions.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:58.360]   SEU is a level six regionally accredited school,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.280]   which means essentially that they have programs
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.600]   through PhDs that are all accredited
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.560]   by these regional accreditation institutions.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   And so the credit from SEU is as legit a college credit
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.800]   as you can find anywhere,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.760]   I guess is the kind of takeaway.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.680]   - Yes, good, because frankly,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   that is the kind of question that I get too.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.080]   Well, this concurrent enrollment option sounds really good,
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.480]   but how can I be sure that these credits my student earns
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   are gonna transfer to the four-year college of their choice?
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.880]   What if it turns out not to be Southeastern University?
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.600]   Are all these colleges my kid is interested in
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.000]   gonna take these credits?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.080]   And so that sets our minds at rest,
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.440]   that level six accreditation is awesome, awesome.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   - Yeah, and I can give your listeners one key tidbit as well
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.760]   regarding the transferring process.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.560]   So every university has what I call
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.360]   the "keeper of the credits."
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.840]   And this role is titled registrar.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.640]   Usually if you contact the college,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.680]   you can choose to be funneled to their registrar's office.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.640]   And with the resources that we provide
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.520]   either through our customer service email,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.000]   ccplus@classicalconversations.com,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.640]   or the course descriptions that you can pull off
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.720]   of the student information portal,
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.280]   usually families have enough information
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.720]   if they know the school that they're looking at
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.840]   to get in touch with the registrar,
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.480]   to show them the brief descriptions
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.520]   or syllabi of our courses,
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.520]   and request a transfer evaluation
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.040]   before completing the course.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.840]   So there's options for families to go ahead
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.360]   and do the legwork with the university.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.560]   But once that legwork is done, there's a precedent set.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.880]   So all of the courses that CC+ students have gone
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.680]   and gone ahead and transferred credits into,
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.560]   all of those courses will now have a gateway
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.640]   or a pathway for future CC+ students
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.600]   to be confirmed in their transfer credit.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.720]   So that's really important,
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.800]   and that's been going on now for about five years.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.640]   So that's really good.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.600]   - Well, that's awesome.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.440]   That means that students who are entering the program now
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.480]   and hoping to go forth have had people
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.840]   already break the barrier and pave the road for them,
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.680]   a little bit.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.040]   That's awesome, Daniel.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:37.880]   Thank you.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.200]   That is very encouraging.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.000]   Okay, so now as a parent, I'm thinking,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.640]   well, this sounds awesome.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.560]   Let us sign up right now.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   Tell, who can participate
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.160]   in this concurrent enrollment program?
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   How old does my student have to be?
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.800]   What level of challenge?
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.520]   Why can't they participate as early as I want them
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.480]   to talk about that?
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.320]   - Sure.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.760]   So we try to strike a fine line.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.960]   We have some potential programs in the works
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   that are gonna be oriented toward prep for CC+.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.600]   If families are interested in that,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.560]   I'll be working on that a little bit more
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.880]   over the next probably couple of years.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.840]   But right now, the program starts in challenge two,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.360]   and we have the fewest offerings available in challenge two
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.080]   just to make sure that the family doesn't get too distracted
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.960]   by the CC+ coursework.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.400]   But challenge two, three, and four students
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.040]   can all participate in the concurrent enrollment program.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.920]   - Good, good.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   And so what are some of the signs
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.080]   that a student would be a good fit
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.120]   or that CC+ would be a good fit for my student?
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   - Yes, I remember when I discovered this
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.120]   after working with the program for a little while.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.360]   The only students that ever have trouble
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.600]   really with the CC+ program are students
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.280]   that are not used to being very administratively sharp.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.240]   So I would say if you have a student that keeps a calendar
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.440]   and they check their email on a regular basis
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.960]   and are diligent and tenacious communicators
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.280]   over the plane of the internet,
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.560]   then you're going to have a student
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.920]   that can be very successful inside of CC+.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.320]   It's really just a case usually of missing an email
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.880]   from a professor or closing a browser too fast
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.360]   when you thought you uploaded an assignment
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.800]   that gets students in trouble.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   - Okay, so they have to keep a careful watch
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.400]   on the interface.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   It's not the same thing as saying,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.880]   "Well, I handed it in."
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.600]   You actually have to be sure that you clicked the button
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.240]   to upload your assignment.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.680]   - And this is a skill set now
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.120]   that's actually universal
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.080]   across the world of college education,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.120]   which makes it more important.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.640]   Like even if you're in person on campus,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.720]   you're still going to be uploading an assignment
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   on a platform like Canvas, like Brightspace, like Blackboard,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.920]   like even the in-person schools now
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.160]   are using these LMSs, Learning Management Systems.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.720]   You're not handing a piece of paper
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.920]   into a professor anymore in most cases.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.440]   - You're signing off on a learning module online.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.400]   Yeah. - Exactly.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.600]   - So, okay, let me ask you this.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   What help do you guys provide to families and students?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.040]   Because I know, now my girls are older,
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.240]   so they're done with college,
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.120]   but I remember when they went to college
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.200]   and they started talking about these,
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.480]   you know, Canvas and all these billboards
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.840]   and all these learning platforms,
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.400]   and I was like, "I'm sorry, I cannot help you with that.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.000]   "I do not understand."
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.880]   I mean, I used to turn my paper in in the professor's office
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.120]   if I didn't give it to him in class.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   So do you guys provide some help to students and families
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.940]   who are learning that system?
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.420]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.460]   So we have our, I mean, that's a majority
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.920]   of our customer service is oriented in that direction.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.500]   And I mean, that's what I do.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.100]   That's what our counselors do.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.260]   That's, everyone does a little bit of helping students
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.980]   figure out what that process looks like
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.660]   to exist in this course shell.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.900]   - That's awesome.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.620]   - Yeah, that's a big part of the skills
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.380]   that we're developing in the CC+ program.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.700]   And so most of our team is oriented
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.500]   at helping students navigate that,
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.460]   but really trying to teach them how to fish
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.620]   instead of giving them the fish.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.220]   You know, there's really an emphasis
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.080]   on this continuation of lifelong learning
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   and of learning the skills of learning
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.580]   just in a different domain.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.540]   So that's the bit.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.340]   There's helps on the student information portal
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.580]   for navigating these portals
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.100]   or navigating these course shells.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:18.280]   And there's also, there are videos inside
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.700]   this learning management system as well
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.000]   that are oriented toward teaching the student
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.100]   how to navigate.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.340]   So- - That's awesome.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.320]   That's awesome.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.860]   Good, because I just, I appreciate you offering us
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:35.380]   reassurance that there are resources to help us.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.140]   This is gonna be new information to a lot of families.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.420]   And so I want them to know that there is support out there
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.540]   to help them learn as they go how to do this.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:51.220]   Okay, so what subjects, what courses are offered
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.620]   in concurrent enrollment?
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.140]   And just, you can just, I mean,
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.780]   you don't have to name all of the courses, Daniel,
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.740]   but like, are they literature courses?
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.020]   Are they history courses?
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.360]   Are they math courses?
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   What subjects or strands have CC+ connections?
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.140]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.860]   I wanna say almost all of them.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.700]   - Wow.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.900]   - Whereas I know in challenge two, we have Latin,
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.660]   we have Western cultural history, we have college algebra,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.100]   we have biology, and we have English composition.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.860]   So that's what, five out of the six strands?
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.820]   - Wow, yeah.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.340]   - And that pattern is essentially repeated
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.300]   for all of the challenge programs.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.900]   I believe that the only one,
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.940]   one of the only ones that we do not have
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.060]   a CC+ concurrent enrollment class for
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.100]   is physics at this point.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.380]   - Gotcha.
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.100]   - But that's because I don't think
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.740]   that Southeastern University actually has a physics class.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.380]   - Okay, so maybe we'll help them grow into a new direction.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.220]   - Maybe so.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.140]   - You never know.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.420]   So how many CC+ credits
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:07.260]   could my student pursue each semester?
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.900]   And maybe even a better question is,
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.900]   how many do you guys counsel them to do per semester?
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.460]   - Right.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.700]   So it depends on what your aim is.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.900]   The world is becoming increasingly, let's say modular
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.300]   in the sense that students and parents kind of expect things
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.500]   to be tailored to their own experience.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.540]   - Yes.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.420]   - And so one of the things that we have done
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.580]   with the CC+ program is set it up
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.380]   to where in concurrent enrollment,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.860]   you can choose kind of two pathways.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.700]   - Okay.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.900]   - The first one is kind of a la carte picking
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.900]   of one to two courses per semester of your challenge journey
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.860]   and ending up with about, I don't know,
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.660]   maybe almost two semesters of college done
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.540]   by the time you finish the challenge program.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.380]   - Yeah.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.100]   - So you save yourself a year of college
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.820]   and then you move along and do whatever it is
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.380]   that you're going to do next.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:06.340]   Or you can choose, and this is for students
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.020]   that really feel administratively comfortable
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.060]   and are really confident in their ability
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.220]   to deal with the LMS systems.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.060]   You can choose to pursue an associate's degree
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:22.460]   from between the timespan of challenge two to challenge four
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.460]   and graduate challenge four with an associate's degree.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.660]   - Wow.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.780]   - If you wanna do that,
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.340]   that ends up being about 60 college credit hours,
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.700]   which comes roughly almost to a full load
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.940]   in regards to classical conversations plus courses.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.060]   You need to talk to one of our counselors
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.100]   before you do that,
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.740]   just so that we can make sure that you're set up,
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.220]   you're moving along the right path
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.820]   and that you will indeed graduate
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.580]   with an associate's degree.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.420]   - That is so interesting.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.940]   And I know parents, you might just be thinking,
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.220]   but I have 10 questions about this.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:00.020]   We can't actually cover that in a 50 minute podcast.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.780]   So the website is your friend.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:06.980]   Like Daniel said, there's way more information there
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.020]   than you probably will want to chew up in one mouthful.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.980]   So you can find more answers and deeper answers
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.620]   to some of these questions on the website.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.540]   So Daniel, I know we're starting to run out of time,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.140]   but I wanna ask, what are the courses like for students?
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.660]   Is it a lot of extra work?
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.860]   Are there additional lectures or workshops
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.980]   or sessions to attend?
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.660]   What is it like to do a course?
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.700]   - Yeah, so one of the primary features
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.700]   is the time saving component.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:44.460]   And that means that the classes function asynchronously.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:49.460]   And so there is no like designated meeting class time,
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.740]   even in online chat rooms or anything like that.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.700]   It's the community day comprises the entirety
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.460]   of the quote unquote class time of the course.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:06.260]   And so families can look at the course descriptions
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.020]   obviously to get more detailed information.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.580]   But one thing I can say is every CC+ course
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.940]   has you do less work than what's in the challenge guide.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.140]   - Wow.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.100]   - Which is pretty important.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.700]   Like, so the assignments are gonna be kind of picked
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.380]   and chosen from the suite of assignments
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:28.260]   in the challenge guide that suit the particular course
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.580]   that the student is trying to take.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.060]   So like composition one will have six essays
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.020]   over the course of a semester.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.940]   The students are gonna write probably more than six essays
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.740]   over the fall semester of challenge two.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.900]   If it's anything like when I did challenge two,
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.220]   I think we wrote like 21 essays over the course of that.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.540]   - Oh yeah, in those days you did.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.260]   - Yeah, and so, and I'm sure that the writing is still,
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:56.300]   there's still more than we choose in the CC+ courses.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.980]   And so that should encourage families
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.460]   that the content, the material,
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.620]   and the challenge guide is abundant.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.860]   And we've actually tailored things a little bit
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.620]   to suit the particular courses
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.460]   that we're accomplishing with SEU.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:13.020]   - Good, that, man, that sounds amazing
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:17.500]   that my student could get a good education,
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.220]   a good classical education,
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.620]   and they could do this concurrent enrollment.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.020]   And we probably wouldn't die
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.380]   because it's not so much more work.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.860]   That's awesome.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.700]   That's very awesome.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.380]   So let me ask you this,
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.940]   how would people get registered for this fall
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.580]   or is it too late for this fall?
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.340]   I'm guessing not.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.780]   - No, it's not too late for this fall.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.260]   The first step would be to go on and apply.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.940]   And so that again is accessible from the get started button
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.780]   on the concurrent enrollment page on our website.
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:55.340]   After you apply, you don't need test scores.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.460]   You don't need anything like that.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.860]   We have this relationship with SEU
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.180]   that allows for what we call directed mission.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.620]   And so this is becoming a trend
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.820]   in the higher education world.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.220]   Basically, it means that if you're a CC student,
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.980]   you get automatically accepted into Southeastern University.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.540]   And so you can apply.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.740]   The acceptance process should take somewhere
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.780]   between two and 48 hours for your student to get an email.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.060]   Then they log on to their student portal
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.980]   and then just like click everything, read everything,
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.980]   get comfortable in this new ocean of a college system,
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.460]   and then watch some of the tutorial videos to get signed up.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.700]   - Wow, that is awesome.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.860]   That is so awesome.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.780]   What's the cost, Daniel?
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.740]   What's the cost for CC Plus, the concurrent enrollment?
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:53.340]   - Yes, so the cost for the concurrent enrollment program
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.140]   is $167 per credit hour,
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.380]   or roughly $500 per course that you add on.
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.460]   And so if you think about it,
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.900]   most of the time students will take one to two courses,
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:11.900]   and this is roughly the same as paying for challenge,
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.940]   is the two course cost
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:18.260]   to do a Classical Conversations Plus program.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:21.100]   Families and students,
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.660]   because we've got the payment system
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.100]   going through Southeastern University now,
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.380]   can try to apply scholarships or grants that they have.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.140]   Usually those don't apply
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.860]   for a quote-unquote dual enrollment phase of education.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.100]   I would definitely pay for the undergraduate.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:42.780]   Or they could also use something like a 529 plan
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.500]   to pay for those courses as well.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.020]   So there's a myriad of options
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.620]   now that our payment system is a little more integrated.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.460]   - That's cool.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.380]   Are there any scholarships
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.540]   for concurrent enrollment programs?
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.220]   - Not for concurrent enrollment programs
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.500]   too much at the moment.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.580]   There are certain grants that can apply
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.580]   for the student that's still in high school
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.860]   applying funds to a dual enrollment
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.900]   or concurrent enrollment program.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.700]   Those are few and far between,
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.820]   and usually tend to be associated with,
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:19.220]   let's say like there's different,
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.940]   I know that there was one that I encountered
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.380]   that had something to do with
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:28.260]   being like a indigenous Native American.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.260]   - Okay, okay, yeah.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.900]   - So something like that,
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.140]   but they tend to be few and far between.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.020]   - And very narrow in focus,
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.060]   and very narrow in participation, yeah.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.860]   - Right, so some of those,
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.660]   I would steer away from the ESAs.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.740]   They're available in Florida
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.180]   that cause you to have to shut down your homeschool
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.780]   to receive funds to then be able to pay
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.140]   for alternate modes of high school education.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.300]   I was talking with someone on the phone
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.860]   about that the other day.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.300]   So really not too much for the concurrent enrollment,
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:07.180]   but when you get into the undergraduate,
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.020]   the world of scholarships really does open up quite a bit.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.540]   - Gotcha, gotcha.
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.980]   This has been so awesome.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.060]   You have shared some really good information.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.860]   I think families are gonna be ready.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.740]   Some people to act on it probably this fall.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.940]   Some people may file this
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.580]   and be working toward a concurrent enrollment plan
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.460]   for their challenge student once they hit challenge two.
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.340]   Daniel, thank you so much for sharing your insights.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.340]   Let me ask you one last thing.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:41.340]   To you, what is the best thing about CC+?
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.620]   What's the main reason to check it out?
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.700]   - I think the main reason to check it out
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.340]   is it really has to do
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.020]   with preserving the attention of your student.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:57.060]   I find that we know that the curriculum that we're pursuing
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:58.540]   and the way we're pursuing it
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.420]   in the Classical Conversations classrooms
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:06.420]   is oriented toward what is John Milton says,
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.460]   "Something like the goal of education
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.540]   "is to correct the folly of our first parents."
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:14.260]   And that's the attitude that we try to preserve
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.700]   inside the space of the classroom.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.740]   And that's the attitude
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.300]   that I feel like gets a little bit lost
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.740]   when we start paying attention to the secondary things
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.340]   instead of the one thing.
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.180]   - Yeah.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:30.180]   - So preservation of attention is, in my mind,
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.780]   that's kind of a motivation for why I do what I do.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.740]   - Wow, that's awesome.
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.180]   That is awesome.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:40.180]   I appreciate these insights.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.900]   You've given us a lot of good things to think about.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.900]   A couple of good things to read
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.540]   and a website that can fill in all the chinks
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.260]   you and I might have left open.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.300]   Thank you, Daniel.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.220]   I appreciate that.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:56.940]   Parents, if you are eager to find out more
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.940]   about what Daniel shared with us today,
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:03.940]   don't forget you need to go to ccplus.com
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.780]   and click the Get Started button
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.940]   and you will find a wealth of information there
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:14.540]   that can fill in the gaps for you and for your family.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:19.540]   And parents, if you are feeling a gap in yourself
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.620]   as a classical educator,
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:27.620]   I want to remind you of a great program
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:32.180]   that can help you fill those gaps,
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.060]   the classical learning cohort.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.500]   You know, at CC, we believe that education
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.460]   is the responsibility of the family
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:43.420]   with support from fellow believers.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.780]   So if you are looking to grow in confidence and competence
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.580]   with these classical tools of learning,
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.660]   the classical learning cohort can meet your need.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.180]   They meet regularly online
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.380]   to practice the tools of learning.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.660]   It's through discussion and some presentations
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.460]   and through some assessment.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:08.180]   If you are interested in pursuing this for yourself,
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:13.180]   join the conversation at classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:16.900]   All right.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.820]   I am so glad, Daniel, that you joined us today
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.820]   and I'm already looking forward to talking to you again
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.620]   in the fall about writing.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.500]   - That sounds awesome.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.780]   Thanks for having me on, Lisa.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.620]   - Thanks.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:32.540]   All right, parents, go and enjoy a summer day
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.060]   with your kids and I will see you next week.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.640]   (gentle music)
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.700]   you
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:50.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
