[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   For God who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.240]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:25.600]   Now that, I think you'll all agree, is a very noble passage, one of the great and striking
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.760]   masterpieces of literature.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   But in addition to that, of course, it is a tremendously important passage.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.000]   Because here we find this great and mighty man, the Apostle Paul, telling us a little
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   bit about himself.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.720]   He didn't normally do that, but he does so at this point.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.480]   And he tells us something about his work as an apostle and as a preacher of the gospel.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.800]   Now the reason that led him to do this is quite simple.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.960]   We are told that partly in this epistle and partly in his first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.440]   it was that there was a good deal of misunderstanding in the minds of many people with respect to
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.500]   the apostle, as to whether he was entitled to call himself an apostle.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.360]   In other words, there were certain people creating trouble in the life of the church
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   at Corinth.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.040]   On this very matter, they were querying Paul's authority, and therefore they were querying
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.200]   his message.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.440]   There was great trouble very often in the early church due to that kind of thing.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.520]   So the apostle, in order to deal with this misunderstanding that had arisen, which was
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.280]   not only causing trouble in the church, but likewise, of course, preventing the witness
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.080]   of the church from being as effective as it should have been in the lives of men and women
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.240]   round and about them as a church, the apostle takes it up.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.040]   Even now his concern is not about himself.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.560]   He didn't care very much what people said about him personally and individually.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.920]   He's already told these people that in the first epistle he says with me, "It is a very
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.480]   small thing that I should be judged of you or of men's judgment.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.880]   Yea, I judge not mine own self, for I know nothing by myself, yet am I not hereby justified
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.000]   but he that judgeth me is the Lord."
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.080]   He wasn't concerned merely to defend himself, but he has to take up the matter because involved
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.160]   in the apostle himself and his whole position was the message that he had preached.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.320]   If they could cast doubt upon him as the messenger, in the same way they were able to cast doubt
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.000]   upon the validity and the truth of the message which he had delivered.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.960]   So the questions were, "Who is this man Paul?
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.120]   Why should we listen to him?
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.140]   Why should we accept his message?"
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.320]   In other words, you see, the problem raised was this great problem of authority.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.240]   Now I think that this is still a very great problem with a large number of people.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.640]   They say, "No, I hear you preaching that gospel."
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.160]   But the question I want to know is this, "Why should I believe it?
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.560]   Why should I believe what you're saying?
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.880]   What's your authority for what you're saying?"
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.160]   I believe there are many who are not Christians this evening simply because they stumble at
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.560]   this whole question and matter of authority.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.840]   You see, you say this, but there are other people who are contradicting everything you
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.240]   say.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.440]   And there are others who are saying that there's nothing in this at all, and they're turning
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.560]   to philosophies and to various other ideas and teachings.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.660]   Now they say, "Why should we listen at all to this message of yours?"
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.560]   It's a very important question.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.520]   The Christian is a man who should know what he believes, and he should know further why
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   he believes it.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.040]   Christianity, you know, isn't just some vague feeling.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.840]   To be a Christian doesn't just mean that you've got a nice feeling inside you, and that you're
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.240]   a brotherly, friendly fellow.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.280]   No, no, you can be all that without Christianity at all.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   There are many nice people who are not Christians.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.920]   There are many good people who are not Christians.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.520]   There are many friendly, brotherly people, people doing an exceedingly great amount of
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   good work.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   They're not Christians at all, and they don't pretend to be.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.240]   So to be a Christian is none of those things.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.440]   The Christian, I say, is a man who believes something primarily, and he knows exactly
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.760]   why he believes it.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.800]   Now the apostle was very vitally concerned that these people should know exactly the
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   position.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.320]   They should know who he was, his authority as an apostle, and they should know therefore
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.920]   the authority with which he spoke, and why they should therefore pay heed and attention
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.360]   to what he had to say.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.800]   This especially over and against people whom in the eleventh chapter later on he refers
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.080]   to as false apostles, who are not apostles.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.120]   People who are preaching lies, contradicting the truth, as the apostle had been preaching
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   it.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.200]   Well, very well, you can see that this is a very important and a very urgent matter
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.920]   today.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.960]   The apostle here in a sense tells us why he was preaching at all, and he tells us at the
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.240]   same time what he was preaching.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.440]   I know of no better passage, no better statement, which really puts the modern position, it
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.960]   seems to me, very clearly and in a nutshell, as it were, before us.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.280]   You see, we are still in this same position.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.120]   People are still asking, "Why should I believe it?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.040]   Why should I bank my whole future upon it?"
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   People are asking that question.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.400]   "Why does the Christian church go on?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.200]   What justification have you got for standing before the world at a time like this and preaching
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   that very message?"
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.720]   Well, now then, here I say is his great answer, which we are going to begin to look at this
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   evening.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.240]   Now, it seems to me that a very good way of approaching the whole thing is to remind ourselves
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   very hurriedly once more of the background, of the story of this extraordinary man.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.440]   Why is it important?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.720]   Why is it important for us to know something about this apostle Paul?
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.960]   Well, the answer is this.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.560]   Our whole authority at this moment, my whole authority as a preacher of this gospel in
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:47.120]   this pulpit, ultimately rests upon the testimony and the witness of these apostles.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.560]   This same apostle Paul, in writing his epistle to the Ephesians, tells them that the church,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   the Christian church, is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.200]   Very well.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.400]   It's very important, therefore.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.360]   You can't brush this man aside.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.920]   There are more of his letters in this New Testament than anybody else's.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.640]   And throughout the centuries, this man's teaching has been presented to the world as
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   the gospel.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.440]   These apostles, he's one of them.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.320]   But now, his case, you remember, is a very special one.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.800]   The other apostles had been with the Lord Jesus Christ during the three years of his
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   ministry.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.480]   Peter, John, Jude.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.800]   These men had been with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.360]   They had traveled with him.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.880]   They had heard his sermons and addresses.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.760]   They had seen him working the miracles.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.320]   And they were with him, watching when he was crucified and died.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.960]   They saw him after his resurrection.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.000]   You remember, they were gathered together in an upper chamber, and he appeared to them
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   and spoke to them.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.560]   They were with him when he was taken up into heaven from the Mount Olivet.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.240]   They were all gathered together in Jerusalem on that great and notable day of Pentecost,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.200]   when the Holy Ghost came down upon them and filled them with power and understanding,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:19.120]   and sent them out as blazing preachers of this message concerning Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.520]   But this man was not with them.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.080]   This man was then Saul of Tarsus.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.720]   And as you remember, he told King Agrippa and that Roman governor Festus on that occasion,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.360]   he was not only a Pharisee, but he was an opponent of Christianity.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.240]   He hated it.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:43.400]   Saul, he heard about this Jesus of Nazareth, he abominated, he reviled his name.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   And as he goes on to say, he thought he was doing God's service by massacring Christians
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.800]   and blaspheming the name of Christ and persecuting these Christians.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.480]   He was exceedingly mad.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.880]   He thought it was all wrong.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.480]   I verily thought with myself, he said, that I ought to do many things contrary to the
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.080]   name of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.960]   And he did so.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.040]   And yet here he is preaching the gospel.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.480]   Now then, here is the great question.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.040]   What turned him into a preacher?
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.520]   Why did he ever preach Jesus Christ and him crucified?
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.880]   What is his authority?
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.640]   What explains this man?
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.560]   You have got to start with him.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   Why do his letters appear here with those of these others?
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.960]   Why are they put alongside the four gospels?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   Well you have had the answer already in the reading of that twenty-sixth chapter of the
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.840]   book of the Acts of the Apostles at the beginning.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.560]   It was that thing that happened on the road to Damascus.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.320]   Here is a man who suddenly, while he is going down the road, breathing out threatenings
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:56.560]   and slaughter against Christ and his people, suddenly sees the light in the heaven above
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   the shining and the brightness of the sun.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:11.520]   And that blessed face and the voice crying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.400]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.640]   And he replied saying, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.560]   And the answer came back, "I am Jesus, who thou persecutest."
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.640]   And from that moment this man was not the same, completely changed.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.240]   He becomes a preacher of the gospel.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.840]   He becomes one of the apostles.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.600]   He is put into the same position as those others who had been with the Lord during the
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.000]   three years and whom he had chosen out of all his followers to be this inner circle
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.360]   whom he taught and whom he trained and to whom he gave his message.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.760]   He is added to them.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.360]   And so he stands with them and is one of them preaching this message.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.920]   Now then, that's his background.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.520]   And amongst other places that he visited as a preacher was this town of Corinth.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.360]   And as a result of his preaching, many people there had seen the truth.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   Their whole lives had been changed as his had been changed and they had become members
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.480]   of the Christian church and he is now writing to them.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.740]   And he reminds them of certain things about himself and his preaching.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.640]   That was his ultimate authority.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.960]   He had seen the risen Lord.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.720]   No man could be an apostle if he hadn't seen the risen Lord.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.480]   The apostle was primarily a witness to the resurrection.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:38.160]   And he, as one born out of due time, as he puts it in his first epistle, as one born
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.320]   out of due time, he saw him.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.520]   And so he became a witness.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.240]   Now then, listen to what he says about his way of preaching.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.960]   And these things are very important.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.360]   Notice his negatives.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   What does he preach?
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.160]   Well, he tells them here quite plainly, "We preach not ourselves."
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160]   The apostle didn't talk about himself.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.040]   He wasn't preaching to please himself.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.280]   He's very concerned about this.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.240]   People were suggesting that he had been doing that very thing.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.880]   That he was doing this in order to make himself some great one.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.840]   That he was doing it in order to make money.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.500]   There were all sorts of hack orators going round the world then as they still are.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.840]   And they were making a living out of it.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.600]   And some suggested that that was the truth about this man.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.720]   He says, look here, he says, "I can appeal to your consciences that this wasn't true."
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.520]   He says, "We have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.760]   nor ending the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.720]   ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.920]   He says, in other words, "I welcome investigation.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.560]   You can examine me and all I've done and said."
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   I'm not afraid.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.440]   He said, "I call your consciences to witness that that is what I did."
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.080]   He wasn't out to preach himself.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.040]   He wasn't out to get a following.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.020]   He wasn't out to become popular.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.200]   He wasn't out to make a name for himself.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   Now, my friends, these things are important.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.800]   There are many people in the world tonight who are speaking solely in order to do something
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   for themselves.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.880]   I don't want to be unfair to them, but there are many in politics who are doing that.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.480]   They're primarily concerned about themselves and their own careers.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.840]   Isn't that very often true about our newspapers?
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.960]   We are told a great deal today that they're keeping their eye on the costs and on circulation.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.040]   It must pay.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.760]   The first thing about a newspaper is that it must pay.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.960]   Not that it gives news any longer, you see, but that it must pay.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.920]   So everything's going to be geared to this one idea.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.080]   It's got to pay.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.400]   If everything becomes subservient to that, it must pay.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.600]   We've had examples of newspapers changing their policy because they saw the one they
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.560]   were adopting wasn't very popular.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   So they switched it over.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.520]   They dropped certain things and took up others.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.200]   Now, that's what the world is full of.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.080]   The world is full of this kind of dishonesty, every man out for himself.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.240]   And the ultimate motive is self-aggrandizement in some shape or form, popularity, having
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.520]   a great crowd to listen, great congregations, great this, great that.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   "Oh no," says Paul, "I preach not myself.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.440]   I'm not concerned about myself."
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.880]   He said, "I ask you to bear witness and testimony to that fact.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.520]   You bring a single instance or illustration," he said, "of where I did anything or was
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.280]   in any way governed by self-consideration.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.800]   No, no, not myself."
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.360]   But then, not only that, and following from it, of course, he wasn't out to please men.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.200]   "We have renounced," he says, "the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness."
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:01.640]   Now, you see, there are many men who are concerned to please us and they flatter us.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.680]   And they use their guile and their flattery.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   Why?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.360]   Well, of course, as I say, in order to be successful.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.800]   That's why the newspapers are always praising us in some shape or form.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   We are never wrong.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.000]   It's always somebody else.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   It's always something else.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.560]   If you want to be popular, you've got to praise people.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.800]   And the more you praise them, the more they'll like it, and the more they'll take from you.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.720]   You look at it on your wireless and television and you get it there.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.400]   The whole time, in a sense, they're playing up to you, getting at you, getting around
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   you.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.840]   "No, no," says Paul, "I don't do that.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.680]   I've renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, and I don't walk in craftiness."
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.600]   Oh, the craft that is being manifested and used in this modern world.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.240]   How they get at us, wheedle us, get round us, persuade us.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.800]   Craftiness, the subtlety of the advertising, and all these other things.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.080]   It's done deliberately in order to catch us and to entice us.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.280]   And there are people who are doing that with their messages, with what they teach and preach.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.360]   That's their one interest, so their men please us.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.000]   "Now," says Paul, "I'll put you into the witness box.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.020]   Can any of you," he said, "say honestly that I was just playing up to you, pleasing you,
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.240]   saying the things I knew you'd like to hear, telling you how wonderful you were, telling
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.520]   you that you'd never had a chance really, that you mustn't believe that you're a sinner,
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.720]   that of course you're a very good fellow, that all that talk about sin, it's all wrong.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.040]   Man's a very wonderful creature.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.720]   He's a very noble being.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.040]   There's nothing really wrong in him.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.320]   He's only had a chance.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.240]   Now," says Paul, "can anybody say that I preached that to you?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.560]   Did I use any of this guile or dishonesty, this craftiness?
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.440]   Did I try to ingratiate myself with you by thus pleasing you and flattering you and just
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.840]   giving you the thing you wanted and the thing I knew you wanted?"
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   And on it went.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.320]   "No, no," says Paul, "you know perfectly right well that it isn't true.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.080]   He's already said this to these Corinthians in his first epistle.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.520]   You see, he said there at the very beginning that he came unto them at the first in weakness,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.800]   fear, and much trembling.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.400]   And my speech and my preaching," he said, "was not with enticing words of men's wisdom.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.960]   He deliberately divided that.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.640]   I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified," he said.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.300]   He didn't put on any show.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.040]   He did nothing to attract them.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.920]   "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.720]   He didn't start lecturing on Greek philosophy and then on Greek art and sculpture and all
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.920]   the rest of it and then at the end just bring in a little bit of gospel.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.440]   No, no, there was none of that.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   He never lectured.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.960]   He preached and preached in utter simplicity from the beginning.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:56.360]   Not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.280]   That was his speech and his wisdom, the wisdom of God, he says.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:07.040]   And here he is really repeating this selfsame thing.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.840]   It was nothing, he said, at all to attract anybody save the plain statement of the truth.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.320]   He hadn't got a paid choir.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.040]   He hadn't got some form of preliminary entertainment just to soften the audience a little bit and
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.880]   to get them into the right psychological condition for him to do what he wanted with them.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   None of that at all.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   There was nothing.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.960]   You remember when he first came to Europe?
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   He arrived at a little place, a city called Philippi.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.280]   Now this is to me one of the most astounding things that has ever happened in the whole
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.480]   course of human history.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.480]   Christianity comes for the first time to Europe when the apostle Paul entered the city of
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   Philippi.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.200]   Europe at the time was completely pagan.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   Here comes this messenger of Christ.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.920]   How do you think he opened his campaign in Philippi?
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.360]   Well, of course, we know what's done today, you see.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.880]   You first of all get at the organs of advertising and propaganda and so on.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.520]   You try to get the mayor of the town, the Lord Mayor, whatever he may chance to be,
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.480]   to come at your inaugural meeting and you put on a great show.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.200]   You make a great impression.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.080]   You know what Paul did?
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.360]   He walked round the town for a few days and he heard that there was a group of women,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:28.120]   a little group of women, of Jewish women that met on Sunday afternoons, not in the city
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.040]   but outside the city wall by the side of a little river.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.240]   Just a little group of women who met together to pray to God.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.320]   This man went out that Sunday afternoon and without anybody knowing that he was there
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.440]   at all or that anything at all was happening, he just went out and sat down by the side
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.360]   of the women and spoke to them the word of God.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.560]   That's how he began his Christian campaign in Europe.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.320]   He was doing the same thing in Corrumb.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.720]   Not as a men pleaser, not using any craft or dishonesty, not getting at people, not
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.000]   getting round people in order to be able to boast of his results.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.080]   No, no.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.760]   He says he's renounced all that.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   He doesn't come in at all.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.720]   Wait a minute, there's one other thing.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.920]   He says he doesn't adulterate the gospel either, not walking in craftiness nor handling
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   the word of God deceitfully.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.520]   This is very important.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.920]   What he means is this, he didn't adulterate it.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.320]   He gave it them as it was.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.840]   He didn't mix his own ideas with it.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.080]   He didn't say, "Now I don't quite like this, I don't agree with this."
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.480]   He didn't say, "I know they won't like that.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.960]   If I say that, I won't say that.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   I'll keep that back.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.320]   And I know they're Greeks and they're philosophers.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.400]   Well, of course, I must bring in a bit of that."
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.640]   He said, "No, I didn't do it.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.200]   I didn't handle the word of God deceitfully.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.400]   I didn't adulterate it.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.080]   I didn't introduce my own ideas.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.560]   I didn't take anything out because I didn't think they'd like it.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.480]   I didn't add or subtract.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.360]   I didn't adulterate or pollute.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   I gave it exactly as it was."
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   That's what he tells us.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.400]   Listen to him.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.520]   This is how he puts it here.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.240]   He uses a very interesting word.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.560]   He says, "He's renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:30.480]   nor handing the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.880]   ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   What's he mean?
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.200]   Well, this is what he's saying.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.040]   Take this word "manifesting."
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   What an interesting word.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.800]   Do you know what he's really saying?
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.560]   He said, "You know, this is what I was doing.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:52.240]   He said, 'I, you know, was just like the men who worked the curtain at the theater.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.520]   People gather together, the curtains down.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.520]   They see nothing.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   Nothing's happening.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.480]   But there's a man whose job it is, at least I take it that it must be, I want her to do
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:06.200]   it as a boy in school, whose sole purpose was to pull back the curtains or send them
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   up, whichever it is.'"
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.600]   Now that's the kind of word the apostle uses.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.520]   He says, "All I did was this.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.200]   I just drew back the curtain.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.280]   I just manifested the truth.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.760]   I allowed them to see it.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.600]   It wasn't I.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:26.080]   I was just the man who pulled back the obstruction so that they might see."
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.440]   That's the meaning of manifestation, making visible, unfolding, holding forth.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.200]   These are the words, making bare.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.360]   These are the meanings of this great word that he here uses.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.680]   And this is the whole essence of the matter.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:51.480]   "Now," says the apostle, "my one great fear was this, that I myself, in any shape or form,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   should come between the people and this.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.800]   My job is to manifest the truth so I get out of the way, so that they don't see me but
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   they see it."
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.840]   He is very concerned about this.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.880]   I have reminded you already, I repeat it.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.000]   He tells them all that in that second chapter of the first epistle.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.200]   That's why, you see, when he went to Corinth, he went in weakness and in fear and much trembling.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.120]   Fancy this man, the apostle Paul.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   He was fearful.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.920]   He was in much trembling.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.560]   What was he trembling about?
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.280]   Why was he nervous?
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.760]   Was he afraid of the congregation?
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   Not at all.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.520]   He knew that he knew much more than they did.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.960]   He was an unusually able man.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.400]   A man who had been trained brilliantly as a Pharisee and had done magnificently in his
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400]   examinations.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.400]   He's a colossus.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   He's a genius.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:47.920]   And yet, he says, he was in weakness, fear, and much trembling.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.120]   What was he trembling about?
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.600]   Was he afraid that some clever fellow would get up at the end and ask a question he couldn't
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   answer?
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   You know the catch questions.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.840]   You know, there are people who go around doing that from meeting to meeting.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   Catch questions.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   "Ah, I've got him."
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   Was he trembling because of that?
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.440]   "Ah, is that man going to get up and suddenly floor me?"
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.160]   Of course he wasn't.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:13.720]   This man, by all his background and his training and his ability and his mastery of his subject
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:19.400]   as he demonstrates in these epistles, was ready to take on the whole universe.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.080]   He was afraid of nobody in that sense, so that when he went to Athens, he could face
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.600]   a congregation of Stoics and Epicureans without turning a hair, without feeling a moment's
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.760]   nervousness in and of itself over that.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.760]   He'd preach to Nero in Rome, he says.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.960]   He's ready to preach everywhere.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.800]   He's a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.680]   He's ready to stand everywhere.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   And yet, he says he's trembling.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.240]   What's he trembling about?
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:50.280]   Oh, I'm telling you, there was only one reason for his trembling.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:25:01.680]   This was his one fear, that anyhow, somehow, he himself, his personality, or what he said,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.160]   should in any way come between the people and the seeing of the truth.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.000]   His job is to manifest it, not with his other ways and means and methods, he keeps himself
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.920]   out and all the methods, manifesting the truth.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.600]   Now that, he tells these people here, was the way in which he preached this gospel.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.080]   Now then, here's the question.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.520]   Why all this?
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.840]   Why was he like this?
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:35.600]   Why has he renounced the chicanery and the trickery and the cleverness and the rhetorical
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.400]   devices that the Greek philosophers and orators indulge so much in?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   Why has he renounced it all?
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.760]   Well, here is the answer.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.480]   And it's a most important answer.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:57.800]   What the apostle tells us as the reasons of why he himself behaved in this way, are as
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:04.420]   current and as applicable tonight as they were when he first wrote them.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.200]   Why did he behave like this?
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.480]   Or let me put my question in another way.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.400]   Why should you listen to this man's message this evening?
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.240]   Because what I'm doing is nothing but this.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:27.840]   I'm simply the man working the curtain that you may hear the message of this man of God,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.880]   this message that comes with apostolic authority.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   Why should you listen to it?
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.000]   Well here are the apostle's own answers.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.200]   I would divide them into general and into particular.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.760]   Here is his first reason for behaving like this and preaching in this way, that he knows
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:57.600]   that everything that he's doing is in the sight of God.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.080]   We have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor ending the
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.840]   word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:15.040]   man's conscience, in the sight of God.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.160]   You don't understand this man until you understand that.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.960]   That was the controlling principle of his life.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.680]   That was the thing that governed everything.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.240]   It's the key to the understanding of his character and his behavior, in the sight of
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.160]   God.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.080]   That's why he didn't use any tricks.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.040]   That's why he didn't use any flattery.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.160]   That's why he didn't introduce his own ideas and adulterate the message.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.360]   He says everything I do is in the sight of God.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.560]   You know he was so concerned about this that he goes on repeating it.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.400]   We've got the same thing in the next chapter, chapter 5, in verses 10 and 11.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   Listen to him.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.280]   He said, beginning at verse 9, "Wherefore he says we labor, that whether present or
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.640]   absent we may be accepted of him.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:07.600]   For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:15.360]   the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.760]   Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.320]   unto God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.440]   You see, he was obsessed by this.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.720]   He goes on repeating it.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.280]   It's here in many places in these two great epistles.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.280]   What's it mean?
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.760]   Well, you see, what it means is this.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:45.000]   Nothing mattered to the apostle except what he was like in the sight of God.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.960]   What's it matter what men think?
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.320]   It's what God thinks that matters.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.160]   Men are here today and gone tomorrow.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.720]   They express their judgments and their opinions, but they'll soon be dead and standing before
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   God.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.640]   "Oh," says Paul, "what's the point in the value of gaining a little passing notoriety
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:11.800]   and popularity and money and fame from men who soon themselves will be moved off the
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:21.360]   scene and I and they with me will have to stand before God?"
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:28.400]   My dear friend, you know that's what makes a meeting like this unique in the world this
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   evening.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.600]   I mean like this any other Christian meeting where this gospel is being manifested.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.480]   It's altogether different from every other type and kind of meeting.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.840]   I don't want to criticize them.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.760]   I don't want to detract from their value.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.200]   It's no part of the preaching of the gospel to say that there is no value in art or in
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.400]   literature or in politics or in any one of these things.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:54.440]   All right, go to the meetings, do what you like, but all I'm saying is this, that when
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   you're here as you are at this moment and are listening to this gospel, there is this
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.280]   unique factor.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.200]   You are listening, you know, in the sight and in the presence of God.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   I don't matter.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.680]   It doesn't matter who's in this pulpit as long as he's manifesting this gospel.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.200]   You see, what matters is not how I preach nor what I say.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:28.880]   It's this, that you should realize that you are listening in the sight of God.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.560]   God is here.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.040]   God is looking upon us.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.960]   This is God's house.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.160]   Now this is the thing, says the apostle.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   There was no need to argue.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.600]   I was in no difficulties.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.360]   One thing that he knew was that the eye of God was upon him.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:53.760]   And you see, the moment a man knows that, it affects everything that he does.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.520]   How easy it is for all of us to be clever in argument and disputation, isn't it?
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.560]   And to express my views, what I think.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.360]   What I think about God and heaven and hell and about Paul and about the gospel.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   I can sit in my armchair and go in there, I and the other men, if you like, can smoke
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.860]   our pipes and we can have a wonderful discussion.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.800]   And I'm saying what I think and what I believe is right and wrong and I put the whole world
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.520]   in order and God in his place.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:28.400]   Yes, my friend, you can do that sort of thing, you know, until you realize that you are in
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.680]   the sight of God.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.920]   This man, Paul, had been putting Christ in his place, hadn't he, for years and doing
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:42.760]   it very successfully, persecuting and massacring these Christians, driving them, causing them
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   to blaspheme.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.000]   I've really thought of myself that I should do many things contrary to the name of Jesus
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   of Nazareth.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.920]   He'd been putting Christ in his place, brilliant as he was as a Pharisee and an expert in the
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.880]   law, always winning the argument, always getting the applause, the great favorite of all the
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   Jews and the Pharisees particularly, a wonderful man.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.840]   Ah, yes, he went on doing that and doing it very successfully.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840]   Until when?
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.440]   Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.740]   Until he was in the sight of the Son of God on the road to Damascus.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:29.840]   Until those eyes looked down upon him, in the sight of Christ, in the sight of God.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:35.560]   He couldn't go on with that rubbish for another second.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.800]   And my dear friend, the first thing that all of us has to do in this life, the first thing
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.160]   you've got to do, especially if you're not a Christian, is just this, is to realize that
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:54.640]   everything you do and say is done in the sight of God, the Almighty God.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.720]   Oh, if we but realized that, there'd be much less talking and cleverness and argumentation.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.080]   Do you remember poor old Job?
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.000]   Job in his trouble with the Bibles and the Elephantiasis or whatever it was, I don't
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   know.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.680]   He was scraping, scratching himself, arguing with these false friends and saying things
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.840]   about God.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:25.920]   Then God appeared to him and manifested himself to him and began to speak to him.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.520]   And Job realized that he was in the sight of God and that God's eye was upon him.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   And what does he do?
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   He tells us.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   He puts his hand upon his mouth.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.880]   Oh, what fools we are.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.840]   We speak and express our opinions and God, the Almighty, is looking down upon us.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:50.480]   My friend, you are in the sight of God.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.880]   That was why the apostle behaved as he did.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.480]   There's no room for cleverness when you know that God is watching.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.200]   There's no room for dishonesty when you know that everything you're doing is being seen.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.920]   No, no.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.840]   He did it in the sight of God.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.720]   But that's not his only reason, you know.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.800]   He says he has a second reason, and his second reason was this.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.920]   It was his concern for the Corinthians.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:23.320]   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:28.440]   You are servants for Jesus' sake.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   What's he mean?
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.040]   Well, he means this, you see.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:41.840]   He behaved like this because he'd got this living concern for the people to whom he preached.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.480]   He makes himself their servant.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.280]   He says elsewhere in the first epistle that he was the servant of all men.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:56.120]   This great man, this mighty genius, he makes himself the servant of these Corinthians and
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   all others.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.040]   And you remember the sort of people they were.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.000]   He has reminded them of that in this first epistle in the sixth chapter and in the ninth
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   verse.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   There were terrible things going on.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.520]   You know, Corinth was a seaport.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   Don't forget that.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   A cosmopolitan town.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.120]   They'd got a university incidentally, but universities don't affect the Dockland area,
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   do they?
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.720]   Neither do they affect their own area.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.400]   This was the sort of thing that happens.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.720]   "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, be not deceived.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:29.200]   Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:35.560]   with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.120]   shall inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.440]   And such were some of you.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.920]   Those are the people to whom he was preaching, but he says, "I'm your servant.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.320]   I made myself your servant."
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.640]   Why?
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:55.160]   Oh, because he was concerned about their souls.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.880]   This man had come to see the truth himself, and he knew that the truth about himself was
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.280]   the truth about all others.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.460]   He realized their position.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.440]   And he says, "I was trembling, lest in any way I might stand between you and this glorious,
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.880]   liberating truth."
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.640]   He says, "I trembled, lest I added something myself and took the edge off the gospel somewhere."
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.240]   Because, you see, if he'd started flattering them and telling them what good, fine fellows
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:25.880]   they were, and all the rest of it, they wouldn't have been convicted of their sin.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.280]   And he knew that if they were not convicted of their sin, that ultimately they wouldn't
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.480]   truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.000]   So he held nothing back.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   He didn't trim the message.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.080]   He didn't adulterate it, of course.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.560]   Many said that he was a fool.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.080]   He tells them all that in the first epistle.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.320]   He says, "I've become a fool for Christ's sake."
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.560]   They were saying, "Who is this man, this babbler?
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.920]   This man, he knows no philosophy.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.400]   Just listen to him with his simple message, 'Jesus Christ and Him crucified,' and listen
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   to what he says about us.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   He says we're all sinners."
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:00.760]   Well, that didn't trouble him at all.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.240]   You see, he wasn't out for popularity.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.800]   His business was to tell those people the truth.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.480]   For if they didn't know the truth about themselves, they'd never believe the gospel.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.120]   And the result of that would be that they would be eternally lost.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.640]   So he was very concerned for them, worked with his fear of the Lord and the judgment
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:31.440]   seat of Christ, to make him say the truth, and nothing but the truth.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.920]   The man who tells you what a good fellow you are is no friend to you, you know.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.280]   You may say he's a fine fellow.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.100]   You say, "That's the gospel I like.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.840]   Not always this sin business, not always this condemnation, not always trying to make us
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.400]   miserable, not always trying to frighten us against hell.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.440]   I want something positive and constructive.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.320]   I want a man to talk about politics and give his view on the international situation.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.520]   I want a man to tell us how good life is and how beautiful it can be made."
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.520]   Do you?
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:05.260]   Well, if you do, all I've got to say is that you're a fool.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:12.600]   What we all need to know is the truth, the facts, the plain unvarnished truth about ourselves.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   You know, Sister Paul, it was my concern for you that made me preach as I did.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.520]   I didn't want you to miss anything of it.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.920]   I wanted you to get it in detail and understand it so that your whole life might be taken
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   up by it.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.480]   You, for your sake, not only for my own sake in the sight of God, because I'm accountable
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:42.440]   for what I'm doing, but for your sake, I was cruel to be kind.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:48.120]   I probed the wound as the doctor was really concerned about his patient's health and not
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.180]   about his own popularity, that is.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.560]   It was because I was anxious that you should be healed.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   Ourselves, you are servile for Jesus' sake.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.920]   And that brings me to my last point.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:13.880]   This was the third last general reason which the great apostle had for preaching in the
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:21.200]   manner that he did, stewing the arts and the artfulness and the chicanery and the dishonesty
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:27.360]   and all the craftiness.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.640]   For Jesus' sake.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.440]   Well, you notice he goes on saying this in different ways, and we'll have to come back
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   to this.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   "We preach not ourselves."
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.240]   Well, what then?
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.520]   "Christ Jesus as Lord."
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.840]   That's the grand motive.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:57.040]   And of course, in view of this man's history, none of us should be surprised that that was
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.640]   his chiefest and his grandest motive of all.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:07.240]   Christ Jesus, the glory of Christ.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.160]   He's got it here everywhere.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.080]   He keeps on repeating it.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.440]   He says, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.960]   this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the gospel
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:30.720]   of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:37.360]   For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   This is it.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.600]   God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts."
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   What for?
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:52.400]   "In the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.320]   My dear friend, this is Christianity.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.920]   And this is the starting point.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.560]   You see, the thing that should concern every one of us this evening is not primarily whether
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:11.040]   we feel happy or miserable, not whether we feel lonely or friendly, not whether we've
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.920]   got a nice comfortable feeling in us, or whether we haven't.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.680]   I'll go further.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.360]   What should be uppermost in our minds and in our concern at this moment is not even
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:27.160]   whether there's going to be another war, nor what they're going to do with these horrible
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.840]   bombs.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   It is this, your knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:42:01.520]   And you were servants, yes, but for Jesus' sake.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   What is Paul?
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.960]   Well, he tells us at the beginning of most of his letters.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:14.440]   He starts out by saying, "Paul, the servant," which means the bond-slave, "of Jesus Christ."
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.760]   That's what he is.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:23.520]   If he's a servant of the Corinthians, he's the bond-slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.600]   He doesn't own himself.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.400]   He doesn't decide what he does.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.160]   Christ is his master in an absolute sense.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.620]   He owns him utterly and absolutely, and decides everything and all about him.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.480]   And he says, "Well, I'm a willing slave.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.920]   I'm rejoicing in it."
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:46.640]   "For Jesus' sake," says Paul, "nothing matters but that he may be made glorious and wonderful."
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.560]   Why did he feel like that?
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:55.720]   Ah, well, he felt like that, you see, for this reason, that he had very good reason
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.000]   and evidence for saying and for knowing that Jesus is Lord.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.600]   It's seen him.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.000]   You see, the most stupendous fact before us this evening is this, that the very eternal
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.760]   Son of God has been in this world of time as Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.160]   Tell me, does that make any difference to you?
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:23.400]   Is the whole of your life tonight based upon the fact that Jesus is Lord?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.720]   That that person, Jesus of Nazareth, is, as he says, the image of God, the eternal Son
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.200]   of God, and he's been in this world of time?
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.120]   Do you know that?
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:45.040]   You are interested in Julius Caesar, William the Conqueror, and all the kings and potentates,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.440]   and you know about Kaisers and Hitlers and Stalins and Mussolinis and Khrushchevs and
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.640]   statesmen, and you talk and argue so much and say how vital they are.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:02.280]   In the name of God, I ask you, what do you know about this Jesus?
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:13.960]   Jesus Christ as Lord, Lord of the universe, Lord of history, the one to whom everything
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:24.280]   belongs, to whom God has handed everything, Jesus Christ as Lord, the one who is fashioning
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.840]   and determining everything that's happening ultimately, the one who's got a plan and a
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:37.200]   program for this world and who's going to return to this world and judge it, Jesus Christ
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.040]   as Lord.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.480]   What matters but this?
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.120]   What matters how clever I am?
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.280]   What matters how ignorant I am?
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.040]   What matters how popular I am, how unpopular I am?
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.280]   What matters how much wealth I have?
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.080]   What matters the depth of my poverty?
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.480]   There's only one thing that matters.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:04.760]   It is my knowledge of him and my relationship to him.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:13.600]   Because he came into this world to save us from its calamity, and he alone can do it.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.120]   And this was the one thing that the apostle had in his mind.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.800]   And other could save anybody in Corinth or anywhere else, save this Jesus.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.840]   And he wanted them to be saved.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.380]   So why play about the bush?
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.400]   Why pretend and put on sham and try and quiddle and argue?
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.640]   Nothing matters but that men and women should be face to face with him, draw back the curtain,
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:47.680]   let them see him, the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:56.160]   The face that he'd seen himself on that Damascus road and that had broken him, smashed him,
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:04.240]   made him realize the enormity and the depth of his sinfulness and his blasphemy.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:12.960]   But oh, the most wonderful thing of all, that he whom he'd so blasphemed and reviled and
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:22.160]   persecuted should have loved him with so great a love that he not only came into the world
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:30.000]   in order to save him, but even died on the cross in his stead, the Son of God, he says,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.840]   who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:43.040]   For Jesus' sake, he died for me, he gave himself for me.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.120]   What can he be but a bumsled?
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.120]   He's only one ambition.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.880]   And that is that men and women should see him and know him and believe in him and be
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:47:02.440]   saved by him and live ever after to his glory and to his praise.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:08.760]   There was no greater thrill in the life of Paul than to look forward to a day that was
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   to come.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.160]   What's to be the supreme glory of that day?
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:18.680]   Well, he tells the Philippians in the second chapter, this is it, "That Christ, having
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.200]   made himself of no reputation, having taken the form of a man and the form of a servant,
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.880]   that he endured even the death and the shame of the cross itself.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:38.960]   Wherefore," he says, "God hath highly exalted him, that at the name of Jesus every knee
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:47.520]   should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:48:00.040]   every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, for the glory of God the Father."
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:05.360]   My friend, have you seen him?
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:11.680]   Do you know Jesus Christ as Lord, the Lord of life, the Judge at the end, the usherer
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.320]   in of the eternal kingdom, Jesus as Lord and as Savior?
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.840]   Do you know him?
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.760]   Nothing else matters but this.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:34.960]   God forbid that I or anybody else should know anything but Jesus Christ and him crucified,
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   or should ever say or do anything in any way to stand between anybody and seeing him, the
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:51.880]   Savior of your soul, the Lord of your life.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:59.520]   It is the gospel of the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.640]   Have you seen him?
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.560]   Do you know him?
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:10.360]   Have you listened to this man who saw him literally on the road to Damascus and who
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   was thereby changed from being a persecuting Pharisee into an apostle of Jesus Christ?
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.520]   Be silent, my friend.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   Stop and consider.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   Meditate.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.720]   You are in the sight of God.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.360]   Are you ready to look at him and to meet him?
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:38.840]   There is only one who can fit him to stand in the presence of God and to see him and
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:48.960]   to rejoice in him, and that is Jesus Christ, the Lord.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.520]   Amen.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
