[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.900]   All right, I think we have time for one more question here.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.660]   This one comes from Brian.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.260]   Brian says, "I'm seeking a pragmatic strategy for keeping track of things to be read
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.840]   and a process for implementation.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.600]   I have shelves of print books awaiting my good intentions as well
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.380]   as multiple folders containing hundreds of articles, papers, reports,
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.300]   and other digital content that I really want to read.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.140]   I could use help thinking about how to organize this.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.400]   Any advice on an effective systematic method for capturing, storing,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.520]   and prioritizing all the various things to be read that are in both digital and physical formats,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.400]   not to mention many great conference talks that I receive via streaming services?"
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.260]   Brian, I'm exhausted just listening to your question here.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.380]   There is a near infinite amount of material that you could consume in the world,
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.580]   and it is more accessible than it's ever been.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.260]   Well, that's good and bad.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.820]   It's good because it means that if there's something you want to master,
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.600]   you actually have access to more information on whatever that is,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.080]   and you probably would have had it any other time in history.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.240]   It's bad because you can drown.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.440]   It's just too much stuff.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.640]   So I think you are setting yourself up for frustration when you are trying to put
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.440]   in place these generic capture systems for any and all forms of interesting information.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.580]   It will always be too much.
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.160]   You will always feel behind.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.360]   You have created a necessary stress generation machine.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.780]   So what should you do instead?
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, here's my approach to the information consumption.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.720]   So adjust as needed for your situation.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   When it comes to books, as is known, I have a number of books I try to read each month.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.300]   For me, it's five, but that number could be different for you.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.700]   That creates a background rhythm of long form interaction with content.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.360]   It also naturally engenders a diversity of different types of books.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.600]   So you might have a longer book you're listening to when time gets short at the
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.640]   end of the month, sometimes I'll switch over to a shorter book and you end up
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400]   with a real variety of different types of books.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.580]   All right.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.780]   So that's how I handle books.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.200]   If I'm reading five a month, I'm being exposed to a lot of ideas.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.240]   That's enough.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.260]   I don't think about all of the books I could read.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.420]   I don't make lists of all the books I want to read.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.220]   That'd be too frustrating.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.180]   I basically say, okay, I've finished one.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.780]   What's next.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.980]   Now let's think about things like articles.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.680]   You know, as a computer scientist and a writer, I have to draw from articles.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.460]   My, my computer science papers have to draw from existing academic papers,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.880]   from writing a book chapter or a New Yorker piece, I'm probably going to
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.080]   have to pull from other types of papers, other types of things I've encountered.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.560]   There, my strategy has always been a project based pull approach,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.140]   the content assumption, consumption.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.900]   So project based.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.340]   So P B P A C C that's, that's the really natural acronym I want to see.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.740]   But what I mean by that is I allow a specific project that I'm committed
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.300]   to do and is already important.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.340]   Be the thing that pulls information into my world.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.460]   I think it's a much more consistent way to do it.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.480]   So if I am writing an article on trees in, I don't know, the rainforest
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.040]   or something like that, let that deadline and my need to read that
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.200]   article, push me to go out there and very quickly find a bunch of good
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.180]   articles on trees and read those things as quickly as possible and talk to
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.040]   some experts and learn a lot about trees that deadline, the commitment
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.740]   drew that into my life, as opposed to.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.120]   I'm just walking around one day and saying, I might like to read about trees.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.900]   Let me put in a folder somewhere, trees as a topic and have some sort of
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.520]   elaborate system that bubbles that up.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.260]   I want the projects to dictate it.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.700]   I do the same with my academic work.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.500]   Hey, I like, I want to write a paper on this.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.420]   I heard someone give a talk on it and I think I could do something here
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.860]   that motivates me to read the related work.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.500]   That's how I read related work.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.660]   When I'm trying to support a particular push towards a new result on my own.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.580]   This just hacks the motivational system in a very effective way.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.960]   It's much easier to motivate, to grab and read things when you need
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.980]   it for something you're working on.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.180]   You're going to cover a lot more material and to it, put some structure.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.920]   This gives some structure to all the information out there.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.660]   The reason why I'm reading about trees is because I'm
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.180]   writing an article about trees.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.360]   It gives you some clarity about what you should or shouldn't
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.580]   be writing about or reading.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.920]   I should say.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.580]   And then the final aspect of my system is serendipity.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.020]   You know, how do you come across ideas you never, never would have
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   known about, but might down the line generate new things.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.460]   Spark creativity, lead to a new article.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.620]   How did you find out that trees are interesting in the first place?
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.180]   Have a limited number of interesting, high quality, diverse, incoming
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.020]   information channels that you expose yourself to on a regular basis.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.080]   And let that be your entire serendipity engine.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.720]   I live in Washington, DC, for example.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.120]   So I subscribe to the paper version of the Washington Post,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.520]   a great serendipity machine.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.940]   If you're on the internet, it's all algorithmically selected
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.760]   articles to press the buttons that you're already interested in.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.480]   The paper doesn't have any algorithms.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.500]   The things that are on the front page are on the front page.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.300]   And the things on the front page of the Metro section of the
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.460]   front page of the Metro section.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.040]   It's not selected for you.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.820]   It's not more of what you already like.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.060]   And so I get exposed to a lot of interesting news locally, internationally.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.800]   That's a good engine.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.980]   Podcasts are another great engine.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.500]   You have a few podcasts you listen to that just cover interesting topics.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.940]   I mean, I can't tell you how many people I've talked to that do this
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.040]   with the podcast, 99% invisible, a lot of people do this with Planet Money.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.000]   There's a lot of podcasts like this that cover a diversity of topics.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.340]   And just, okay, I have one or two of these things I listened to, and it
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.140]   exposes you to a lot of interesting, a lot of interesting ideas.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.520]   I got a note from a lot of readers, for example, that I was referenced
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.160]   in a recent Planet Money episode, which I think just underscores that
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.080]   that is a incredibly high quality source of very important
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.840]   things you should know about.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.940]   All right.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.720]   So that's my system.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.700]   Have a set number of books you read, do that.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.080]   You're good.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.260]   For articles and other types of things, let specific projects that
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.800]   you're committed to be the thing that draws in what you're going to read
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.620]   into your life and when it comes to serendipity, fix some high quality
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.320]   serendipity channels and just expose yourself to those, do those things.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.860]   You'll be fine.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.060]   There's no reason to have an elaborate system where you have a
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.500]   thousand books you one day want to read.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.060]   There's no reason to have these folders of different types of article types
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.400]   that you're going to sort through and take one out once a week.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.740]   You're never going to do any of that.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.260]   That system's going to frustrate you.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.780]   So do something like my plan.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.540]   And I think you're going to be, have all the information you need without
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.820]   feeling like you're always falling short.
