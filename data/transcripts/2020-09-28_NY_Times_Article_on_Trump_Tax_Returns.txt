[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720]   and today on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.080]   we're going to discuss the recent New York Times study,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.840]   the president's taxes long concealed records
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.840]   show Trump's chronic losses and years of tax avoidance.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.280]   I'm gonna go through this story with you
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.640]   in an extremely detailed way.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.940]   I'm gonna give you an overview,
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.480]   tell you what's in the article, what's not in the article,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.440]   and then we'll go through it in an extremely detailed way
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.920]   so that you can get an idea of some lessons
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.840]   that you can learn and apply to your own life.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   And I'll talk to you about what's behind the scenes
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.440]   so that you can feel much more competent
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.240]   when discussing this or really any other kind of article.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.040]   This article in the New York Times
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.440]   is going to read, I guess I should say,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.960]   obviously it's gonna read differently
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.320]   depending on the political background that you come from,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   but it's gonna be read very differently
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   based upon whether you have any knowledge
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.840]   or familiarity with the tax code in general,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.280]   how taxes work in the United States,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.260]   how business works, et cetera, or if you don't.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.880]   And for that reason, it's really fascinating
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.560]   to look at people's responses to this article
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.160]   because the responses vary dramatically
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   depending on, well, I guess somebody's exposure to it.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.920]   So first, let me give you Joshua's summary of the article.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.740]   We begin with the lead.
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.080]   The New York Times obtained Donald Trump's tax information
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.980]   extending over more than two decades,
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.840]   revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.720]   an audit battle, and hundreds of millions in debt
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.000]   coming due.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.120]   In short, the New York Times obtained, evidently,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.640]   all of Trump's tax returns over the last 15 years or so,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.880]   including returns from the business organizations
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.280]   that he is involved in.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.680]   They've evidently analyzed those returns,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.560]   and they basically wanted to make a few basic statements.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.440]   Number one, there was no evidence of malfeasance uncovered
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   with regard to Russia or other kinds of basic
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.920]   allegations that have been being made.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.440]   The basic arguments that they tried to advance
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.080]   in this article are, number one,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.400]   that President Trump has lost lots and lots of money
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.240]   over the years.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.920]   And I think that's probably
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.480]   when the authors were writing it,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.200]   trying to say, "What do we talk about?"
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.380]   They were basically trying to say,
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.080]   "Well, let's prove that President Trump
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.580]   "is not a very good businessman
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.900]   "because he's lost lots of money."
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.240]   That would be number one.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.360]   With regard to potential areas of misdeeds,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.120]   they talk extensively about a few basic things.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.600]   Number one is the use of business losses
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.880]   across the organization,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.740]   including a 70-something million dollar tax deduction
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.040]   that had been claimed for and filed for
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   from an event a number of years ago.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.100]   We'll talk into that number in a little bit.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.180]   Consulting fees and also deductions,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.180]   whether the deductions are valid or not.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.040]   Now, I think for the anti-Trump crowd,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.320]   unfortunately, there's no smoking gun in the taxes.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.220]   And this is hard, it's hard to overstate
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.560]   how important this story is in political terms.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   There have been many political consultants
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.400]   who for many years have been saying,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.460]   "Well, if we could just get ahold of the tax returns,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.140]   "then we could prove all of these things
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.360]   "about President Trump's crookedness
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.760]   "and all the things that he's done wrong,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.900]   "and then we'll be able to make that case
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.280]   "as a slam dunk case."
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.800]   That does not seem to be the case,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.460]   or at least if that is the case,
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.060]   the New York Times did not choose to profile anything
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.120]   in this initial story.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.380]   As a financial planner, I read the story and I said,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.420]   "Yep, okay, that makes sense.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.840]   "Yep, that makes sense.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.180]   "No surprise there.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.220]   "Yep, that makes sense.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.580]   "That makes sense, that makes sense."
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.800]   And I'll explain all the details of how that is,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.080]   but I don't see, this is not a bombshell story
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.700]   for a financial planner.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.260]   And so I think that's one thing that's worth pointing out.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.540]   Most of the techniques and things discussed here
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.920]   is exactly what I would understand.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.840]   In fact, much of it is what I teach
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.380]   on Radical Personal Finance when I teach tax planning.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.040]   The techniques are just simply a little bit grander
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.140]   in scale than what a lot of people do,
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.200]   but there's not really any fundamental difference
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.340]   that I can see from what President Trump
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.380]   has been doing over the years
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.180]   versus what I teach people to do to save on their taxes.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.940]   So let's begin, and I'm gonna give you a detailed analysis.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.140]   And I'm doing this just so you can think about my brain
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.340]   as far as how I read articles like this.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.780]   I don't have a political horse in the race.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.940]   I'm not trying to make it go one way or the other,
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.380]   but it is really interesting to read an article like this
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.920]   and think about the challenge of writing it.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.300]   I'm not an anti-New York Times guy.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.660]   I'm not a pro-New York Times guy.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.900]   I probably read and respect newspapers
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.940]   much more than I do many other forms of news.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.740]   And I think that the authors of this story,
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.680]   Russ Buechner, Suzanne Craig, and Mike McIntyre,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.940]   it's the story of their lives, right?
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.820]   They've been working hard to get it just right,
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.700]   and you see that carefulness in the writing.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   But we'll still analyze a little bit of the details
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.980]   along the way through as well.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.440]   So begin with the lead.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.760]   Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.840]   the year he won the presidency.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.880]   In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.680]   He had paid no income taxes at all
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   in 10 of the previous 15 years,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.560]   largely because he reported losing
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.160]   much more money than he made.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.900]   As the president wages a re-election campaign
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.160]   that polls say he is in danger of losing,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.040]   his finances are under stress, beset by losses,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.160]   and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.840]   are coming due that he has personally guaranteed.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.620]   Also hanging over him is a decade-long audit battle
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.960]   with the Internal Revenue Service
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.360]   over the legitimacy of the $72.9 million tax refund
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.120]   that he claimed and received after declaring huge losses.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.760]   An adverse ruling could cost him more than $100 million.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.000]   Now, in that lead, we see these themes that I talked about.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And I'll just first give you my reactions
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.840]   to what it says here.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.200]   Most of this is designed to have a good news hook,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.280]   which is true.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.960]   And that's what a newspaper should do.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.920]   It's pretty amazing that somebody who is renowned
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.120]   and purported to be a billionaire
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.920]   would only pay $750 in income taxes.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.800]   And to the average person who doesn't understand taxes,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   that will sound like a shocking reality, a shocking number.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.680]   From my perspective, it's not particularly shocking
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.200]   due to the nature of President Trump's businesses,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   primarily involving real estate.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.000]   And real estate is one of those things
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.440]   where it's relatively, I won't say easy,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.100]   it's relatively, I should say easy,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.680]   it's relatively easy and fairly normal
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.800]   that you could invest in real estate,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.560]   use that real estate to generate
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.000]   a very significant income for yourself,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.840]   and then defer massively the tax bill,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.040]   and in some cases, completely avoid the tax bill.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.480]   Let me give you a very practical example
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.280]   about how you, perhaps not yet a billionaire,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.480]   can do the same thing in your own real estate investing.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.820]   Let's pretend that you go out
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.500]   and you're walking around your neighborhood,
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.840]   and you notice that in your neighborhood,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.640]   there is a rundown building that is for sale,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.820]   and a rundown house.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.800]   And so you go and you buy that house,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.000]   and you negotiate the purchase of that house for $150,000.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.840]   And you borrow $150,000 from your dad
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.440]   in order for you to go and be able to buy the house.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.160]   Well, when you buy that house, you buy it for a purpose,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.280]   for a purpose of being able to improve it.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.960]   So you take the money, you buy the house,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.920]   you put a little bit more money into it, and you fix it up.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.360]   And let's say that you fix it up,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.980]   so whereas now it's valuable on the marketplace,
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.040]   now it wants to be rented,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.560]   where people will want to actually live in it.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.800]   So you go and you take the house, and you rent it out.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.960]   And you rent it out for $1,500 a month.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   So now you've got an extra $1,500 a month
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.560]   of rental income coming in.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.600]   The first thing is that in that situation,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.200]   if your mortgage payment is lower than your rental income,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.660]   you'll probably have cashflow
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.120]   that'll be available to you in your pockets.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.920]   Maybe you will, maybe you won't,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.380]   but let's assume that you do.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.120]   In that situation, because of the ability
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.400]   for you to take depreciation expenses against the house,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.800]   which is unique to real estate,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.880]   you probably won't pay any money on the cash.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.820]   But what you will have done
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.600]   is you will have increased the value of the house.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.380]   So let's pretend that you put $50,000 into the house,
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.320]   you renovated it, and now it's worth $300,000.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.520]   You can now go to the bank,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.460]   and you can refinance it for $300,000 with a bank mortgage.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.820]   You take $150,000, you pay off your debt,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.480]   and you put $150,000 in your pocket.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.740]   What you've just done is you've just put $150,000
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.300]   in your pocket of real money,
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.420]   but because the money was accessed in the form of debt,
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.540]   you will not pay taxes on it.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.660]   So you just earned $150,000 tax-free.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.620]   Now, in the fullness of time,
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.500]   you will owe taxes if you sell the house.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.260]   But you can refinance the house,
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.100]   and you can take the money out in the form of debt
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.800]   and not pay any taxes on it.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.700]   Now, assuming that you keep the property rented,
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.260]   and let me change the facts just a little bit.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.100]   Let's just say that your tenant pays just enough
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.980]   for you to pay the mortgage payment
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.220]   and the expenses of the property,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.340]   the insurance, the mortgage payment, et cetera.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.540]   You will have no taxable income in that example,
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.660]   but you have $150,000 of spendable money in your pocket
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.420]   because you took it out in the form of a loan.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.260]   Now, fast forward.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.440]   Let's say that three or four years from now,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.900]   you sell that house for $300,000,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.320]   but you do a 1031 exchange into another house,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.740]   which is a like-kind exchange.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.780]   And so now you buy a bigger house,
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.940]   and you repeat the same thing.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.040]   You fix it up, then you go ahead and refinance it.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.740]   You take a mortgage out on it.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.820]   You take the mortgage to put money in your pocket.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.300]   You can do this again and again throughout your lifetime.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.100]   By doing like-kind exchanges,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.740]   you can defer the taxes indefinitely.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.380]   In theory, you could actually get the money out tax-free
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.500]   in a couple of ways.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.380]   Way number one would be in the United States,
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.500]   if it were a house that you wanted to move into,
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.960]   you could move into the house,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.980]   transform it into your personal residence,
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.220]   and then be able to take advantage of some of the increase
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.180]   due to the tax exclusion on personal residence.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.960]   That's one, some tricky rules with it, but that's one way.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.080]   A second way is you could just simply leave it
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.180]   to your children in your will at the date of your death.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.540]   And if you left them that house in your will,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.100]   maybe you started with $150,000 of seed capital,
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.140]   but at your death,
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.180]   you have a million dollars worth of real estate.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.980]   You leave that million dollars of real estate
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.220]   to your children,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.880]   assuming you're not subject to estate taxes,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.900]   which a billionaire would be,
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.420]   but you would not with a million dollars of property.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.700]   In that situation, you can now receive
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.880]   what's called a step-up in tax basis at your death.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.020]   Your children will receive the million dollars,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.920]   and the entire gain from $150,000 to a million dollars
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.660]   would have been untaxed in the tax code.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.580]   Meanwhile, you access that money
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.860]   in the form of mortgage loans,
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.420]   you put cash in your pocket,
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.780]   and that allowed you to spend money.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.180]   Now, that's not even getting into a deep discussion
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.500]   of depreciation expense,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.060]   which is very significant
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.820]   when you are dealing with a property portfolio
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.360]   like President Trump supervises.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.420]   That's just a simple, ordinary example
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.040]   to show how real estate, because of its very nature,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.980]   lends itself to a tremendous level of tax efficiency.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.460]   It's very, very useful from a tax efficiency perspective.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.420]   The other thing that I immediately wonder is,
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.940]   okay, he paid no income taxes at all
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.380]   in 10 of the previous 15 years.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.300]   My question is immediately,
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.340]   well, what did he pay in the five of the 15?
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.440]   And this has to do with the lumpiness of income.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.540]   We'll talk about this in a moment
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.500]   when we get into the details,
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.180]   but when you're doing tax planning,
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.100]   what you generally often want to do
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.500]   is you want to lump your income
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.900]   and you wanna lump your deductions
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.460]   and your expenses together.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.900]   And so, a simple example.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.940]   You can, charitable deductions,
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.780]   in the United States,
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.260]   if you're gonna take itemized deductions on your taxes,
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.220]   and I understand I'm not starting at beginner level,
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.380]   I'm assuming you understand the difference
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.740]   between a standard deduction and an itemized deduction.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.700]   But most people don't have enough itemized deductions
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.120]   for it to be worth it for them to itemize their deductions,
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.700]   but there are a lot of things that you can do.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.100]   So what you do if you're trying to maximize
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.660]   your tax savings is one year you take the standard deduction
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.820]   and then the next year you itemize deductions
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.100]   and you lump your charitable deductions together
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.140]   in that second year so you get bigger deductions.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.140]   And so that's a simple kind of layman's example
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.740]   of why lumpy income and lumpy deductions are useful.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.460]   You do the same thing in business when possible.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.340]   If you can compress your income together,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.100]   you try to adjust the timing of your income
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.340]   to match the time when you have
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.240]   significant deductions available.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.400]   So a lead like this is a good journalistic lead,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.020]   it's factually true,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.880]   but it's one of those things where you have big questions
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.580]   and you wanna know immediately as a financial advisor,
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.760]   what happened in those five years?
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.600]   One of the most interesting things that's mentioned here,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.900]   which I'll talk about in detail,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.820]   is this comment they made,
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.740]   also hanging over him as a decade long audit battle
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.060]   with the Internal Revenue Service
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.540]   over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.540]   And I immediately wanna know, why so long?
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.300]   Why do you have a decade long audit battle?
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.120]   That's a really long audit battle.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.460]   So that tells me a couple of things right off the bat,
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.340]   even if we don't get to the details.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.020]   That tells me, number one,
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.720]   if this is a decade long audit battle,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.900]   this is not a clear cut win or loss either way.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.060]   This is not a clear cut thing where,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.040]   oh, the IRS was in the wrong
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.340]   and the taxpayer just said, yeah,
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.280]   well, the IRS was in the wrong,
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.820]   the IRS admitted it and the taxpayer got it their way.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.620]   On the other hand, it wasn't a clear cut thing
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.780]   where the IRS could move against them and say,
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.280]   look, you're clearly wrong in this situation.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.180]   Now, we find out later in the article
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.580]   that there's some more texture to this,
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.420]   probably due to President Trump's political status,
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.620]   but a decade long audit battle means
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.340]   that this is not a smoking gun in some way.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.260]   Now, obviously I can't read the whole article to you
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.240]   'cause of the New York Times copyright restrictions,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.260]   but I will read just some important points to you.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.380]   The New York Times has obtained tax return data
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.660]   extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.780]   and the hundreds of companies
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.780]   that make up his business organization,
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.340]   including detailed information
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.340]   from his first two years in office.
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.900]   It does not include his personal returns
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.900]   for 2018 or 2019.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.560]   This is certainly one of those ethical gray issues.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.480]   You clearly have a leaker, somebody in very well-connected,
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.780]   I don't know, I'm not competent enough to say
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.100]   where is this person probably from,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.740]   but clearly you had someone who had access to this data
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.020]   who chose to share it with the New York Times.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.060]   That's probably some form of crime.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.220]   I don't know the details on it,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.500]   but that's probably some form of crime.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.020]   Now, is it a matter of public interest
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.800]   for the New York Times to publish it?
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.660]   I would say probably so.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.020]   And should there be a law requiring
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.540]   the disclosure of this data?
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.640]   Maybe there should be, but there's not a law right now.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.140]   So although that's been the custom,
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.640]   there's not a law right now.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.100]   It is important to note, and quote,
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.780]   "They report the data reports that Mr. Trump
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.100]   "owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets,
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.020]   "but they do not reveal his true wealth,"
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.420]   as is the nature with any kind of tax return.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.580]   Taxes do not indicate wealth.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:49.580]   Taxes and tax returns indicate merely your income.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.980]   That's what's included in a tax return.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.900]   Now, where you can get a better idea
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.740]   of a politician's wealth is by looking
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.220]   at their financial disclosure reports,
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.760]   where they report ranges of assets, ranges of debts.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.060]   For example, we know how much money
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.300]   President Trump is liable for.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.540]   We know all the people that he owes money to.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.880]   But tax returns do not indicate wealth,
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.420]   which will be a common theme that, as I explained to you,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.140]   the concepts that I can grasp from this article
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.880]   and how you can use this to lower your tax bill,
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.100]   you have to always recognize
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.220]   that income is not necessarily wealth.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:29.140]   In response to a letter summarizing
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.540]   the Times findings, Alan Garten,
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.940]   a lawyer for the Trump Organization,
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.860]   said that most, if not all, of the facts
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.220]   appear to be inaccurate and requested
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.620]   the documents on which they were based.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.500]   After the Times declined to provide the records
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.940]   in order to protect its sources,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.220]   Mr. Garten took issue only with the amount
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.220]   of taxes Mr. Trump had paid.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.980]   Over the past decade, President Trump has paid
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.940]   tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.020]   to the federal government,
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.900]   including paying millions in personal taxes
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.220]   since announcing his candidacy in 2015.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.040]   With the term personal taxes, however,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.400]   Mr. Garten appears to be conflating income taxes
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.140]   with other federal taxes Mr. Trump has paid,
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.340]   Social Security, Medicare,
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.780]   and taxes for his household employee.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.660]   I wanna talk for a moment about taxes
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.980]   because when we use the term,
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.280]   it's a very general term,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.260]   but it's important that you think about
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.380]   and that you recognize and pay attention
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.380]   to the fact that you understand how taxes work
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.900]   because if you understand how taxes work
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.500]   and how income is taxed,
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.840]   then all of this stuff will make a lot more sense.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.060]   First of all, what's being discussed here
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.020]   in this article is federal income taxes,
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.500]   federal income taxes exclusively.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.660]   That ignores a whole lot of money
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.580]   that flows to the federal government
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.460]   that's not being discussed in this article.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.660]   So the New York Times here identifies it.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.460]   Other federal taxes, including Social Security,
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.600]   Medicare, and taxes for his household employees.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.020]   I would say if far in addition to that,
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.940]   you have significant numbers of taxes
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.040]   that are paid even for employees.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.660]   So for example, let's say that I own
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.860]   the Sheets organization, not the Trump organization,
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.420]   I own the Sheets organization.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.180]   And the Sheets organization has a million dollars of revenue
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.020]   and we have 100 employees.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.220]   Well, that organization in and of itself
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.120]   is responsible for paying massive amounts of taxes,
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.620]   massive amounts of federal taxes.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.260]   Also, the employees are all paying federal taxes
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.460]   based upon the productivity of the organization.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.940]   So while at the end of the day,
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.060]   I might have a $0 tax bill,
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.660]   that's not to say that the Sheets organization
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.420]   is in and of itself a net consumer
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.940]   of things like federal money.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.660]   If you look at the tax impact of a company,
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.980]   for example, famously Amazon is often touted as,
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.420]   Amazon doesn't pay any taxes.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.640]   Is it true?
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.220]   Depends on how you look at it, right?
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.840]   On one hand, yeah, it is true.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.680]   On the other hand, the tax impact of a company
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.220]   is very, very significant.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.540]   And most of the stuff that is discussed here
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:59.460]   in a story like this is in some ways
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.700]   a sleight of hand because everything that's discussed
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.980]   is simply the basic nature of the tax code.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.140]   The tax code is designed to incentivize investment.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.620]   The tax code is designed to protect businesses
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.640]   from losses of income.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.820]   It's designed to make it palatable for businessmen
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.460]   to invest money and grow businesses
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.520]   because of what's considered to be the good,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.380]   the net positive good, the net effect of an organization
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.380]   that's productive in that way.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.700]   Now, before we get to more of the details,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.320]   I wanna make one basic point.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.940]   The first argument that this article is making
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.580]   is primarily this idea that President Trump's
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.480]   business success is a mirage.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.660]   That's what the editors or the writers are trying to say.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.080]   They're trying to say that his business success is a mirage.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.700]   I think there are ways that you can fairly
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.180]   make that argument.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.420]   There'll be people who say, well, he just inherited
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.220]   all kinds of money from his parents and his father.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.660]   He would've done better if he put in an index fund.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.700]   I'm not sure.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.740]   But what I wanna point out is actually,
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.420]   from a business guy's perspective,
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.220]   what I see is I don't see a mirage.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.220]   I see, forgive me, a touch of genius in the sense that
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.720]   the exact things that you see, the New York Times article,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.180]   within the article, the exact things that you see
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.620]   the article talk about how these are wrong things,
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.120]   it actually has paid off in spades for Trump
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.300]   in the creation of his image.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.960]   So let me read the article, what the editors say here,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.740]   and then we'll discuss this lesson.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.580]   Together with related financial documents
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.140]   and legal filings, the records offer the most detailed
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.140]   look yet inside the president's business empire.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.040]   They reveal the hollowness, but also the wizardry
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.260]   behind the self-made billionaire image,
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.540]   honed through his star turn on The Apprentice,
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.380]   that helped propel him to the White House
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.980]   and that still undergirds the loyalty of many in his base.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.780]   Ultimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.680]   playing a business mogul than being one in real life.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.660]   Listen very carefully to that sentence.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.900]   Ultimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.060]   playing a business mogul than being one in real life.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.460]   Now listen to the very next sentence.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.180]   The Apprentice, along with the licensing
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.100]   and endorsement deals that flowed
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.260]   from his expanding celebrity, brought Mr. Trump
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.940]   a total of $427.4 million,
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.880]   the Times analysis of the records found.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.740]   When I read that, and I'll give you some other evidence
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.860]   and quotes throughout the article, I thought to myself,
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.860]   how can you write that he's been more successful
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.680]   in playing a business mogul than being one in real life,
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.900]   when in the very next sentence you say
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.900]   that he made $427.4 million from his work on The Apprentice?
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.740]   Now The Apprentice is an interesting part
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.740]   of President Trump's business structure,
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.660]   because it's the part at which he's been
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.260]   the most heavily taxed, due to it not being real estate.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.740]   And that's an important point when we get
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.320]   to the actual numbers of the taxes he's paid.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.180]   You have to understand that The Apprentice,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.180]   while I think was a fabulously successful endeavor for him,
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.320]   he made a lot of money, he built a massive reputation,
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.020]   he was able to cultivate an image of himself
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.360]   as being this super hot shot businessman from it,
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.460]   it was extremely highly taxed,
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.860]   due to it not being real estate.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.420]   But I'm a bit cynical, and I just thought to myself,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.540]   the editors of this article, the writers here,
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.740]   the three writers of this article
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.780]   and the teams of people supporting them,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.300]   I don't know, 'cause I don't know anything about them,
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.220]   but I would guess that they probably make,
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.420]   you would think probably an average income
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.600]   would be somewhere in the, $150,000-ish.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.780]   It wouldn't surprise me if that was a standard income.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.620]   Maybe if these are very senior reporters
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.980]   with The New York Times, maybe they're making $250,000.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.900]   Somewhere in that range of $150,000-$300,000
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.800]   would be my guess of what a writer at The New York Times
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.860]   would probably make in this kind of context.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.300]   Which means that the total lifetime earnings of that someone,
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.980]   depending on how old they are and how senior they are,
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.940]   total lifetime earnings of somebody in that situation
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.140]   would be, I would guess, $3-6 million,
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.420]   if you were sitting down and calculating
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.580]   all of their lifetime earnings
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.560]   from getting a journalism degree
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.380]   and then winding up going on to working through
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.380]   maybe a normal retirement age at age 65.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.820]   It'd probably be $3-6 million, something in that range.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.020]   It's quite interesting to have somebody
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.860]   with a lifetime income of, say, $3-6 million write,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.020]   "Ultimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.860]   "playing a business mogul than being one in real life.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.460]   "The Apprentice, along with the licensing
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.700]   "and endorsement deals that flowed
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.120]   "from his expanding celebrity,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.460]   "brought Mr. Trump a total of $427.4 million."
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.500]   I would very much like to earn $427.4 million
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.720]   in five to 10 years.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.920]   I would very much like to earn $427.4 million
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.660]   in my lifetime.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.960]   When you recognize that that is a small component
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   of the taxpayer in question and his overall financial life,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.020]   it's very hard to make that argument in it
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.600]   with a straight face.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.120]   I think one of the most valuable things
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.120]   about what I have learned from Mr. Trump's business life
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.720]   is just the truth of the old saying
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.520]   that perception is reality.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.560]   Years ago, I worked with a guy
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.960]   who hammered this into my head.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.720]   And the guy was, he wasn't a fraud,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.000]   but he was a boss of mine that lived by the phrase
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.720]   that perception is reality.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.100]   And that's always been hard for me
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.240]   because I've always been a reality matters guy.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.200]   I've never been a smoke and mirrors guy
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.400]   and a perception guy.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.320]   I've always been a reality matters guy.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.920]   But one of the things that you see with President Trump,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   he is shameless, absolutely shameless in saying,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.280]   this is the image that I'm going to project.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.720]   And as I project this image, people will now believe it.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.440]   People are going to believe it again and again and again.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.880]   And I'll show you throughout this article
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.160]   as we go through it linearly,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.520]   I'll show you how this comes out to be true.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.320]   But one of the things that Mr. Trump is a master of
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.520]   is saying, I'm gonna see something,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.360]   I'm gonna create this vision of something,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.880]   and then I'm gonna speak this vision so clearly
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.480]   that he personally seems to believe it at its heart.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.000]   And then it brings people along with it, along with him.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.120]   And so when Trump says, Trump is a luxury brand
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.280]   and we're gonna be the luxury brand,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   he essentially willed it into existence.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.080]   And he did the same thing with The Apprentice.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.000]   He basically had this idea that I'm gonna play
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.280]   this hotshot business guy role.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.240]   And he willed this reality into existence
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.480]   and made a whole lot of money along the way.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.520]   Now what I see immediately,
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.200]   let me read the whole paragraph to you.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.760]   The Apprentice, along with the licensing
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.160]   and endorsement deals that flowed
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.840]   from his expanding celebrity,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.720]   brought Mr. Trump a total of $427.4 million,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.880]   the Times analysis of the records found.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.040]   He invested much of that in a collection of businesses,
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.720]   mostly golf courses, that in the years since
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.600]   have steadily devoured cash,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.680]   much as the money he secretly received from his father
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.120]   financed a spree of quixotic overspending
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.720]   that led to his collapse in the early 1990s.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.040]   Now, as a financial planner,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.800]   I wrote in my marking up of this article,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.840]   when it says he invested much of that
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.960]   in a collection of businesses, mostly golf courses,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   that in the years since have steadily devoured cash
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.920]   and created tax deductions, much as the money received.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.080]   The whole point, when any person creates
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.520]   a lot of earned income,
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.200]   what you immediately have to do is you have to figure out
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.480]   how can I shelter that income?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.520]   And that's one of the perspectives that I would bring
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.720]   to this kind of analysis of financial planner
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.360]   that would be different from the New York Times writers,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.120]   is that when you create income,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.600]   you immediately need to look and say,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.080]   how can I shelter this?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.920]   What can I do?
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.560]   Because the single biggest expense that you're going to face
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.200]   is when you create income is the tax man.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.360]   The tax rates on earned income are stunningly horrific,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.240]   approaching and exceeding 50%,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.640]   depending on where you are in the United States,
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.240]   depending on your federal tax rates,
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.040]   depending on your state tax rates, et cetera.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.560]   And so it's very, very problematic.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.280]   And in a situation like the apprentice,
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.560]   although he could still try to massage the earnings
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.000]   and say, well, I need to figure out
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.160]   how to protect some of this,
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.000]   and maybe it's not all gonna be classified
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.440]   as earned income, it's hard.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.280]   Because that kind of money is very, very heavily taxed,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.040]   and you don't have a lot of good deductions
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.400]   associated with it.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.520]   And so what somebody who's trying to save on tax will do
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.000]   is immediately go and look for businesses
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.960]   that will generate growth that's not tax,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.800]   which is primarily gonna be capital gains growth
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.160]   rather than current income,
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.440]   and that are gonna create lifestyle opportunities,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.200]   and that are gonna enhance the brand.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.320]   And so to me, this sounds totally normal.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.160]   It's the same advice
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.600]   that your accountant would give you, right?
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.040]   Let's say that you run a small business,
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.640]   maybe you make $200,000 a year.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.680]   And at the end of the year,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.120]   you're going and you're meeting with your accountant
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.040]   on December 1st, and the accountant is saying to you,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.320]   all right, listen, buddy, you made 200 grand this year,
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.240]   you're gonna pay 50 grand or 70 grand or something of taxes,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.320]   can you spend some money?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   Is there something that you can spend money on?
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.840]   The first thing that you look for in that situation is,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.240]   can I spend money profitably?
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.720]   And so you look for something like buying equipment,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.120]   maybe your business could use an expansion,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.520]   and if you expanded something beyond where you are now,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.840]   you could make more money in the future,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.720]   but that would wipe out 50 grand of profit.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.920]   So you look, can I invest money profitably?
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.160]   You look at, can I invest money early?
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.760]   Can I move expenses forward into something
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.920]   that I would do later, but I don't know.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.140]   And so the classic is marketing expenses.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.320]   You look and say, well, our marketing budget
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.920]   for the next fiscal year is going to be $50,000,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.560]   but can I just prepay that right at the end of the year
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.760]   and go ahead and prepay those marketing expenses
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.480]   so I save on the taxes?
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.360]   You might look and say,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.280]   can I invest this money into Goodwill?
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.120]   Can I give a small bonus to my employees?
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.840]   Or can I hire another employee?
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.980]   Once you reach a certain point in the tax rate,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.000]   you basically start hiring employees
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.680]   simply to enhance your lifestyle.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.500]   You look at it and you say,
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.480]   the government's gonna steal half of this anyway,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.720]   so why don't I just go ahead and hire an employee
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.200]   who makes my life easier?
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.760]   Someone who, even if they do relatively unproductive things,
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.080]   just gives you a better lifestyle.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.880]   I'm gonna hire a personal assistant
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.720]   whose job is to fix me drinks
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   and bring me lunch in the office.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.400]   I'm using a bit of a hyperbolic example,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.060]   but you reach a point where you say,
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.400]   I'm just gonna invest it into something
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.100]   that may not truly be necessary
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.720]   because the tax cut is so steep.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.240]   Or you look and say,
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.040]   is there a way that I can enhance my lifestyle
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.040]   with a big purchase?
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.320]   And so the common kind of relatively small
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.800]   business approach to this is,
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.060]   well, we had $200,000, so I went ahead and bought a car,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.720]   or I went ahead and bought a new truck for the business.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.000]   I didn't need one.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.640]   I could have made the old one go,
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.120]   but I was gonna spend all this money at the taxman anyway,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.880]   so I went ahead and bought a nicer truck.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.120]   Well, that's the small business approach
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.840]   to this kind of planning.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.640]   I would bet you that the billionaire business
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.560]   approach to this, if you were inside Donald Trump's brain,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.040]   that you would just say,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.920]   I'm gonna buy another golf course, right?
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.760]   Because what do you do?
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.960]   What benefit do you get when you buy a golf course?
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.920]   Well, first of all, you're enhancing your global brand,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.240]   right, you're building this brand of being a luxury,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.380]   a purveyor of luxury goods, luxury lifestyles.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.280]   When you're investing in a golf course,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.320]   you're buying a massive quantity of hard assets.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.220]   You're buying a massive quantity of land.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.160]   Oftentimes it's land that is extraordinarily valuable
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.760]   in a valuable location sometimes,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.800]   but that land only has, usually,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.780]   a relatively small number of buildings on it, right?
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.960]   You've got a clubhouse, you might have some condos
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.460]   or something associated with that,
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.760]   but it's nothing like buying a skyscraper.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.200]   So you're buying a bunch of land,
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.880]   you're buying a clubhouse,
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.800]   you have a relatively small staff
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.760]   compared to the overall investment,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.120]   but you have a probably,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.780]   and I don't know anything about the golf business,
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.720]   I'm just analyzing it,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.200]   I've never even been part of a golf club,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.120]   I'm just looking at it from the outside and saying,
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.100]   you have probably relatively low expenses
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.840]   compared to the potential.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.800]   I used to drive past in West Palm Beach,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.280]   the Trump Golf, whatever it's called,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.400]   in West Palm Beach, the big golf resort that he has there.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.840]   I mean, the membership fees on a business like that
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.440]   are obscene, it's, I think,
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.080]   probably about $300,000 to join the club,
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.680]   plus you have all the other fees,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.200]   but yet to service that is relatively simple.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.760]   You have a staff of groundskeepers,
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.080]   you have a basic maintenance staff for the buildings,
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.480]   you have a hospitality staff.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.360]   It's not a very complex business,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.600]   but it can be very profitable if you have that image,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.240]   if you have a nice place, et cetera.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.280]   But from a tax perspective,
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.940]   this is a really good use of business
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.360]   because you're acquiring a hard asset like land
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.340]   that doesn't have a lot of maintenance costs
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.640]   associated with it that generates income,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.200]   and then you can hold that land for a long time,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.400]   plus it gives you a great lifestyle.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.500]   You always have to say to your buddies,
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.600]   hey, listen, we'll go to my club,
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.380]   and you get to hobnob with it,
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.240]   and it creates this incredible network for you,
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.740]   build a network for yourself.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.220]   In a minute, I'll tell you the story
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.760]   of when President Trump started Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.400]   and kind of the gossip about it on Palm Beach at the time.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.500]   But to me, that just sounds to me
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.360]   like a lifestyle tax deduction.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.480]   So I compare it to say,
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.660]   is it true that he is losing money on it?
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.620]   Sure, right?
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.040]   There's no reason to say that,
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.180]   but not all losses are equal in the same way
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.580]   that if at the end of the year,
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.480]   you go out and you decide to put money into your business
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.860]   and buy a nicer car,
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.440]   that might turn one of your businesses
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.220]   into a loss for the year,
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.580]   but in your mind, you're still happy to drive the car.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.980]   We'll talk more about multiple businesses in a moment.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.820]   So goes on, talks about the legal battles,
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.100]   and the New York Times says this.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.780]   In fact, those public filings,
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.340]   referring to the public disclosure requirements,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.180]   those public filings offer a distorted picture
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.540]   of his financial state,
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.440]   since they simply report revenue, not profit.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.900]   In 2018, for example,
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.540]   Mr. Trump announced in his disclosure
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.080]   that he had made at least $434.9 million.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.280]   The tax records deliver a very different portrait
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.740]   of his bottom line, $47.4 million in losses.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.460]   Now, the lesson here that you always need to remember
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.420]   is first of all,
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.540]   you need to always remember
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.700]   there's a difference between revenue and profit,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.800]   but there are two kinds of profit, right?
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.620]   There's paper profit, and there's real profit, right?
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.620]   In the same way that there's losses and there's paper losses.
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.460]   And what I tried to explain with the example of the car
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.140]   is that you might very well have a business
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.940]   that loses money, and it's not a lie.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.380]   It genuinely loses money.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.280]   You genuinely spent more money than the business brought in,
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:55.580]   but you may do that purposely for any number of reasons.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.380]   And an article like this doesn't tell us.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.540]   Now, I'm not trying in this analysis to defend
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.060]   and say, well, actually,
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.540]   the New York Times is totally wrong.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.540]   And actually what's happening
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.700]   is that President Trump is making $8.7 billion,
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.340]   and he's just got the world's best tax attorney.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.180]   I'm not making that claim at all.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.600]   What I'm saying is that articles like this,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.940]   they're not very persuasive one way or the other,
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.860]   which is why what you see in the political sphere
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.660]   is you see each camp is basically saying,
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.340]   hey, this is what I believe, this is what I believe,
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.260]   and people go in different ways.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.860]   And so I wanna explain the concepts,
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.260]   the financial concepts to you so you can consider.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.540]   When the New York Times writes here,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.580]   "The tax records deliver a very different portrait
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.700]   "of his bottom line, $47.4 million of losses."
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.260]   What we don't know is are those losses on paper,
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:45.100]   meaning they are accounting for depreciation expense?
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.940]   Are they accounting for financing expense?
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.680]   Or are those losses real losses
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.820]   that are actually sucking cash out of your pocket,
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.140]   and it's actually a real loss?
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.740]   And let me illustrate this with an example.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.980]   Back to my real estate example.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.520]   You bought the house for $150,000.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.620]   You improved the value of the house
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.700]   with some renovation money.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.420]   Then you refinanced the house for $300,000.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.380]   You thus, because you refinanced it,
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.140]   you put $150,000 of tax-free money in your pocket.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.300]   But that $150,000 of tax-free money is not income, it's debt.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.660]   So now you have $300,000 of debt on your $300,000 property.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.940]   And then a hurricane blows in,
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.060]   or a coronavirus pandemic hits,
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.980]   and now your tenant doesn't pay you any money
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.580]   for an entire year.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.180]   Well, now you're going to have significant losses
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.180]   to report on that property.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.980]   You're going to have $1,500 a month of a mortgage payment
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   that you're paying.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.040]   So there's $18,000 of loss right there.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.540]   Plus you're gonna have other expenses.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.700]   You're gonna have property expenses.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.140]   You might've had to fix up the property
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.580]   or do some repairs along the way
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.220]   while that tenant was living in there.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.520]   You might have some legal expenses for that property.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.500]   Plus you'll have some depreciation expenses.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.140]   And then you might have some accounting expenses
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.660]   and some other things related to the property.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.620]   So it's very conceivable that in that simple example,
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:14.420]   you lost $25,000 in 2020
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.020]   based upon that $150,000 property that you bought.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.420]   But your bank account can tell a very different story
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.940]   because your bank account,
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.320]   while you may have lost $25,000 on your tax returns,
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.740]   your bank account has an extra $125,000 in it
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.900]   at the end of the year
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.420]   that it didn't have at the beginning of the year
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:36.260]   because you took out that $125,000 in the form of debt.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.140]   And that's one of the things
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.180]   that makes a real estate empire so difficult
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.740]   to poke your way through from a tax perspective
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.900]   is the use of debt.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.700]   Because real estate is so leverageable,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.380]   you'll have most real estate investors
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.300]   constantly moving their debt around.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.500]   And they'll take the mortgages,
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.340]   they'll move them over here,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.020]   they'll refinance there, refinance there.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.460]   And if you have good properties
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.460]   that are increasing in value,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.760]   you can do that throughout an entire lifetime.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.660]   And I'm not exaggerating,
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.380]   you can do that for an entire lifetime.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.360]   But that would just be a simple example to say
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.540]   that the tax records saying that in 2018,
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.700]   he made $434.9 million
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.340]   and he had $47.4 million in losses
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.120]   actually tells us nothing
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.620]   about the real profitability of his business.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.920]   Now, let me enhance my house example
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.140]   to illustrate this point still further.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.020]   You bought the house for $150,000,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.980]   you improved it,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.340]   you brought the appraisal value up to $300,000,
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.780]   you refinanced it for $300,000.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.660]   But then in that year
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.340]   when your tenant didn't pay you anything
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.520]   and yet you had to pay those mortgage payments
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.360]   every single year,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.520]   thus you're losing in my example, $30,000.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.760]   In that year,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.940]   a developer moved in next door
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.020]   and bought out all of the other houses
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.760]   and started this new big, beautiful gulf development.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.540]   And now that's increased the value
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.820]   of your property even more.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.740]   I know we're getting some good increases here,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.020]   but it serves to illustrate the accounting point
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.540]   that I need you to understand.
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.740]   You've increased the value of your property now
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.060]   and it's actually $500,000.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:10.060]   So not only do you have an extra $125,000 in your pocket,
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.060]   but on your balance sheet,
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.020]   you can fairly reflect
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.140]   that that property is now worth $500,000.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.900]   So you have cash to spend from the mortgage
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.380]   and you have unrealized appreciation
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.260]   in the value of your portfolio.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.140]   And that unrealized appreciation
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.100]   is the most valuable tool in an investor's portfolio
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.580]   for avoiding tax.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.820]   Because that unrealized appreciation
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.460]   is actually spendable money,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.600]   especially if you get it out with a mortgage,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.180]   and you can defer that tax
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.940]   through a like-kind exchange with real property.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.160]   So you can now take that property that's worth $500,000,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.660]   you've already taken $125,000 of money in your pocket
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.900]   because you refinanced it at 300.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   Now you can sell it to the developer for $500,000.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.900]   You can go and you can buy another property
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.460]   somewhere else for $500,000.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.500]   And on that one, you can put a $500,000 mortgage on it.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.460]   And now you have 200 and what did I do?
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.780]   $325,000 in your pocket over and above what you've done.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.560]   And not a penny of it has ever been taxed
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.980]   because you have unrealized appreciation.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.060]   And then again, you can defer that appreciation
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.780]   for a very long time because you control when you sell.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.540]   So this also comes into the lumping of income.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.460]   What does an investor do?
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.940]   An investor looks at when they create income.
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.020]   And what you wanna do is you want to bring your losses
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.820]   and you wanna realize your losses on your assets
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.880]   when you can pay, when you have income
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.220]   that you can't otherwise avoid or otherwise offset.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.260]   So let's continue on.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.260]   Tax records do not have the specificity
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.300]   to evaluate the legitimacy of every business expense
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.460]   Mr. Trump claims to reduce his taxable income.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.780]   For instance, without any explanation in his returns,
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.420]   general and administrative expenses, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.820]   But the returns by his own account
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.940]   undercut his claims of financial acumen,
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.940]   showing that he is simply pouring more money
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.260]   into many businesses than he is taking out.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.440]   Now, what I would say is that this is one
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.140]   of those statements that is one of those things
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.000]   that's very true, but you can't actually know
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.180]   even from the tax returns because of what I just tried
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.300]   to discuss about the unrealized appreciation.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:26.300]   If Mr. Trump were realizing income, then he would owe tax.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:32.340]   But it's the fact that he's not realizing income,
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.620]   that's why he doesn't owe tax.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.500]   That's why his, allegedly, his tax return,
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.500]   his debt, his total tax due was $750
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.880]   because he's not realizing income.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   Now, if President Trump had simply taken his $400,000 salary
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.240]   and instead of donating it to charity,
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.040]   which is getting him now $400,000 of additional deductions
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.440]   that he can use, if instead of taking that,
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.240]   he simply took it and put it in the bank,
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.800]   now he would owe income tax on the $400,000
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.960]   and being a resident of, I assume he's taxed
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.140]   as a resident of Washington, D.C.,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.340]   although his official residency, I think, is in Florida,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.200]   but he would owe, what, $170,000, say,
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.760]   on that $400,000 of tax, $140,000 to $170,000,
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.280]   something in there.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.340]   So now, of course, everything would change immediately,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.320]   but he's not doing that.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.280]   And here's the next thing that you need to understand.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.100]   Once you are wealthy, you can live very, very well,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.040]   and you can increase your wealth without paying tax,
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.160]   especially if you've invested into businesses
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.280]   that are providing you with lifestyle benefits
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.640]   associated with them.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.880]   Now, there are many aspects of this
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.760]   that are clear in the IRS tax laws.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.800]   There are many components of this that are genuinely clear.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.200]   You know, for example, you can't say,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.400]   this is my business and I've got to get
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.160]   all these personal benefits out of it.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.940]   But if you think about a business
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.480]   like Mr. Trump is involved in,
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.440]   as far as his businesses, hotels and golf courses, et cetera,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.040]   virtually everything that he does
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.000]   in terms of all of his personal expenses
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.640]   are legitimately ordinary and necessary business expenses.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   If you have a hotel and you spend a night in the hotel,
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.520]   you don't have to count that night in the hotel
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.720]   as far as saying, well, look,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.480]   this night in the hotel is a personal expense
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.080]   because I don't normally do that.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.720]   That is very defensible as simply saying,
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.640]   it's a quality control mechanism.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.520]   I own a hotel business.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.360]   There's a reason why corporations have corporate suites
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.240]   all around the world, or corporate apartments,
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.720]   where when our employees are in that city,
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.680]   we go and stay in that corporate apartment.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   And so when you recognize the fact that I own a private club,
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.280]   that I also have private rooms at, I own hotels,
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.080]   I have an airplane to manage my affairs,
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.520]   I do business on the airplane,
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.360]   virtually everything that someone like President Trump does,
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.520]   virtually everything like that
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   is either a genuine part of the business,
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.720]   is a genuine business expense,
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.000]   or it's simply a de minimis fringe benefit.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.440]   If you go and you take a meal at your hotel
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.240]   and that meal has a value of $50,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.720]   but you technically didn't perform business at that meal,
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.480]   you technically sat there by yourself and you ate it,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.240]   well, technically speaking, that's one of those things
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.560]   where is that a personal expense
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.200]   or is that a business expense?
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.720]   Well, in a situation like this,
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.800]   when you have a life that has that many people
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.880]   involved in it, every meal you take
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.680]   is gonna have somebody with you
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.640]   doing some kind of business deal, researching something,
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.000]   and a $50 meal or a bottle of champagne
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   that you order up from your hotel,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.960]   that's just de minimis stuff that disappears.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.200]   In the same way that the local landscaping guy,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.040]   when he drives his landscaping truck
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.000]   to the grocery store to get groceries,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.560]   technically he's responsible now to the IRS
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   for three miles of personal use of the vehicle,
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.600]   and he should account for that,
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.320]   and at the end of the year, he should just deduct
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   that $1.65 of personal use of the vehicle
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.320]   because he was using a business vehicle
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.120]   for a personal vehicle.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.040]   Come on, right?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.560]   It's impossible to prove that stuff.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.280]   That stuff disappears in the wash,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.880]   even though the law is clear
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.840]   on what is personal use of a vehicle and what's not.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.120]   So in this situation, these arguments,
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.480]   while I believe that probably the New York Times is right,
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.320]   'cause I think that how I'd guess this worked
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.200]   if I were a reporter, I would take it,
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.600]   then I would hire a bunch of tax attorneys,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.240]   accountants, et cetera, and I would say,
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.760]   help me digest this stuff and help explain it to me
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.320]   so I can write a fair report.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.520]   It's true, but it doesn't mean
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.240]   that he's a terrible businessman
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.120]   because the businesses are taking money out currently.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.640]   The two other points I need to make on this before we go on.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.120]   Once you have a lot of wealth,
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.520]   you can live on your accumulated wealth and not pay tax.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.120]   So imagine that you have $10 million
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.880]   and you have a million dollars of cash in the bank.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.280]   You have businesses,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.400]   you have $9 million of investment assets,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.720]   and those investment assets
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.960]   are not cashflow generating assets.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   Maybe you're, what's the guy who started CNN
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.800]   who bought all the ranches,
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.720]   blanking on his name,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.040]   but the guy who famously bought all the ranches
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.560]   and one of the biggest private landowners
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.400]   in the United States
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.200]   has all this basically unproductive land.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.840]   In a situation like that, you've bought all this land,
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.360]   you have $9 million worth of land.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.880]   Now that land may be appreciating, it may not be,
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.520]   but the land is just sitting out there.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.720]   But meanwhile, you have a business over on the side
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.640]   and that business is a good lifestyle oriented business,
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.000]   Ted Turner, that's who it was.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.880]   Thank you from the live chat here, Ted Turner,
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.040]   Montana Ted, the grills.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.520]   So you have this lifestyle business
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.760]   that provides you with a way to shelter
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.320]   most of your lifestyle expenses,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.680]   your travel, your movements,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.080]   some of your dining expenses,
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.080]   you have a hotel here, a restaurant there,
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.720]   a couple of glamor businesses
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.160]   that you enjoy being involved in
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.600]   that give you something interesting to do,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.360]   but you still have $30,000 of annual just personal expenses.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   Well, you can easily have $9 million of investment assets
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.680]   sitting there, growing without any tax
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.560]   because they're capital gains assets.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.240]   You can easily have businesses
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.400]   that are providing you with a lifestyle of $250,000 a year
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.220]   through genuine, legitimate, ordinary business expenses
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.880]   in those businesses.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.020]   While meanwhile, you just simply take $30,000 a year
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.440]   from your million dollars of savings
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.680]   and use that to spend on personal expenses.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.960]   So someone in that situation could go for 30 years,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.840]   never make a profit on any of their businesses,
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.440]   never make a profit and live like a multimillionaire,
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.280]   genuinely legitimately having a great lifestyle
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.040]   and not owe a dime of income tax in that situation.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.460]   So these taxes are not a tell-all is the basic point.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   Taxes don't, the tax returns are not what you need.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:15.280]   What you need is the income statement.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.820]   What you need is the balance sheet.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.100]   And so when you see how the balance sheet
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.500]   and the income statement are working together,
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.620]   that tells you the story,
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.860]   but the tax returns do not tell you that accounting story.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.620]   They don't give you the details that you need
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.820]   to actually understand what's going on.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.140]   So when the New York Times quote says this,
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.240]   the picture that perhaps emerges most starkly
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.520]   from the mountain of figures and tax schedules
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.400]   prepared by Mr. Trump's accountants
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.920]   is of a businessman president
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.580]   in a tightening financial vice.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.040]   Is the New York Times right?
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.880]   I would say probably, right, possibly,
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.000]   although I'll show why I don't think that's the case.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.760]   Any president that leaves office
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.520]   is destined for unlimited amounts of wealth
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.880]   due to the way that politics works in the United States,
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.860]   is destined for unlimited amounts of wealth.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.240]   And so if President Trump leaves office today,
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.040]   his stint as the President of the United States
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.720]   will have been one of the best, most profitable uses
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.640]   of his four years in terms of his financial situation.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.400]   He will never have problems
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.520]   with dealing with these details ever again.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.720]   And I'm not alleging corruption.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.040]   I'm not alleging backdoor deals or anything like that.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.900]   That's just the way the presidency works, right?
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.080]   You go and you give $400,000 speeches.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.360]   You go and you're invited into all,
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.000]   it's just, that's the way the modern presidency works.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.060]   So you can't learn this though from tax returns.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.260]   You need the full picture to actually understand this.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.980]   Now, let's go on to talk about
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.620]   one of the things that I think is very interesting here
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.940]   due to the discussion of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.900]   The New York Times talks about an audit
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.380]   on his apprentice income.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.740]   Most of Mr. Trump's core enterprises
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.220]   from his constellation of golf courses
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.220]   to his conservative magnet hotel in Washington
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.640]   report losing millions, if not tens of millions of dollars
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.920]   year after year.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.240]   His revenue from the apprentice
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.160]   and from licensing deals is drying up.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.620]   And several years ago, he sold nearly all the stocks
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.380]   that now might have helped him plug holes
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.900]   in his struggling properties.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.460]   The tax audit looms.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.620]   And within the next four years,
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.900]   more than $300 million in loan obligations
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.300]   for which he is personally responsible will come due.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.240]   One of the things that you see in this article
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.540]   from a financial planner's perspective
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.860]   is an abundance of numbers
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.860]   that don't actually tell you anything that you need to know.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.900]   And that's what's frustrating about this.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.140]   Because the New York Times
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.780]   is certainly engaging in journalism, right?
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   They're certainly working to make their journalistic point
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:43.060]   and to clearly say, here's what you need to know.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.540]   But without the context of the balance sheet
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.740]   and the income statement, you can't know.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.940]   Is $300 million in loans coming due a lot or a little?
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.020]   Well, the answer depends on the value of the properties
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.980]   and the cashflow of those properties
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.860]   and his overall willingness to fund them.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.700]   You don't know that.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:06.040]   $300 million on a property portfolio worth $100 million,
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.060]   that could be a problem.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.100]   $300 million on a property portfolio worth $900 million
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.540]   is not a problem, even if the cashflow is low.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.700]   Excuse me.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.740]   One of the things that's fascinating to me
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.340]   is the conversation and discussion
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.860]   about just the nature of Mr. Trump's businesses.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.420]   They go through and they talk about
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.180]   how none of the scandalous things
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.320]   are actually listed in the tax returns.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.380]   So we don't know is the point that they make.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.500]   For example, did President Trump
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.340]   write off the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels?
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.780]   It's not listed.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.380]   We don't know any of that information.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:54.540]   But the most important section to me
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.720]   from a business perspective is this.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.260]   To delve into the records is to see,
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.220]   quoting from the story,
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.300]   "To delve into the records is to see up close
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.380]   "the complex structure of the president's business interests
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.840]   "and the depths of his entanglements.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.260]   "What is popularly known as the Trump Organization
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.580]   "is in fact a collection of more than 500 entities,
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.380]   "virtually all of them wholly owned by Mr. Trump,
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.240]   "many carrying his name.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.800]   "For example, 105 of them are a variation
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.040]   "of the name Trump Marks,
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.980]   "which he uses for licensing deals.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.220]   "Fragments of Mr. Trump's tax returns
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.060]   "have leaked out before.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.900]   "Transcripts of his main federal tax form,
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.580]   "the 1040 from 1985 to 1994,
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.860]   "were obtained by the Times in 2019.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.240]   "They showed that in many years,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.940]   "Mr. Trump lost more money
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.380]   "than nearly any other individual American taxpayer."
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.100]   And I would point out to you that the reason,
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.300]   if you understand these basic lessons that I have said,
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.780]   from a tax planning perspective,
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.020]   Trump is doing everything that you're supposed to do
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.540]   to save on taxes.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.720]   And the reason that he owes no taxes,
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.460]   basically, in terms of the way
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.580]   that they've arranged it so far,
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.660]   although it's not technically true
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.680]   when we go back to some of those five out of the 10 years,
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.440]   is simply that he has lost,
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.320]   that he's lost money on the businesses.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.580]   But if you understand the nature
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:11.860]   of why do you have 500 businesses,
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.540]   you have 500 businesses so that you can spread
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.460]   your income across those businesses in the best way,
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.560]   and also so that you can spread your expenses
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.780]   across those businesses in the most efficient way.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.000]   And it's exactly the same reason why,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.500]   if you're a private client of mine
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.780]   and you're a newly minted multimillionaire,
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:29.780]   the first thing that you do,
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.240]   and you say, "I wanna save on taxes,"
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.940]   we look at your current business,
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.760]   we look and say,
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.520]   "How can you get the maximum legal benefits
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.740]   "from that business?"
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.100]   And then we look at the rest of your lifestyle,
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.460]   and we say, "How can we start additional businesses
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.000]   "that are going to defray the tax obligations
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.760]   "that you have from these over here?"
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.260]   Now, the New York Times talked a little bit here
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:54.260]   about the overseas taxes that he has paid.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.820]   Now, certainly this is one of those things
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.980]   that sounds very scandalous from the basic perspective
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.980]   of you have the US president who's paying, allegedly,
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.900]   more money in overseas tax payments
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:14.500]   for his businesses abroad than he is in the United States.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.540]   And I can't find that in the article here.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:23.480]   That's interesting, but it actually is entirely
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.400]   to be expected with the nature
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.720]   of overseas engagements as well.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.480]   So let me skip past that point.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.860]   We go now to the section here of loser and winner.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.480]   And here's the headline of this section.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.600]   Losses reported by businesses Mr. Trump
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.520]   Mr. Trump owns and runs helped wipe out tax bills
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.560]   on hundreds of millions of dollars in celebrity income.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.200]   My notes, my marginalia on this article says, "Duh."
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.680]   Right? "Duh."
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.320]   That is the entire point.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.960]   When you generate large amounts of income
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.560]   that's not otherwise shelterable,
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.920]   because taxes are such a ridiculous,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   brutal expense for business, you have to shelter that.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.620]   And so you immediately need to create losses
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.380]   to offset against that income.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.320]   That's tax planning 101.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.960]   What do we say at a normal level?
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.160]   You have a client, client comes in and says,
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   "I'm a lawyer and I'm trying to,
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:25.600]   "I'm a lawyer and I'm gonna have a big settlement.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.020]   "I'm gonna have $10 million of income
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.200]   "from this big settlement this year."
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.840]   Well, if that lawyer is sitting in my office,
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.200]   then I say, "Buddy, you got a problem.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.360]   "You can't show $10 million of income.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.420]   "The IRS is gonna wipe out four of that 10 million."
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:39.660]   And so what are you gonna do?
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.980]   You immediately need to figure out
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.620]   where can you create losses.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.060]   So can you buy some investments?
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.280]   That's one choice.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.060]   Can you buy a business, a building
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.060]   that's gonna need renovation expenses or repairs?
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.900]   Can we find a business that's gonna have tons of repairs
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.260]   associated with it, where we can fix it up,
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.660]   but it not cross the line into actual improvement
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.180]   so that we can deduct in the current year
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.840]   all those repairs and generate losses from that?
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.780]   Can you take your race car hobby
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.440]   and can we turn that into a business?
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.740]   Because maybe you're gonna start
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.820]   a race car business in the future.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.780]   So can we go ahead and move that now
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.540]   and then use those startup expenses for that business
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.700]   to offset this $10 million tax bill this year?
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:24.640]   That's what you do as a tax planner.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:31.500]   The other thing that you see Trump doing
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.780]   is you see him managing his personal brand
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.520]   in a comprehensive way.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.460]   And this is, to me, what is fascinating.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.780]   I'm gonna read to you three and a half related paragraphs,
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.700]   and I want you to watch how this pays off.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.400]   Remember that the earlier allegation in the story
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   was that the New York Times reporters said
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.200]   that Mr. Trump's image is primarily flash
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.540]   rather than substance, but then later they write this.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.240]   Mr. Trump's net income from his fame,
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.420]   his 50% share of The Apprentice,
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.380]   together with the riches showered upon him
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.160]   by the scores of suitors paying to use his name,
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:07.160]   totaled $427.4 million through 2018.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.620]   A further $176.5 million in profit came to him
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.540]   through his investment
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.860]   in two highly successful office buildings.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.380]   Now you can make the argument that,
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.700]   well, Trump was given a lot of money by his father
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.940]   and he could have invested it better in some other way.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.980]   It's fine to make that argument, I think.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.260]   But what I would point out is that Trump leveraged
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:30.380]   his high profile, his buildings, his image,
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:34.560]   to move himself into an obscenely profitable business deal,
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.600]   The Apprentice, that made him a lot of money.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.820]   For most people, making $400 million,
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:44.120]   or in this case, $600 million with these two named things,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.300]   that's the win of a lifetime.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.980]   Most people, if they made $400 million,
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.800]   would immediately stop and not engage in anything else.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.180]   Now, continuing on, quoting,
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.720]   "So how did he escape nearly all taxes on that fortune?"
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.020]   There's your lesson for you.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.080]   "Even the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1%
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.360]   "of Americans could have caused him
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.720]   "to pay more than $100 million."
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.760]   The answer rests in a third category
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.220]   of Mr. Trump's endeavors,
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.160]   businesses that he owns and runs himself.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.980]   Duh, I've been teaching you this
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.800]   on Radical Personal Finance for years.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.880]   "The collective and persistent losses he reported from them
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.960]   "largely absolved him from paying federal income taxes
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.240]   "on the $600 million from The Apprentice
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.180]   "branding deals and investments."
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.200]   Again, it's what I've been teaching you for years.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.920]   If you have income and you can't avoid it,
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.260]   what you need is losses to offset that income.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.080]   So you do that with assets
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.320]   where you can grow your value and capital gains,
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.140]   which is not currently taxable,
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.960]   rather than generating current income.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.160]   That equate, continuing, quote,
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.580]   "That equation is a key element
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.200]   "of the alchemy of Mr. Trump's finances.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.480]   "Use the proceeds of his celebrity
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.320]   "to purchase and prop up risky businesses,
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.480]   "then wielding their losses to avoid taxes."
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.760]   What I would point out to you
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.320]   is that that goes right back to the previous paragraphs.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.160]   What do you do?
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.460]   You build a brand with buildings,
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.860]   with renovating Central Park and Trump Tower in downtown.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.540]   Go back to his story in the '80s and the '90s.
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.740]   You build a brand.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.820]   Then what he did is he's taken that brand
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.820]   and expanded that brand into many things,
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.500]   some things that succeeded, some things that didn't succeed,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.480]   Trump Stakes and Trump University and all these failures.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.820]   You isolate, as I teach you,
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.260]   you isolate all of your business dealings
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.420]   so that when something fails,
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.840]   like Trump University or Trump Stakes or whatever,
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.820]   you cut it off, those businesses go into bankruptcy,
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:29.780]   you segregate the losses on those businesses,
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.500]   but then all of this enhances your personal image.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.660]   And so in this case, then he takes his personal image,
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.900]   he leverages it into The Apprentice,
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.980]   which was a cash cow for him.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.660]   Then you take that fame, and in this case,
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.300]   he leveraged that fame eventually to the presidency,
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.520]   going into politics,
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.180]   but you take that and you leverage it back in.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.980]   "Look, I have all these luxury golf courses.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.820]   "I have all this other luxury stuff."
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.060]   And you build the brand.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.520]   He is obsessed with the brand,
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.780]   the gold-plated brand all the way across,
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.120]   continuing from the New York Times story.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   That equation is a key element of the alchemy
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.180]   of Mr. Trump's finances,
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.640]   using the proceeds of his celebrity
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.200]   to purchase and prop up risky businesses,
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.480]   then wielding their losses to avoid taxes.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.880]   Throughout his career, Mr. Trump's business losses
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.360]   have often accumulated in sums larger
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.060]   than could be used to reduce taxes
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   on other income in a single year,
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.980]   but the tax code offers a workaround.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.780]   With some restrictions, business owners can carry forward
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.900]   leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.680]   My comment, exactly.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.280]   This is why you want lumpy income and lumpy deductions,
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.500]   and this is why you take risks on things,
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.920]   because if you have other income that you can offset,
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.600]   if something doesn't work out, you take the risk on it,
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.960]   and then you can bring it over,
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.760]   and you lump those deductions against your other income.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:47.640]   The tax code incentivizes risk-taking,
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.080]   and you need to understand that.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.480]   The tax code incentivizes risk-taking.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.760]   As I have, in the years that I've taught tax planning to you,
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.840]   here on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.940]   what I've tried to emphasize is that
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.920]   there are not two tax codes,
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.000]   one for the poor and one for the rich.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.680]   There's not a special tax code for the poor
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.480]   and a special tax code for the rich.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.700]   There are two tax codes in this way.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.320]   There's one for employees,
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.560]   and there's one for business owners,
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.440]   and the employee tax code has basically nothing good in it.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.980]   Basically, if you are an employee,
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.240]   you get screwed by the tax code every single time.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.680]   You get screwed every single way.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.800]   You pay through the nose.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.720]   You lose more than half your income in some states.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.680]   Just think about that, how obscene that is.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.440]   You lose more than half your income
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.520]   if you're living in certain states
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.000]   and combining state income taxes and federal taxes
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   and employment taxes.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.880]   It's utterly obscene.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.360]   Employees get skinned every which way by the tax code.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   Why?
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.600]   Because employees bring very little value to the economy.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.520]   Employees don't generally create something that grows.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.920]   Employees don't employ people.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.760]   All employees do is serve as one individual body,
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.200]   and that's why they get skinned
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.600]   by the tax code every single time.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.240]   So there are two tax codes,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.960]   but it's not a tax code for the poor
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.300]   and a tax code for the rich.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.880]   It's a tax code for employees
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.080]   and a tax code for business owners
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.920]   and investors incumbent in that, business owners.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.840]   And that tax code is where all the good stuff is.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.480]   And so why do I say that everybody needs a business?
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.880]   Because that tax code is where all the good stuff is.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.160]   And you have every right to use that tax code
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.240]   whether you're totally broke
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.600]   or whether you're a multi-billionaire.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.760]   It's exactly the same.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.640]   The same rules that apply to President Trump
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.620]   apply to you and to me.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.920]   But it takes risk for us to go out
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.440]   and get involved in business.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.280]   It's hard.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.160]   It takes a lot of hours.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.240]   It takes a lot of work,
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.200]   but it's available to you exactly the same way.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.960]   So continuing on here.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.760]   The newer tax returns show that Mr. Trump
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.080]   burned through the last of the tax-reducing power
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.440]   of that $1 billion, which was a previous loss,
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.320]   a $1 billion in 2005,
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.160]   just as a torrent of entertainment riches
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.200]   began coming his way
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.640]   following the debut of "The Apprentice" the year before.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.400]   Now, listen to the next two paragraphs
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.300]   in light of what I've said.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.280]   If you generate income, you need deductions.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.520]   For 2005 through 2007, cash from licensing deals
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.080]   and endorsements filled Mr. Trump's bank accounts
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   with $120 million in pure profit,
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.600]   i.e. taxable profit, Joshua's comment.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.920]   With no prior year losses left to reduce his taxable income,
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.120]   he paid substantial federal income taxes
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.200]   for the first time in his life, a total of $70.1 million.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.600]   As his celebrity income swelled,
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.760]   Mr. Trump went on a buying spree,
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.400]   unlike any he had had since the 1980s
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.200]   when eager banks and his father's wealth
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.400]   allowed him to buy or build the casinos,
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.280]   airplanes, yacht, and old hotel that would soon lay him low.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.580]   Now, in the light of tax planning,
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.680]   are you surprised that when someone generates
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.880]   a whole bunch of taxable income, they go on a buying spree?
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.920]   When "The Apprentice" premiered,
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.040]   Mr. Trump had opened only two golf courses
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.320]   and was renovating two more.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.520]   By the end of 2015, he had 15 courses
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.440]   and was transforming the old post office building
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.000]   in Washington into a Trump International Hotel.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.360]   But rather than making him wealthier,
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.560]   the tax records reveal, as never before,
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.960]   each new acquisition only fed the downward draft
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.440]   on his bottom line.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.240]   I wanna point out is that might be true,
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.400]   but we don't know that it's true
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.880]   because you cannot pull that out of a tax record.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.720]   You don't know what has happened to the capital,
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.600]   the value of the asset.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.920]   It may very well be that that asset has become very valuable,
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.960]   but you don't know.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.640]   You also don't know where you are
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.400]   in the trajectory of a business.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   Most businesses lose money in the beginning.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.100]   Now, that, ideally, there are some business structures
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.920]   that naturally lend themselves well to not doing that,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.840]   but most businesses, especially businesses
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.840]   that require tremendous capital expense,
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.160]   like buildings and equipment
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.120]   and thousands of mattresses
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.280]   and thousands of plates and all that stuff,
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.040]   like hotels and real estate,
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.640]   they lose money in the beginning.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.480]   So you have to look and say,
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.720]   where is this business in its life cycle?
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.800]   So pretend, let me give you an example.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.520]   Pretend that you decide to start a gym.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.120]   That can be a very expensive proposition.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.560]   And here I'm thinking not of a CrossFit style gym
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.440]   with minimal equipment.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.560]   I'm thinking of a gym with hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.040]   of expensive machines and infrastructure and et cetera.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.400]   You start the gym.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.760]   Well, at what point in time does your gym become profitable?
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.520]   I don't know, but many businesses like that,
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.160]   it'd be three years, four years, five years.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.240]   And so where are you in that life cycle?
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.480]   So what we don't know here is it's 2020.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.900]   And what we know is that in 2007,
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.840]   President Trump, from 2005 to 2007, he made a lot of cash.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.660]   Then he went on a buying spree,
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.760]   evidently sometime between 2007 and 2015.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.920]   By the end of 2015, he had 15 courses
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.720]   and was transforming the old post office building
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.900]   into a hotel.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.300]   But where are we in the business cycle of the business?
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.360]   Once you have a golf course,
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.580]   and if it's in demand, it can be very profitable.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.740]   But if you have to renovate it, it can be expensive.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:00.220]   So I feel like I'm giving too many disclaimers.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.700]   My point is not to say that President Trump
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.020]   is a brilliant businessman.
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.200]   I don't know if he is or isn't.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.340]   I haven't seen his balance sheet.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.500]   I haven't seen his income statement.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.420]   It hasn't been done in the fullness of time.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.180]   I would say my instinct is that he has a killer,
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.540]   my opinion is that he has a killer instinct
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.980]   for how to leverage a brand
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.100]   into increasingly profitable things,
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.420]   which is what I think he'll do after the presidency,
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.620]   whether the presidency for him ends in 2020 or 2024,
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.340]   he will continue to leverage that brand
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.960]   and he'll build it again and again.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.040]   I don't expect him to have financial trouble ever again
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.340]   in the rest of his life.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.660]   But the tax, so my point is not to make a comment
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.500]   on his business acumen.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.020]   My point is to make a comment that this article,
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.940]   unless they have the income statements
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.220]   and the balance sheets,
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.160]   you can't know this purely from tax returns, in my opinion,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.660]   because the tax returns do not reflect
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.300]   unrealized depreciation, unrealized capital gains.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.100]   You may very well suck up cash.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.620]   And these numbers, for example,
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.180]   the story is full of numbers.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.540]   Consider the results of his latest golf resort,
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.520]   Trump National Doral near Miami.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.580]   Mr. Trump bought the resort for $150 million in 2012.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:11.900]   Through 2018, his losses have totaled $162.3 million.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.260]   He's pumped $213 million of fresh cash into Doral,
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.660]   tax records show, and has a $125 million mortgage balance
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.260]   coming due in three years.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.800]   Question is how much income?
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.940]   We don't know, because we can't know that.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.020]   The fact that he has losses don't tell us
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.380]   that he's a bad businessman.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.980]   It just tells us that he has losses,
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.360]   or at least tax losses.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.540]   Quote, "Even so, the rules do hold,"
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:38.920]   talking about depreciation,
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.940]   "Depreciation, though, is not a magic wand.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.620]   "It involves real money spent or borrowed
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.880]   "to buy buildings or other assets
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.540]   "that are expected to last years.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.540]   "Those costs must be spread out as expenses
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.680]   "and deducted over to the useful life of the asset.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.020]   "Even so, the rules do hold particular advantages
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.200]   "for real estate developers like Mr. Trump,
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.280]   "who are allowed to use their real estate losses
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.180]   "to reduce their taxable income from other activities."
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.820]   And that is the key tax planning tip.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.300]   As a full-time real estate businessman,
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.200]   Trump can use his losses from real estate
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.660]   to offset his other income,
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.180]   because he's a full-time,
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.160]   he's in the business of real estate.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.320]   And that has been one of his powerful tools.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.040]   That's one of the reasons why real estate
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.540]   is always such a powerful tool
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.660]   in a tax planner's arsenal.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.620]   Many years ago, in the tax code,
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.360]   there were many other useful tools.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.640]   But over the last 30 years,
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.260]   the tax code has been tightened up so much
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.120]   that the vast majority of loopholes
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.780]   that were previously available are now gone.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.420]   I have looked for years as a tax planner,
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.300]   trying to find where are all the good loopholes, right?
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.140]   Where are the loopholes for the rich?
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.300]   The vast majority of them are gone.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.720]   And things like this with real estate,
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.880]   they're not a loophole.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.280]   They're just simply a feature
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.360]   that you can do with a scale of $100,000 properties,
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.440]   or you can do with a scale of $300 million properties.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.300]   Let's talk about some of the other controversies in it.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.640]   I wanna read three quotes here.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.960]   There's some stupid New York Times commentary.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.300]   Again, I'm not a basher of newspapers,
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.080]   but it's interesting that the New York Times,
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.960]   and most modern newspapers, right?
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.000]   There's really not any, they can't help.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.720]   Their perspective, their bias is so,
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.040]   their bias is so
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.600]   endemic that they can't help it.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.840]   They can't help but see through it.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.960]   And so the article is full of all kinds of little quips
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.080]   and whatnot that are clearly negative.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.400]   I think the authors did a good job
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.560]   of trying to report the facts.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.760]   I mean, they know that this article
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.760]   is gonna be the most viewed of all time,
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:56.340]   but it's still full of it.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.240]   But let me, I don't wanna get into the politics.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.180]   Quote, "Once again, his businesses losses
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.140]   "mostly absolved his tax responsibilities.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.100]   "He paid no federal income taxes for 2014."
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.740]   One of the points I wanna make that's important
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.060]   is that just because somebody
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.100]   does not have any current tax due
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.900]   does not mean that they won't pay tax.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.500]   So let's go back to my example,
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.980]   where you bought the house for $150,000,
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:22.180]   you fixed it up, and you have $300,000,
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.180]   and then you flipped it to the developer for $500,000.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.380]   Maybe you were just the world's greatest real estate picker,
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.540]   and you picked that house that you bought for 500,
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.700]   and now it's worth $2.5 million.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.960]   Now, the question is this.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.620]   You have reported $0, let's assume it's land
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.660]   and not even creating rents.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:46.420]   You've reported $0 of income from that property,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.800]   but you have $2.5 million asset.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.000]   Is that asset owned by you tax-free?
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.540]   The answer is so far, yes, but not forever.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:01.060]   And that's one of the other key things
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.580]   about anything related here to the New York Times article.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.060]   Taxes and tax returns give you a snapshot in time,
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:11.900]   but they don't give you the full understanding
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.540]   of whether somebody is a net tax contributor or not.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.920]   So if we were trying to really do this
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.980]   from a tax perspective, and you would say,
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.900]   well, is President Trump, what is the total lifetime value
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.540]   of President Trump's business activities
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.840]   to the coffers of the US Treasury?
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.220]   That would be a fair and interesting question.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:35.620]   But the answer is we don't know yet.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.280]   Now, we will know in the fullness of time,
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.300]   but that fullness of time has to be
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.140]   that President Trump is dead,
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.780]   because that's the point in time
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.420]   at which the US government will stop taxing him.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.420]   And until President Trump is dead,
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.740]   we won't understand what his total lifetime contributions are
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.460]   to the coffers of the US Treasury.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.460]   Will he be a net negative on the tax code?
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.400]   Not in any way, which is why earlier I mentioned
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.980]   about the productivity of the businesses,
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.000]   the salaries that are paid,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.420]   the employment taxes, et cetera.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.760]   Not in any way will he be a net negative.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.220]   His contribution, even with everything
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.200]   in the New York Times article,
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.820]   his contribution to the tax rolls of the United States
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.100]   will be far bigger than the average professional
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.140]   in the United States.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:28.020]   Excuse me.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.460]   His contributions will be far bigger
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.660]   than the average professional in the United States.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.580]   There'll be many, many multiples of that
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.620]   because of him being a businessman.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:39.300]   But what we don't know is we don't know
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.420]   what the total cost is,
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.620]   because everything has to be marked to market,
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.900]   either at the sale of the properties,
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.700]   at the transfer of the properties,
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.260]   or at his death when the estate taxes are due.
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.340]   Because in the United States,
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.220]   you cannot go forever without paying taxes.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.460]   You simply can't.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.100]   Now, you can go for a very long time
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.360]   in a very few circumstances.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.380]   For example, it is possible that somebody could put
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:10.060]   some property into a trust,
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.780]   into some kind of dynasty trust, right?
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.820]   Maybe a trust in Florida,
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.660]   the dynasty trust in Florida for 360 years.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.860]   And you can transfer this property into the trust
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.060]   and the property generates no income,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.860]   no income whatsoever.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.860]   It could be whatever kind of asset that has no income.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.400]   And it sits in the trust for 300 years.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.380]   Well, it's generating no income.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.800]   Thus, the trust is not paying any taxes on the money.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.940]   But at some point in time, 300 years from now,
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.460]   when that property is sold, the taxes are gonna be due.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.060]   And it'll be taxed 300 years from now.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.660]   That's about as far as you can possibly go,
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.700]   is that kind of dynasty trust in the US tax system.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.020]   But you have to have no income in the property
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.460]   for it to not be taxed for that long period of time.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.740]   Now, could that be a massive tax savings?
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.340]   Yeah, for 300 years, the newspapers could write about
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.500]   how there's $100 million of property
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.460]   sitting here in this trust, and it's paying $0 of tax.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.380]   Why?
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.660]   Because it's not taxing income.
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.040]   There's no tax on wealth at the moment
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.660]   in the United States of America.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.380]   There's only a tax on income.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.580]   So in the same way, President Trump's property
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.060]   can sit here for year after year after year.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.940]   They may or may not be appreciating.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:26.040]   He'll owe taxes on the current profits due,
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.060]   but if there are losses, he won't owe taxes.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.660]   But he will eventually.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.820]   So if President Trump owns Trump Tower,
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.020]   whichever, or Trump Hotel, whichever one you want,
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.060]   or Trump Golf Course, if he owns it,
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.060]   and he decides in the year 2030
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.020]   that he wants to sell that property,
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.300]   when that property is sold, he will now owe tax.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.260]   And so it's conceivable that he could lose
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:49.460]   $20 million per year on a property for 20 years,
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.060]   and then sell the property in the 20th year
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.620]   for a $500 million profit,
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.220]   and have a massive tax bill in that 20th year
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.340]   because of the nature of real estate.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.700]   So once again, tax returns don't tell us much.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.660]   All they tell us is that he doesn't currently owe taxes
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.820]   because he currently doesn't have taxable income
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.740]   from his business affairs.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.580]   And so you need to keep that in mind,
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.260]   that he will eventually pay the tax.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.940]   Now, what can you do as an individual to eliminate tax?
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.060]   As long as you don't get into the world of estate taxes,
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.540]   then you can actually own property totally tax-free.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.700]   I gave you this earlier, but I wanna repeat it now.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.580]   You buy a property,
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:30.180]   you buy a million dollars worth of property.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.780]   You own the property personally,
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.940]   you have some income from the property.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.780]   Maybe you don't.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.860]   Maybe you go and buy one of Ted Turner's ranches,
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.420]   and it's totally unproductive from a financial perspective,
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.100]   but you love it because it gives you a place
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.500]   to ride your horses and see the buffalo.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.740]   You own that property, you own it for 50 years,
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:47.860]   and it goes in value from $1 million
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   to $10 million 50 years from now,
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.820]   and you just leave it outright to your children.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.580]   Well, your children can inherit the property
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.060]   for $10 million, and they'll inherit it free and clear
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.020]   as long as your estate doesn't owe taxes.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.740]   Now, if you start to get into a place
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.940]   where you have an estate that has a taxable value
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.820]   beyond the 20-something million-ish dollars
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.220]   right now in the United States,
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.860]   then now all of a sudden, when you died,
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:08.460]   your estate would owe taxes.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.620]   But the most you can do is do this
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.620]   with 10-ish million dollars for you,
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.020]   10-ish million dollars for your spouse,
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.260]   up to about $20 million for the family
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.740]   before you start to have to do estate tax planning.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.500]   And so the point is that just because taxes
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.420]   are not paid currently doesn't mean that taxes are not paid.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.820]   So always keep that in mind.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:30.140]   This is clearly a politically inflammatory piece,
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.460]   and nobody in the United States understands taxes.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:33.540]   I've been studying it for years,
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.340]   and I am scared to do a show like this
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.460]   because I'm sure I'll get something wrong.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.380]   But the argument is basically,
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:42.820]   well, President Trump doesn't pay taxes.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.300]   My answer would be he isn't currently owing taxes
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.620]   because his businesses are not currently generating income,
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.620]   but that doesn't mean he won't owe taxes.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.340]   Next.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.980]   I'm belaboring some of these points too much.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:58.860]   I just wanted you to know
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.780]   that taxes cannot be avoided forever.
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.260]   That's the argument for estate taxes.
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.100]   I don't like estate taxes,
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.780]   but that's the argument for estate taxes
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:08.220]   is that eventually the taxes need to be paid
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.300]   because rich people can simply live
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.780]   on their money in the bank.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.420]   They don't have to incur taxes.
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.900]   And so if there's not estate taxes there
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.500]   to eventually force the taxation of property,
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.180]   then we've got a problem.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.580]   That's the argument for estate taxes,
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.860]   but you need to understand that.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.860]   All right, let's talk about the $72.9 million maneuver.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.220]   Quote, "The apprentice created
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.460]   what was probably the biggest income tax bite
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.700]   of Mr. Trump's life.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.140]   During the Great Recession bailout,
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.300]   he asked for the money back."
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.980]   Now, by now you should hear, as I hear,
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.940]   hey, the apprentice created a big income tax bite.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:40.980]   Why?
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.500]   Because it wasn't real estate.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.820]   It was just pure taxable income.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.260]   It was pure profits on the business of the apprentice.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.500]   And so he couldn't successfully offset it legally.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.100]   He couldn't generate enough deductions to offset it
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:58.100]   with other investment in order for him to cover all of it.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.180]   So he had to pay tens of millions of dollars in tax,
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.140]   on income tax, on the profits.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:09.140]   Then in 2010, he claimed and received an income tax refund
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.860]   totaling $72.9 million,
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.660]   all the federal income tax he had paid
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:17.940]   for 2005 through 2008 plus interest.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:20.620]   The records, so there's an ongoing audit,
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.500]   and the story basically affirms that on this particular
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.180]   piece, evidently President Trump has been truthful,
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.700]   to all of our surprise, right?
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.820]   "The records at the Times Reviewed square with the way
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.100]   Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited without explanation
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.260]   an ongoing audit as grounds for refusing
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.860]   to release his tax returns.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.820]   He alluded to it as recently as July on Fox News
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:41.660]   when he told Sean Hannity,
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.820]   "They treat me horribly, the IRS horribly."
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.660]   And while the records do not lay out all the details
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.500]   of the audit, they match his lawyer's statement
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.220]   during the 2016 campaign that audits of his returns
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.740]   for 2009 and subsequent years remained open
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.260]   and involved transactions or activities
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.780]   that were also reported on returns for 2008 or earlier.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.660]   So basically this worked like this,
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:02.580]   that as part of the bailout package in 2009,
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.420]   the US government removed the two-year look-back rule
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.260]   for deducting business losses.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:14.260]   And so under that part of the legislation at that time,
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:19.780]   then Trump was able to go back and use those losses
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.660]   to offset his previous income.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.820]   And so Mr. Trump had paid no income taxes in 2008,
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.460]   but the change meant that when he filed his taxes for 2009,
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.980]   he could seek a refund of not just the $13.3 million
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:35.980]   he had paid in 2007, but also the combined $56.9 million
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:41.740]   paid in 2005 and 2006, when the apprentice created
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:45.380]   what was likely the biggest income tax bite of his life.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.220]   And so he applied for the refund under the legislation,
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.540]   under the bailout legislation,
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.780]   and that started the rounds of auditing.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.500]   Now what the story explained was that these kinds of refunds
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.340]   require the approval of IRS auditors
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.540]   and an opinion of the Congressional Joint Committee
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.460]   on Taxation, a bipartisan panel better known
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.820]   for reviewing the impact of tax legislation.
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.100]   Tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.780]   larger than $2 million to individuals.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.620]   So that was interesting.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.580]   I didn't know that that existed.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.380]   I didn't know about that rule.
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.220]   But in short, for the last 10 years,
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:22.020]   Trump filed for the refund, but because it was so large,
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.380]   everything had to be reviewed,
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.820]   and it's basically been stuck in the committee
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.420]   for the last 10 years.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.380]   Now, evidently there was a resolution expected
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:35.800]   in about 2014 of this audit process,
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.560]   but then when Mr. Trump started to become
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.460]   politically prominent during the 2016
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:45.460]   Republican nomination process,
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.540]   then everything got kicked back to committee.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.460]   And so according to the New York Times,
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.420]   it's not clear why the case has stalled,
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.340]   but according to the New York Times,
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.140]   quote, "Experts say it suggests that the gap
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.500]   "between the sides remains wide.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.060]   "If negotiations were to deadlock,
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.220]   "the case would move to federal court
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:02.660]   "or it would become a matter of public record."
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.700]   Who knows?
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.620]   And so this is the most interesting part of it,
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.660]   where basically they are,
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.900]   the IRS and the Trump Organization
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:15.100]   have come to loggerheads, and it's basically sitting,
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.060]   probably because of its political sensitivity,
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.660]   which would be my guess.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.020]   Now, people are saying, was this fraudulent?
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:24.860]   I don't see any evidence from this New York Times article
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.580]   that it's fraudulent.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.100]   Let's talk about what it means to file for something.
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:33.420]   First of all, there's never a reason for you as an individual
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:37.940]   not to be aggressive in your tax reporting to the IRS.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.480]   There is no downside to being aggressive.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.360]   You cannot be fraudulent.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.060]   If you try to do something that is outright fraud,
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.860]   that's extremely dangerous to,
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.000]   that's extremely dangerous to your,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.060]   well, to your freedom, right?
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.620]   They can lock you up for that.
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:58.260]   But in the situation where you put yourself in,
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.840]   in a situation where you wanna be aggressive
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.820]   with something and file for it, there's no reason not to,
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:06.620]   because the only thing that the IRS will say is no,
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.280]   and the deduction will be disallowed,
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.580]   or in this case, the refund request would be disallowed.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.160]   So think about it from the Trump Organization perspective.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.760]   Trump paid, we'll call it $70 million of taxes.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.700]   Then Congress passed this bailout bill,
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.700]   which allowed you to carry back your,
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:23.980]   go back more than two years to your losses
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.740]   and deduct them against your previous tax bills paid.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.300]   So now that puts you in a situation
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.180]   where you're not in any way committing fraud
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.700]   by applying for it.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.100]   You go ahead and apply for it,
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.380]   and now you get a $70 million refund,
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:38.780]   or you make the request to the IRS
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.780]   of the $70 million refund.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.740]   The worst that the IRS can say is no, right?
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.220]   That's the worst that they can say.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.940]   If they say no, you're not in any worse place
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.540]   than you were previously.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.660]   If they say yes, you're $70 million richer.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.180]   If they say, well, we're not sure,
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.540]   we're gonna fight about it,
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.860]   depending on who has the money,
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.340]   and it's not clear to me from the article
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:59.420]   who has the money currently,
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.620]   whether the IRS has the $70 million,
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:02.860]   or Mr. Trump has it.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:05.060]   Actually, I think that Trump has it,
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.760]   because the article says that if he loses the dispute,
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.780]   then he'll owe the IRS $100 million,
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:12.380]   which is $70 million plus penalties and fees.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.900]   So in that situation, as a businessman,
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.740]   you have use of the $70 million
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.380]   while you're fighting the audit with the IRS.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:21.100]   You have the use of the $70 million.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.700]   You can use it however you want.
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:25.160]   And then eventually, if you lose your audit fight,
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.400]   then you'll have to pay it back,
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.960]   which is, of course, potentially a cashflow problem.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.540]   But in this scale, it should be handleable
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:33.680]   if you're wise and prudent with the money.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.300]   So that's, I think, the most interesting part
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.620]   of what's aware of it.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.380]   But I think to say that it's clearly fraudulent
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.140]   would be far too far.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.420]   To say that it's not,
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.220]   I wouldn't say that it's fraudulent.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.100]   If it were fraudulent, it would have been thrown out,
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.180]   is my opinion,
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.620]   as that anything that would be genuinely fraudulent,
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.700]   the tax, the judge would have ruled on it,
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.660]   the IRS would have ruled on it,
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:58.740]   the committee would have ruled,
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.700]   and everything would have been settled.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.980]   According to what Trump said in public,
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.780]   evidently he had reached some kind of agreement with them,
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.940]   which means that it was probably a questionable case
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:08.860]   where it could go either way,
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:11.460]   and they'd reach some kind of settlement between them.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.060]   And then he became politically prominent,
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.500]   and then everybody backed off of that.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.260]   Now we go to the 20%, which is the consultant's fees.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.740]   And let me explain to you the basic argument,
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:24.500]   and then we'll talk about how you can use this for yourself.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.340]   The New York Times headline,
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.500]   "The 20% Solution,
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.780]   Helping to Reduce Mr. Trump's Tax Bills
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.860]   Are Unidentified Consultant's Fees,
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.620]   Some of Which Can Be Matched to Payments
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.660]   Received by Ivanka Trump."
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.500]   Examining the Trump Organization's tax records,
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.740]   a curious pattern emerges.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.500]   Between 2010 and 2018,
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.860]   Mr. Trump wrote off some $26 million
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:44.820]   in unexplained consulting fees
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:48.220]   as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.940]   They explain a little bit about where they are,
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.460]   but there is no evidence that Mr. Trump,
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.860]   who mostly licenses his name,
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:55.860]   mysterious big payments,
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.300]   talk about foreign business deals,
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.020]   mysterious big payments and business deals
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.060]   can raise red flags,
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.380]   particularly in places where bribes
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.100]   or kickbacks to middlemen are routine.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.500]   But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump,
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.780]   who mostly licenses his name to other people's projects
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.700]   and is not involved in securing government approvals,
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:09.980]   has engaged in such practices.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.140]   We'll talk about the Foreign Practices Act in a moment,
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.060]   but this is one of those areas
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.140]   where the New York Times just can't help themselves, right?
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:16.740]   You raise a suspicion,
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.220]   and then you say, "Well, there's no evidence of it."
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.220]   It's like if I say,
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.060]   people who,
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.460]   I have children, right?
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.300]   And you say, you come,
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:26.540]   and you're writing a newspaper article about Joshua.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.140]   And you say, "Joshua has children,
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:31.180]   and people who have children
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.980]   have been known to abuse their children."
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:35.860]   There's no evidence that Joshua is abusing his children,
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.700]   right?
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.540]   But people who have children
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.380]   have been known to abuse their children.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.220]   That's what this is.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.540]   It's this stupid stuff that raises the suspicion.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.380]   And then you go on to say,
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.220]   "Well, there's no evidence of this."
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.220]   But now you've planted the seeds of doubt
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.380]   that people who have children abuse children,
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:51.260]   which is certainly technically true,
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.940]   that there are some people who have children
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.100]   who abuse children.
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.260]   Well, it's also true
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.020]   that the overwhelming majority of people who have children
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.740]   fight tooth and nail to protect their children
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:03.460]   from every harm that could possibly accrue to them.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.700]   And so that kind of stuff annoys me,
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.260]   but we'll move on.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.660]   Quote, "Rather, there appears
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.220]   to be a closer-to-home explanation
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.820]   for at least some of the fees.
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.780]   Mr. Trump reduced his taxable income
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:15.820]   by treating a family member as a consultant
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:19.780]   and then deducting the fee as a cost of doing business."
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:23.460]   Now, this particular scenario is raised as,
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.940]   "Is this questionable?"
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:27.620]   But from my perspective,
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.180]   I see no way that you can say that this is questionable.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:32.220]   This is standard practice.
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:34.660]   Let me bring this back from the billionaire perspective
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:36.380]   to talk about you and me.
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.420]   Let's pretend that I run an accounting office.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.220]   I have an accounting office,
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.180]   and I look around and I say,
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.020]   "You know what?
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.060]   I need someone to clean my office."
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.260]   And I could hire a commercial cleaning company
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.300]   to come and do it and pay them $1,000 a month
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.380]   for the privilege,
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.260]   but I could also hire my 15-year-old son
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.940]   to come and pay him $1,000 a month for the privilege.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:55.900]   I talked to my son and I say,
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.420]   "Would you like to come and clean my office for $1,000?"
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.260]   And he says, "I'll do it."
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:00.540]   "Yeah, absolutely."
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:01.620]   So what I have just done
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.660]   is I've done what's called income shifting.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.300]   It's one of the three basic techniques
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.500]   of income tax planning.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.380]   It's an income shifting strategy.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.140]   Where you're trying to shift income
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.620]   from a higher bracket taxpayer to a lower bracket taxpayer.
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:16.700]   You're trying to shift income from one party
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.340]   to another party within a family bound.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.060]   And there's nothing illegal about it.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.820]   It's entirely legal for you to hire your son
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.980]   $1,000 a month to clean your office.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.180]   Now, you want to make sure
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.060]   to properly account for that deduction.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.780]   You wanna make sure that
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.660]   there is a method of keeping track on him,
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.220]   that he's got a checklist of what he's supposed to do.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.740]   You wanna make sure that there's some kind of
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.060]   way to prove his attendance,
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.260]   that he's actually cleaning the office, et cetera.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:42.020]   But if he's coming in and cleaning the office
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.460]   and a commercial cleaner would charge you $1,000,
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.900]   you can pay him $1,000 as well.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:49.020]   So let's talk about the tax effect of this.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:51.700]   Did the taxes disappear?
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.540]   No, and yes, in a way.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:56.020]   So the first thing is they didn't disappear.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.420]   What you did was you took income,
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.180]   what would have been $12,000 for the year
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.660]   from your business, and you've shifted it to your son.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:06.940]   Now he has $12,000 of income.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:09.100]   And in this situation, evidently,
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.620]   that's what President Trump has done
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:14.500]   by shifting the income from the Trump Organization
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.220]   to his daughter, Ivanka Trump,
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.780]   in the form of consulting fees.
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.980]   And so it's some tens of millions of dollars
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.420]   over a period of time, the numbers are unclear,
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.860]   but the money that was gonna be taxable income
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.020]   to the Trump Organization
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:29.060]   is now taxable income to Ivanka Trump.
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:32.220]   So when I say that, did the taxes disappear?
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.540]   The answer is no, they didn't.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.420]   They've just changed parties.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.180]   So now Ivanka Trump has paid in taxes,
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.380]   and there's no allegations
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.300]   that she's not reported the income.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.780]   Evidently, she's reported it, she's paid taxes on it.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.580]   It's just simply been that Ivanka Trump
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:46.980]   has paid the taxes on the income
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.340]   rather than the Trump Organization,
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.040]   rather than President Trump himself.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.280]   Just like if you, in your accounting business,
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.540]   pay your son $12,000, he will pay the tax on $12,000,
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.020]   and you will not.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:03.140]   Now that's advantageous at the smaller level
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.100]   because you might very well be making $400,000
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.980]   as an accountant running a large accounting firm,
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:13.820]   and your tax rate may be approaching 50%, maybe it's 40%.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.740]   So therefore, you, with that $12,000,
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.300]   would perhaps lose, I'm gonna use 50% for clear math,
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.400]   you would lose $6,000 in taxes.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.140]   Whereas your son, if he has no other income,
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:28.380]   your son would wind up not owing any money on the $12,000
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:31.540]   because it's below the taxable threshold in that situation.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.060]   And so you've sheltered $12,000 from taxes
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.260]   by shifting it within the family.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.700]   As long as he's doing the work,
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.500]   and as long as there's a record there to prove it,
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.660]   it's entirely legal.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.100]   And so the same thing is the case
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.840]   with Ivanka's business expenses.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.840]   To me, I see nothing questionable about this
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.780]   from a perspective.
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:56.260]   Let me quote from the article.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.780]   There is no quote, "There is no indication
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:59.720]   "that the IRS has questioned Mr. Trump's practice
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.900]   "of deducting millions of dollars in consulting fees.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.020]   "If the payments to his daughter were compensation for work,
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.180]   "it is not clear why Mr. Trump would do it in this form
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:10.000]   "other than to reduce his own tax liability."
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.300]   Now, there is a IRS doctrine that says
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.220]   that you cannot do something
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:18.740]   for the sole purposes of reducing taxes.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:19.980]   Forget the name of the doctrine at the moment,
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.060]   but you can't just do something
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:23.280]   for the sole purposes of reducing taxes.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.260]   But these are areas where there's a broad leeway,
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.400]   where something can have the side benefit
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.760]   of reducing taxes.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.080]   And to say that I'm gonna pay consulting fees to Ivanka
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.660]   on a number of, you know, on a hotel in Azerbaijan
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:37.880]   or a hotel in Turkey or whatever,
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.600]   you could probably justify that in many ways.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.920]   So I don't buy the IRS saying
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.920]   that it's not clear why Mr. Trump would do it in this form
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.760]   other than to reduce his own tax liability.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.600]   Why not?
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.400]   Why not do that?
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.000]   Another more legally perilous possibility
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.800]   is that the fees were a way to transfer assets
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.200]   to his children without incurring a gift tax.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.240]   A Times investigation in 2018 found
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.800]   that Mr. Trump's late father, Fred Trump,
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.960]   employed a number of legally dubious schemes decades ago
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.940]   to evade gift taxes on millions of dollars
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.760]   he transferred to his children.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.760]   Now, I struggle with that word dubious.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.920]   What does dubious mean, right?
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.400]   Dubious means questionable or uncertain or,
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:22.480]   you know, it could go right or could go wrong.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.440]   Well, that's certainly an emotionally loaded word,
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.760]   but everything, many, many things in the tax code
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.960]   are dubious.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.880]   There are many times where you look at something and say,
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.400]   "I could go two ways on this."
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.520]   And so by that case, it's dubious.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.400]   And there are clear ways of resolving it.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.680]   There is an audit process.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.680]   And so if you are audited,
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:45.240]   then the issue will come before the tax court.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.080]   The judge and the court will consider previous precedent.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.460]   They'll consider what you've done.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.940]   If you've done something fraudulent,
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:53.060]   they will charge you for doing something fraudulent,
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:55.800]   even up to the point of criminal penalties
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.040]   in a very egregious case,
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.100]   but they'll charge you with something.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:00.940]   They'll take the money,
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.560]   and then they'll take your property to pay for it.
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.080]   So that word dubious is a very loaded word,
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.280]   but it doesn't exist.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.320]   Now, is he transferring money to his children
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.420]   without a gift tax?
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:14.920]   You could make that argument very clearly
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.480]   if his children were not engaged in the business.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.800]   And this is why it's so advantageous
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800]   to have a family business
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.800]   where your children are engaged in the business.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.500]   Is the net effect that Mr. Trump
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.820]   is transferring wealth to his children
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.300]   without paying gift taxes?
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.600]   Yes, but he's transferring wealth to his children
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.260]   at the price of income taxes.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.220]   Ivanka is receiving consulting fees,
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.500]   and she's paying taxes on those consulting fees.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.300]   So the money is still being taxed.
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:40.940]   It's not a tax fee transfer.
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.060]   That's the first point.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.940]   Second point, that in a situation like this,
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.660]   I don't think you could make an argument
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.280]   that this is not an appropriate payment
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.580]   because Ivanka is clearly very involved
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.060]   in the business organization.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:53.620]   She's involved in the White House currently.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.940]   She was involved in "The Apprentice."
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:57.220]   She's involved in the hotel organization.
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:59.520]   Now, if your daughter was sitting at home
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.460]   and never came into the office
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:03.860]   and was receiving millions of dollars a year
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.740]   of consulting fees,
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:06.980]   but she never came into the office,
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.460]   then certainly that would be fraudulent,
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.620]   and that would be denied.
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:10.920]   The deduction would be denied.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.600]   The income would be charged to the Trump organization,
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.580]   and there would probably be some kind of penalties.
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.820]   But in a situation where Ivanka is clearly involved,
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.900]   she's clearly earning the millions of dollars
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.100]   in consulting fees.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.880]   The fact that it might be a little bit generous,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.540]   these are the areas where there's a huge degree
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.980]   of subjectivity.
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:31.260]   And so it's one thing for you to say,
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.820]   my 15-year-old boy, I'm gonna get a $1,000 estimate
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.460]   from a cleaning company and use that.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.500]   It's another thing when you're running
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.620]   a multi-hundred-million-dollar
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.420]   or billion-dollar organization,
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:45.140]   and you're paying million-dollar consulting fees.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.940]   Now, I wanna talk for just a moment
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.620]   about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.300]   because this actually really impresses me.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.300]   Quoting from the article,
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.540]   "On the failed hotel deal in Azerbaijan,
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.620]   "which was plagued by suspicions of corruption,"
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.580]   again, kind of that underground argument of,
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.740]   okay, suspicions of corruption,
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:03.540]   it has an effect in the reader's mind.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.040]   It's probably factually, totally factually true,
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.860]   but it has the net effect
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.220]   that The New York Times is hoping for.
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:12.180]   "On the failed hotel deal in Azerbaijan,
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.220]   "which was plagued by suspicions of corruption,
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.260]   "a Trump organization lawyer told The New Yorker
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:19.060]   "the company was blameless because it was merely a licensure
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.240]   "and had no substantive role, adding,
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.060]   "We did not pay any money to anyone.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.020]   "Yet the tax records for the three Trump LLCs
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.200]   "involved in that project
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.940]   "show deductions for consulting fees
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:32.020]   "totaling $1.1 million that were paid to someone."
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.580]   The thing that's interesting to me about this
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.820]   is that I think the Trump organization
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.460]   has probably worked very, very hard
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:40.060]   to keep their hands clean around the world.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.100]   I'm not a Trumpist nor an anti-Trumper.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:45.200]   I've got, as with most times, complex opinions
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.500]   that many of which are in some ways contradictory,
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.660]   but it doesn't really matter, right?
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:52.260]   'Cause I'm not him, I'm not in any position of authority.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:55.860]   But one of the things that's the most difficult
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.700]   for US Americans is years ago,
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.580]   the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was passed.
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:02.980]   And the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:06.260]   bans the use of briberies or kickbacks
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.060]   to foreign officials in business deals.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.780]   And it comes with very, very severe penalties.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:13.600]   And this has made American companies
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.700]   extremely uncompetitive around the world
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.620]   in the past decade, since it was passed,
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:25.620]   because the penalties on this are very, very substantial.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:29.400]   If you as a US company are caught
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.860]   paying a bribe to a foreign official,
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.340]   that can be really, really damaging
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:37.260]   and personally, legally, very problematic.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.720]   And so it's interesting that Trump's strategy
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.860]   of just simply licensing his name
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:43.580]   is a really impressive strategy
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:46.180]   where it allows him to make money from these deals,
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.980]   but it allows his local partners
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:49.900]   to do whatever needs to be done
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:52.180]   in order to make the deal happen.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:56.440]   Now, I don't care much for the subject of paying bribes.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:03.040]   I think that accepting bribes is immoral and offensive.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.840]   And I think that paying bribes is very unwise,
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.620]   bordering on immoral in many circumstances,
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.700]   but certainly unwise.
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.060]   Unfortunately, there's a very big difference
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.740]   between countries and between cultures
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.740]   in the way that many places work.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:23.220]   And so it's very easy to sit in the United States and say,
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:25.460]   "Wow, I can't believe that so-and-so paid a bribe
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:26.900]   for such and such."
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.660]   Once you've spent some time traveling
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:29.940]   and doing business around the world,
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:34.940]   you learn that if some extra money doesn't change hands,
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:39.180]   then often you never get what you need done.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.720]   There's just simply no way to run a business
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.620]   in many countries unless money changes hands.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.980]   And this happens in the United States as well,
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:48.460]   but it happens in a different system.
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:49.740]   In the United States, it happens primarily
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.580]   in the form of political contributions.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.620]   The United States is a deeply corrupt country,
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.280]   but the corruption happens in a different way
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.980]   than it does in some other places.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:04.480]   But I thought it was an interesting point here
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.780]   of how Trump has elegantly sidestepped
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:11.500]   those potential legal problems with his use of licensing.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.180]   And it points out the power of building a brand
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.980]   because he's sunk so much money and attention and effort
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.700]   into building his gold-plated brand
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:23.140]   that then he could sell that brand around the world.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:26.480]   And it has a genuine value to local property developers.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.940]   The next thing that, in the next section of the Times article
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:30.980]   is talking about write-offs.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:33.160]   And this is the least interesting to me
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.800]   because it's all of what we know about.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.620]   The allegation is that President Trump
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.240]   is taking excessive numbers of write-offs.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.540]   Is it true?
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:48.860]   I would say certainly not, because if it were true,
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:53.680]   the IRS audit would have taken care of this,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:54.600]   would have found this.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.340]   And this is fairly clear.
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:57.860]   When you're dealing with the companies,
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:59.700]   you're not dealing with President Trump personally.
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.340]   He doesn't prepare a tax return.
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.500]   The lawyers do it.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.200]   The lawyers and the accountants are following the rules
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.260]   and they are taking the write-offs
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.880]   that are appropriately allowed by law.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.340]   I just don't buy for an instant
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:18.140]   that President Trump's buying extra table linens
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:20.220]   is somehow a big thing for him.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.380]   Now, they talk about this in the New York Times article.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.580]   Take, for example, Mar-a-Lago,
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:25.060]   now the president's permanent residence
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.020]   as well as a private club and stage
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:29.040]   set on which Trump luxury plays out.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.500]   As a business, it is also the source
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:31.900]   of millions of dollars in expenses
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.900]   deducted from taxable income.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:38.420]   Among them, $109,433 for linens and silver
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:43.020]   and $197,829 for landscaping in 2017.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.540]   Also deducted as a business expense
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:47.140]   was the $210,000 paid to a Florida photographer
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.660]   over the years for shooting numerous events at the club,
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:53.340]   including a 2016 New Year's Eve party hosted by Mr. Trump.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.580]   These are stupid details without any relevance whatsoever.
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:02.580]   If you wanted to understand how $109,433 for linens,
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.180]   whether that matters or not, what would you do?
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:09.060]   Well, you would say, let's pool the finances
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:11.660]   and let's go down the street to the Breakers Hotel
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:13.420]   or let's go to the Everglades Club
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.300]   or to the Bath and Tennis Club,
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.260]   also private clubs here on Palm Beach,
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:20.140]   and let's ask them how much they pay in linens.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.980]   And there's somehow, the article is trying
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.460]   to give this impression that somehow President Trump
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.280]   is enriching himself because he's overpaying on linens,
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.920]   which is just silly.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.900]   At the small level, then certainly at the smaller level,
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:37.160]   there are plenty of business owners who do this, right?
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.660]   You can imagine the guy who has a few thousand dollars
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:45.060]   of revenue and he takes and bills a couple extra $100
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.940]   in linens or cost of business,
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:49.260]   and he sells them out the back of his store
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.900]   and doesn't report the income, sure.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.620]   But the idea that Mar-a-Lago is overspending
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:56.260]   because they spent $109,000 for linens is silly.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:00.780]   I don't know anything about what they spend or don't spend.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.160]   You would have to compare it again to Everglades Club
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:08.160]   or go to the breakers and see how does this compare.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:13.180]   $197,829 for landscaping, to me, sounds about right, right?
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.360]   I've worked with clients that had a private house
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360]   and they have a full-time gardener
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.000]   with two part-time assistants.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.680]   Well, right there, they've got $100,000
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.520]   of annual landscaping bills for their estate in Palm Beach,
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.160]   and it's not an estate, it's a private club.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.080]   So you have to have context for all of these things.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.480]   What to me is the most interesting
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.500]   from a lifestyle perspective is what I want you to learn
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:32.900]   from the next paragraph.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.080]   Quote, "Mr. Trump has written off his business expense costs,
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:39.500]   "including fuel and meals associated with his aircraft
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:42.440]   "used to shuttle him among his various homes and properties.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.000]   "Likewise, the cost of haircuts,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.200]   "including the more than $70,000 paid
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.480]   "to style his hair during 'The Apprentice.'
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.560]   "Together, nine Trump entities have written off
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.340]   "at least $95,464 paid to a favorite hair
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:56.740]   "and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump."
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:59.460]   So there are multiple ways to look at that.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:03.040]   First of all, if you are a financially productive person,
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.320]   you can use your business as a form of influence,
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.180]   which is what people do.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:11.360]   So if Mar-a-Lago has paid $200,000 to a photographer,
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.840]   right, that's a useful thing.
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.400]   You choose a photographer that you like,
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.000]   you choose a photographer that's kind to you,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.720]   that's nice to you, that treats you well.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.800]   You may choose a photographer that's politically connected.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.820]   You may choose a photographer that's the mayor's son,
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:23.920]   or something like that.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.800]   But the brilliance of the Trump organization
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.980]   is that he's built a lifestyle business
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:31.200]   that allows him to live his life
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.200]   and to genuinely live a high-status,
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:41.840]   high-consumption lifestyle in a very tax-efficient way.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.240]   That's the power of it.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.480]   And that's what's open to you and to me,
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.880]   which is why I've continually encouraged you
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.360]   that everybody should have a business
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.760]   and that businesses should not have a sole goal
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.040]   of producing profit.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.400]   It should have and must,
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.000]   in order to be a legitimate business,
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.800]   have a goal of producing profit,
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.780]   but it should also provide for you a pleasant lifestyle,
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.680]   a lifestyle that you enjoy.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.980]   You can do this with your own company, right?
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:08.260]   You can do this with your own multinational company.
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:09.700]   If you have a multinational company
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:13.060]   that has business affairs in London and Australia
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:16.260]   and the Bahamas and New York City,
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:18.580]   well, now your business has every right
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.900]   for it to send you to those places
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.340]   and to pay for your expenses
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:23.900]   and to give you an entertainment budget
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.460]   and a dining budget and an appropriate budget
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:28.180]   for the things that you need.
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.740]   Now, you can't deduct personal clothing, right?
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.420]   That would be an example of what you can't deduct.
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:35.620]   You can't buy custom bespoke suits
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:37.460]   just for you as a normal businessman
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.860]   and deduct it as personal clothing,
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:42.340]   unless that personal clothing relates some way
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:46.580]   to your actual brand, for example, like The Apprentice.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:48.720]   And the rules on some of this stuff get a little bit fuzzy,
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.360]   but if you're a TV personality,
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.280]   the cost of your makeup is certainly part of doing business.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.740]   You don't expect, I don't even know who's on TV anymore.
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.500]   Is Katie Couric still on TV?
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:03.640]   You don't expect your morning news anchor to come to the,
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.940]   you don't have a problem with your morning news anchor
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.960]   on your TV show having a makeup person on staff
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.180]   that prepares their makeup.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.340]   And so if you build a business,
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.020]   like perhaps the Trumps have built,
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.060]   then you can do the same thing.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:17.080]   And so there's an art to this,
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.360]   where you look at your lifestyle and you say,
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.720]   what kind of lifestyle do I want?
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.540]   And then how can I build this lifestyle
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:25.220]   in a tax-efficient way?
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.500]   And so that's what Trump has done with his club,
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:28.340]   even along the way.
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:32.120]   And to me, let me tell a story about the Trump club.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.740]   I don't know if this is true or not.
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.940]   This is just simply gossip that I heard.
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.820]   So a number of years ago,
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.460]   I was out at the Everglades Club with a friend of mine.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.900]   And so if you've never been to Palm Beach,
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:45.820]   Palm Beach is a very exclusive society,
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:47.980]   very hoity-toity, it always has been.
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:50.300]   And it's my hometown.
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:53.140]   And so I spent a lot of time on Palm Beach.
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.140]   I went to school right in downtown West Palm Beach.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.420]   I would walk to the beach in Palm Beach
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:59.540]   when I was in college.
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.260]   And so it's my hometown.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.700]   Worth Avenue is where I would go to walk.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.900]   It's where my friends went to ride skateboards.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.900]   And so down the street.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:11.540]   So a number of years ago, I was at the Everglades Club,
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.060]   which is a private exclusive club.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:14.940]   It's like a country club, but a little bit,
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.220]   it is a country club, but it's a glorified country club.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.460]   And it's one of the places where during season,
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:21.940]   Palm Beach is a very seasonal town during the winter season,
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.980]   where that's where people go to hang out.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:24.820]   And it's really nice.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.780]   It's a lovely experience to go to any of these clubs.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:31.100]   But the story that was told was that Donald Trump
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:32.980]   wanted to join the Everglades Club.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.980]   And again, I am not saying,
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.820]   I don't know if this is true,
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:37.740]   it's gossip that was told to me of the stories.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.380]   Donald Trump wanted to join the Everglades Club.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:44.100]   And unfortunately, nobody wanted him in the club
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:46.380]   because he was too vulgar, right?
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.780]   The Palm Beach society scene is very,
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:52.340]   very much about not being vulgar.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.740]   And he was so vulgar and brash and he was new money.
[01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:55.980]   He wasn't old money.
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:58.420]   And he's very, very vulgar and he's everywhere in the press
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:00.100]   and he's a playboy and all over the place.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.540]   And so he wanted to join the Everglades Club,
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:02.980]   but he couldn't get people to sponsor him
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:04.740]   and they wouldn't approve him for membership.
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:07.100]   And allegedly he tried multiple different clubs.
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.060]   And so he said, "Fine, you're not gonna have me.
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:11.020]   "I'm gonna start my own club."
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.860]   So he bought the, was it the Estee Lauder Estate,
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:15.100]   I think it was Mar-a-Lago.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.220]   So he bought the house that is now Mar-a-Lago,
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:18.420]   the estate that is now Mar-a-Lago,
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.820]   and he started his own club.
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.580]   But he was so stupid with his choice,
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:22.740]   again, the gossip of Palm Beach.
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:24.220]   He was so dumb with his choice
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:26.500]   that he didn't realize that the flight path
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.060]   for Palm Beach International Airport
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.900]   flies right over Mar-a-Lago.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:32.040]   So he bought this big expensive house
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.380]   that is right in the path of the flight path
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:36.220]   of the airplanes.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.580]   So all day long, there's airplanes coming in
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:40.220]   from the Atlantic Ocean, right over the top of Mar-a-Lago
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.420]   to land at Palm Beach International Airport.
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:45.100]   And so he went and he tried to get the laws changed
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.820]   and everything to protect his club.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:51.220]   Now, at the end of the day, nobody wanted to join his club.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:52.960]   So then he started to bring people down to join his club,
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.060]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:56.780]   But it has turned out to be a good investment for him.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.900]   So that's the gossip about the Palm Beachers
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:00.140]   who don't like President Trump
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.240]   and have never liked him because he's vulgar.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.940]   But along the way, if you think about the value
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.260]   of starting a private club,
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:07.900]   there's incredible value to that
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.020]   from a lifestyle perspective.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.620]   If you start a private club,
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.180]   you could have all of the benefits
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.620]   that President Trump has from his private club.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:18.620]   Instead of having to pay fees to the Everglades Club,
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.900]   which in today's world, in today's tax code
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.700]   are basically not deductible, right?
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.900]   There was a time when you could deduct
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:26.340]   more country club dues than now,
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:27.740]   but that's a very hard one to get past.
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:30.580]   So instead of paying your multi-six figure
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.140]   initiation fees to the club
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.620]   and your tens of thousands of dollars a year
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.620]   membership fees, Trump doesn't have that.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:37.060]   He started his own club.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:39.740]   And so instead of it being an expense source for him,
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.860]   it's a revenue source.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:42.980]   And it gives him the ability to own real property,
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.500]   a very beautiful estate,
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.300]   right in a very valuable section of Palm Beach,
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.020]   and to do it in a very efficient way.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:52.260]   So don't hate him for these deductions.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.020]   If the deductions are improper,
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.300]   the IRS will deal with that.
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:58.860]   Copy him from this perspective.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:00.940]   And if there's a high consumption lifestyle
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.340]   thing that you wanna do,
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:05.020]   think about if you can just simply
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.460]   bring that into your life in some way.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.180]   I've talked about, you know,
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:11.100]   at some point I might start a,
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:15.300]   not a coworking space, but a maker space.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.140]   Why?
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:19.420]   Well, I'd love my children to have a fully equipped workshop,
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:23.100]   but I'd rather have my children have a fully equipped
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.020]   workshop that they can work at,
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.340]   not only physically do the work,
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.260]   but also physically put yourself in a place
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.540]   where they can manage it.
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.780]   So I'd rather, if I'm gonna buy a bunch of expensive
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:36.900]   equipment for my children to learn, you know,
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.580]   woodworking equipment and metalworking equipment
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:41.300]   and computers and graphic design, et cetera,
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.060]   I'd rather do that in the form of business.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:45.300]   And I'll capitalize the business,
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:48.020]   but I'll have my children involved in picking it out
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:51.340]   and running it and helping manage it, et cetera.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:53.700]   So now not only do they of course have the ability
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.300]   to use the equipment,
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:58.340]   but now it can be a source of revenue for the family
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:00.180]   and a source of business training,
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:03.020]   rather than just me buying $100,000 worth of equipment
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.100]   to put in a shed out behind my back,
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:08.140]   behind my house for my children to use.
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.300]   And so you can do this on many levels.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.740]   If you wanna start a maker space,
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:13.600]   because you wanna buy a 3D printer,
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.300]   there's no requirement that your business
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:17.460]   has to have 30,000 square feet.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.860]   You can do that right there.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:20.740]   You can just simply start a business
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.940]   and have that business buy a 3D printer
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:24.900]   and have the plan be to start a private club
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:27.340]   where you're gonna rent out time on that 3D printer
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:28.500]   for your children's friends.
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.460]   And now you have the exact same thing
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.460]   that President Trump has with starting his own private club.
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:40.700]   There is a significant section on ethics in this article.
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:41.860]   The ethical quandaries, quote,
[01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:44.660]   "The ethical quandaries created by Mr. Trump's decision
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.420]   to keep his business while in the White House
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.900]   have been documented,
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.340]   but the full financial measure
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:52.220]   of his extraordinary confluence of interests,
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.940]   a president with a wealth of business entanglements at home
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:59.260]   and a myriad geopolitical hotspots has remained elusive.
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:02.220]   The tax records for Mr. Trump and his hundreds of companies
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.500]   show precisely how much money he has received over the years
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.660]   and how heavily he has come to rely on leveraging his brand
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:10.260]   in ways that pose potential or direct conflicts of interest
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.140]   while he is president."
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.060]   This is an area that is very, very concerning,
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:17.060]   is the ethical discussions.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:20.860]   And I do not have a high opinion
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:24.860]   of President Trump's sense of ethics and morality.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:28.820]   It's hard for me to believe that any honest person
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.620]   would look to him as a paragon of human virtue,
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.560]   as somebody who always plays it straight
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.160]   and who always does the right thing no matter what.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.580]   What's bothersome to me
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.180]   is that these ethical problems
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:48.620]   are major risks going forward for every single person,
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:51.980]   not only who inhabits the White House,
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:55.780]   but who inhabits any part of the governmental system.
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:59.780]   And I expect this to continue getting worse.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:01.260]   I'll tell you why.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:06.260]   If you have a society where the government is rather small
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:08.740]   and where the government is not involved
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.200]   in every form of society,
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:14.060]   the government might have a few basic functions.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:15.780]   And if then that society,
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:18.820]   the local government officials
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:21.940]   have very modest power over people's lives,
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:24.420]   then I think you have far fewer ethical problems.
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:29.180]   Imagine, for example, that you live in a county
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:30.860]   that's just a small rural county
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:33.200]   and you have a county commission of four or five people
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.740]   and everyone pays the same tax rate, et cetera.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:38.180]   There's not a lot of incentive
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:40.780]   for every normal individual citizen
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:43.660]   to go and to try to bribe or corrupt
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.100]   the county commissioners.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.660]   Now, there is a big incentive
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:48.780]   for a mega real estate developer
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:51.300]   who wants to come in and open a casino in your county
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:53.640]   to try to bribe the county commission.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.980]   But there's not a lot of incentive for the normal person.
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:56.820]   Why?
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.860]   Well, because the county commission
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.100]   doesn't have that much power.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.740]   They're just there.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:01.780]   They're just part of the government
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:02.820]   and they're a functionary
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.340]   and they don't have a lot of power over the average person.
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:06.780]   And so when you have a small government,
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:11.020]   you have a very small risk of ethical,
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:14.180]   of people trying to buy influence because it's not worth it.
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:16.500]   But when you have a very large government,
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:19.300]   now all of a sudden it becomes much more important
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.340]   to get the government on your side.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.500]   And so as the US government has grown
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:26.700]   and has taken over more and more of the economy,
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:29.380]   and as we've transitioned from a small government,
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.420]   more of a libertarian oriented society,
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:35.340]   to the modern government, which is huge,
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:38.220]   where everybody's involved over the last century,
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:42.140]   this particular change means that the ethics problems
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:45.860]   are much, much more substantial.
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:47.600]   And I expect that to continue to grow.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.900]   As the government continues to grow in power and in scope,
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:53.100]   there's more incentive for normal people
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:57.140]   to influence the government and to try to buy influence.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:00.020]   Most of the time this happens in political contributions.
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:02.660]   President Trump famously giving money to everybody, right?
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:04.300]   That's normal for many business people
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:06.860]   to give money to the people who are involved.
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:09.400]   And then it happens in terms of employment opportunities.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.900]   You see the revolving door
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:14.620]   between the government and Wall Street.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:15.740]   You see the revolving door
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:18.180]   between lobbyist firms and government.
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:20.220]   And if you can succeed in getting into government
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:23.420]   at a high level, you basically can write your ticket
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.300]   to a very profitable life.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:28.500]   If you get elected to Congress for a few years,
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:31.060]   you can parlay that, if you're politically savvy,
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:35.060]   you can parlay that into becoming a lobbyist.
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:37.780]   At the moment, there's no real laws against that.
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:39.460]   And the role of a lobbyist,
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.220]   it's hard to think of a cushier job, right?
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:45.540]   If I said, I'll pay you $850,000 a year,
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.580]   and you need to live in a comfortable house
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:49.260]   in a great metropolitan area,
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.380]   Washington, DC is just a lovely place to live
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:53.020]   from a cultural perspective.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:55.820]   And your job is to talk to people.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:58.420]   You're gonna have an entertainment and expense budget
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:01.020]   of $100,000 a year.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.140]   You can use that going to all the finest restaurants,
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:04.820]   taking people around.
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:06.580]   I mean, to me, that's a dream job, right?
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:08.300]   That's the kind of thing that would be so fun.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.140]   And so if you don't have moral reservations
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.540]   about what you're doing, it's a really fun job.
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:18.340]   I've thought many times about, well, is there a cause
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.820]   that I could just get behind so much
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:20.900]   that I'd be willing to go and do it?
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.020]   It's a cushy job.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:23.660]   And so that's an example of how legally
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:26.940]   you can leverage political power and exposure
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:30.340]   into a lifetime employment
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.420]   in a very fun and cushy type of work.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:38.020]   And so that temptation is there for all politicians now.
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:42.500]   You have to be really, either really straight,
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.220]   you have to be like a Ron Paul or a Thomas Massey
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.100]   or somebody really abrasive like that
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:49.500]   who has these really hardcore opinions,
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.460]   not to leverage that.
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.560]   And even in those situations,
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.780]   you'll still leverage your name, right?
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:56.640]   Ron Paul has a successful TV organization
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.420]   where he opines on subjects that are important to him.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.940]   And so you can leverage political businesses,
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.500]   political, excuse me, Freudian slip there.
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.340]   You can leverage political engagement
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.940]   and government service into a fortune.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.540]   I did a show on that a year or so ago
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:12.100]   where I talked about how you can do that
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:12.940]   and even for your children.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:15.100]   Now you're connected, your children are connected.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.380]   It's one of the, it's a really good investment.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:19.060]   If you invest a few years of your life
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.500]   into getting that low salary of a congressman,
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.980]   you can then leverage that into a lifetime of ease
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.500]   and riches for yourself down the road.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.860]   And from a presidential perspective,
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:33.640]   this is even more true, more powerful.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.680]   I think you could see this very clearly
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.500]   in President Bill Clinton.
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:41.640]   When he and Hillary Clinton left office,
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:44.320]   they said we're broke, right?
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.280]   We're totally broke.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.040]   But then just a very short time later,
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.280]   they were once again doing very well financially,
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.200]   multi, multi, multi millionaires.
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.180]   And so you see this with expensive speeches.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.980]   You see this with all of the stuff.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.580]   And it's almost impossible not to believe
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:03.460]   that the politicians who leave that
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:06.240]   don't continue to exercise their leverage.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.380]   They just certainly do.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:10.820]   And so there are enough ways for you to whitewash the money
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:14.120]   through handsome speaking fees, et cetera,
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.860]   book engagements, et cetera,
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:18.420]   that basically the ticket when you're a president,
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:21.900]   the presidency is a ticket to lifetime of wealth
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:22.980]   for anybody.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:25.380]   Even somebody without a business,
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:27.620]   a former business scenario,
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:30.300]   somebody like President Clinton or President Obama,
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.560]   it's a lifetime ticket to massive wealth forever.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.180]   Now, when you take someone like President Trump
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:37.820]   who has all these business interests,
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.680]   I don't see how he,
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.820]   regardless of whether he wins or loses in the next election,
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.140]   I don't see how he doesn't transform this
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:49.140]   into untold wealth.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:50.060]   Whether that's in,
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.620]   it's rumored that he's gonna take over
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:54.860]   the news network or a TV network
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.980]   and have the Trump TV network,
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:57.860]   something like the One America News Network,
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:00.400]   maybe so, it'd be a smart move for him
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.940]   to do that financially.
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:03.260]   I don't know how he'll leverage it,
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:06.060]   but somebody like him who everything is built on brand
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:07.660]   will certainly leverage it.
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:11.440]   And so I think the ethics concerns are without question,
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:17.060]   without question troubling
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:21.940]   because it's just a very, very big pot of money
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:23.900]   for anybody to have to walk away from.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:27.780]   But there's no evidence in the story
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:30.860]   that President Trump has crossed
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:34.680]   any of the legal ethic lines, ethics lines.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.520]   There's no evidence of it.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.020]   Wouldn't surprise me if there were,
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.740]   but I think it's notable that there's not.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.140]   In all this story, after years of people saying,
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:42.700]   if we could just get access to his tax records,
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:46.620]   that'll show how dirty he is.
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:49.060]   In my opinion, he's cleaner than I expected.
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:51.140]   Let's wrap it up with the final section of the article
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.700]   called "The Gathering Storm,"
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.740]   the headline from the New York Times.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:56.540]   Threats are converging, mounting business losses,
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:58.220]   the looming IRS audit,
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.520]   and personally guaranteed debts coming due.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:07.700]   I think that case is unproven would be at best.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:11.420]   I think that's more of a point of wishing.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.860]   I think it's unproven.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:15.240]   And I would say that it's just gonna depend, right?
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.540]   There's not enough context here.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.420]   We don't know enough, yes, okay,
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.660]   he's gonna have loans coming due.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.260]   We don't know what the revenue is of those businesses.
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:24.780]   We don't know what the worth of those businesses are.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:28.100]   And so the idea here of the New York Times writers
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:32.360]   is Mr. Trump is likely to wield his influence unethically
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.620]   because he's in financial trouble, maybe so.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:38.320]   I wouldn't say that's impossible,
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.740]   but I think that it's unproven.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:46.740]   And if you understand the basic ideas of business,
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.520]   I think that this will be evidence.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:50.160]   Let me show you how I would analyze this
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.320]   through a business lens.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:54.140]   Now his tax records, quote,
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.340]   "Now his tax records make clear
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.480]   "that he is facing a battery of threats to his business
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:59.280]   "and his own financial wellbeing.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.920]   "Over the past decade,
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.740]   "he appears to have filled the cashflow gaps
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:05.060]   "with a series of one-shots
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.960]   "that may not be available again.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.940]   "In 2012, he took out a $100 million mortgage
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:12.660]   "on the commercial space in Trump Tower."
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:16.540]   Now the idea of the New York Times writer here
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:19.000]   is that this is a sign of financial distress,
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.880]   but we don't know if it's a sign of financial distress.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.120]   It may be very well that he needed some cash,
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.380]   and so he took out the $100 million mortgage,
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.160]   and that's what you do when you wanna spend money
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.220]   from a real estate portfolio in a tax-efficient way,
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.540]   you use debt.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:34.640]   Money that you get from borrowing is not taxable income.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:36.680]   But who knows?
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.820]   Then they go on, quote,
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:40.520]   "He took nearly the entire amount as a payout,
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.700]   "his tax records show.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:44.040]   "His company has paid more than $15 million in interest
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:45.800]   "on the loan, but nothing on the principal.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:49.920]   "The full $100 million comes due in 2022."
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:53.840]   So an example like this is supposed to say
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.880]   he's in financial trouble.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:57.640]   I look at it and I say, he wanted to spend money,
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.720]   he needed money, and so you take a loan out,
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.220]   that's tax-free income.
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:05.540]   The $15 million in interest is a deductible expense
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:07.680]   'cause he's in the business of real estate.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.280]   So with his wealth, that's a 50% discount.
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:19.040]   There's a good chance that the building has grown in value
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.180]   or is continuing to grow in value,
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:24.320]   so he can easily justify the interest expense
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.800]   on his balance sheet.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:29.080]   And the fact that the $100 million loan comes due in 2022
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.360]   tells us nothing because we don't know what it's worth,
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.960]   we don't know what his lender is saying.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.680]   If the lender is dealing with Donald Trump,
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.960]   who has a reputation for companies in bankruptcy,
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.040]   who's famously a billion dollars in debt in the 1990s,
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:41.280]   you would think that they would properly
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.520]   collateralize their loan.
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:43.440]   But at the end of the day,
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:45.840]   that's their choice of what they do.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:48.920]   And even if he was foreclosed on one property,
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.320]   as is abundantly clear from his past business dealings,
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:55.000]   he understands the benefit of having your risk segregated.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.800]   And so if he couldn't pay the loan, what do you do?
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:58.640]   If you're a billionaire
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.440]   and you can't pay a $100 million loan,
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:02.560]   well, you let the bank take the property
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.560]   and foreclose on the property.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.920]   And if you're personally liable,
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.120]   you sell something else to pay the loan.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:10.160]   It's not the same as an average person
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:13.200]   who's earning $50,000 at a job
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:16.240]   and has $100,000 of debt,
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.160]   of student loan debt or something like that.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:21.600]   So they go on and talk about his sales, but it's unclear.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.520]   So why he is selling, it's unproven.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.560]   So at the very best case, it's unproven.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.800]   And I think that it's valuable to show
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:35.560]   that even in what the New York Times is talking about.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:38.280]   So they're saying that, quote,
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:40.640]   "What's more, the tax records show that Mr. Trump
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.360]   "has once again done what he says he regrets,
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.720]   "looking back on his early 1990s meltdown,
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:46.600]   "personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.620]   "in loans, a decision that led his lenders
[01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:50.720]   "to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:52.600]   "This time around, he is personally responsible
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.980]   "for loans and other debts totaling $421 million,
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:58.480]   "with most of it coming due within four years.
[01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.600]   "Should he win re-election,
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.020]   "his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:04.560]   "of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.800]   "There is, however, a tax benefit for Mr. Trump.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.780]   "While business owners can use losses to avoid taxes,
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.540]   "they can do so only up to the amount
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:12.660]   "invested in the business.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:14.360]   "But by taking personal responsibility
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.800]   "for that $421 million in debt,
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.840]   "Mr. Trump would be able to declare that amount in losses
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.800]   "in future years."
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.400]   So at the very end of the article,
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.160]   we see that there are very good reasons
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.540]   to understand why he might have a $750 tax bill.
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:36.400]   This article was a 32-page article
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.800]   in my PDF version of it from the website.
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:41.320]   I don't know what it was in the print edition.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.400]   But what I would point here,
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.200]   I would point out to you here,
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:50.200]   is that let's assume that you have one set of facts.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.200]   Right, you have one set of tax returns.
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.420]   And let's assume that the IRS has the genuine tax returns.
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:02.320]   I don't know that President Trump is a great businessman.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:05.080]   I'm not convinced he is.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.420]   If I were making a list of the top 10 businessmen
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:12.100]   of all time, I don't think I would put him on that list.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:16.780]   I think that his brand is a whole lot of flash
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:18.020]   and a whole lot of show.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:23.100]   And I really wonder about the substance behind it.
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:26.020]   But sometimes I look at all kinds of businesses
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.820]   and I think, how on earth did this happen?
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:32.540]   And you wonder, right, you wonder.
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:36.900]   What I'm personally convinced is that
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:40.380]   President Trump has phenomenal instincts.
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:41.220]   And
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:50.140]   he has the ability to wheel and deal
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:53.300]   in the midst of circumstances that would crush me
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.020]   and to trust his instincts in a way
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:56.660]   that to me is very inspiring.
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:01.660]   I watched, I guess a couple months ago,
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:03.100]   I watched an interview, a long interview,
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:05.020]   I think it was PBS had done this long interview
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.380]   with Steve Bannon.
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:10.020]   And they released the entire uncut interview
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:11.740]   with Steve Bannon on YouTube.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.560]   And it was two hours, two and a half hours
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.520]   of just uncut Steve Bannon talking very openly
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.820]   about his experiences with President Trump.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:21.700]   And it opened my eyes in a really remarkable way
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:23.300]   to some of the inside stuff that was happening
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.100]   during the 2016 presidential campaign.
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:29.540]   And the thing that I, just convinced me of
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.060]   is that President Trump was a fighter
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.900]   and that he just has these instincts.
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:35.980]   And he doesn't, he seemingly has no shame.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:40.980]   He's not controlled by the sense of propriety or dignity
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:43.900]   or the sense of reputation
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:47.060]   that I'm controlled by personally.
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.700]   And he seems to have been able just throughout his life
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:54.700]   to live this incredible, incredibly wealthy life
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:03:01.260]   without, and weathered things that would sink me.
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:04.020]   I mean, three marriages and bankruptcies here
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:05.180]   and business deals there,
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:07.060]   and the sheer amount of political abuse he gets
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:08.660]   is just stunning to me.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:12.800]   And so I think that in this article,
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.220]   you can view, assume everything is true in this article.
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:18.740]   You can view this article in either way.
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:21.180]   I don't think this is gonna convince anybody
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:22.020]   one way or the other.
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.020]   I don't think that this article
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:25.380]   is gonna convince any lefties
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:27.860]   that somehow President Trump is this brilliant businessman
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:29.700]   because Joshua explained all these tax details
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:31.380]   that show that actually,
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:33.980]   actually he's just really smart.
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.940]   I think a lefty will read this and be convinced
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:39.320]   that he's in moral danger,
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.300]   that he's gonna commit all kinds of ethical breaches.
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:43.620]   I think a lefty says, well, look,
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:46.140]   he's lied constantly about his wealth.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.580]   He's not as rich as he was.
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:49.060]   And there was all these shady deals
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:51.780]   and he's gonna have to pay the IRS $100 million.
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:53.380]   And I think a lefty will see that.
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:56.160]   I think a righty will look at this and say,
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:58.580]   it's cleaner than I thought.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:00.180]   This is cleaner than I expected.
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:03.580]   This is cleaner than I expected personally.
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:05.660]   So I think a righty will probably look at it and say,
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:06.540]   that's cleaner than I thought.
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:07.800]   Look, he's not doing anything illegal.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:10.140]   Look, the audit is not, it's just like he said.
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:14.300]   Plus we knew that all these other things about him.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:16.380]   So I don't know that this will convince anything
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:18.460]   or move the political needle, who knows.
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:19.700]   The New York Times has promised
[02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.100]   that there are more articles coming,
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:22.900]   but I can't imagine that there's gonna be anything
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.020]   more explosive along the way.
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:27.740]   Just more details that probably won't help at all.
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:30.820]   So my hope as I finish is that you will learn
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:33.580]   from this example.
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:36.620]   Because regardless of whether you admire somebody
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:39.620]   or despise somebody, we can all learn from people.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:42.260]   And I think an intelligent, mature way to approach people
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:45.580]   that you have disagreements with
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:47.660]   is to look at what they're doing
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:49.340]   and learn from what they're doing.
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:51.780]   And say, what can I take that I admire
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:55.300]   and what can I take from why someone is successful?
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:56.620]   And so what I would point out to you
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:59.060]   is there's a lot of tax lessons here.
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:01.380]   Number one, you see the value of real estate.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:06.380]   Real estate, because of its ability to grow over time,
[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:10.020]   to take significant depreciation expenses
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:13.260]   and to generate modest amounts of income,
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:15.620]   it can be a very tax-efficient thing to do.
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:17.620]   For someone like a real estate developer,
[02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:20.260]   you can put together this dream life, right?
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:24.340]   Where you're at all the finest clubs 'cause you own them.
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:27.020]   You eat at all the finest hotels 'cause you own them, right?
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:28.660]   And everything is related.
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:30.580]   And you can do that with any number of businesses
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:32.260]   to build a very tax-efficient life.
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:34.700]   And I hope that you will take that
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:37.100]   and you'll think about how you can apply that.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:38.900]   I don't personally have any ambitions
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:42.020]   of being a billionaire real estate developer.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:44.900]   But I do like to live a very tax-efficient life.
[02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:47.880]   And I'm proud of my low tax returns.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:51.940]   One of the things that bothers me is on this subject,
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:53.820]   there is hypocrisy on all sides.
[02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:57.780]   Nobody believes in paying taxes, even if they say they do.
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.340]   I have never had somebody prove to me,
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.900]   the most virulent, we need to increase tax people,
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:07.020]   I have never had somebody prove to me
[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:08.800]   that they believed in paying taxes enough
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:10.340]   to send extra money to the government.
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:11.460]   Nobody does it.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.420]   Everybody pays the bare minimum.
[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:17.420]   And so on this issue, everyone's a hypocrite,
[02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:20.100]   even the most loud mouth people that are public, right?
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:22.940]   You see someone like, what was the big debate
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:23.780]   five years ago?
[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:26.020]   Warren Buffett says, we need to have a wealth tax.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:28.180]   We need to have millionaires pay their fair share.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.500]   And after all, I, Warren Buffett,
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.760]   pay less money than my secretary does.
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:35.500]   And of course, that was a sleight of hand
[02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:38.660]   because what he meant was a lower rate on wealth
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:40.380]   because of dividends and capital gains
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:42.780]   versus earned income.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.820]   But even in a situation like that, what does Buffett do?
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:47.960]   Does Buffett say, well, I believe in paying taxes so much
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:50.620]   that I'm gonna stroke a check for an extra,
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:52.620]   $50 million a year to the US government?
[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:54.100]   No, he doesn't.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.660]   Does Buffett believe in taxes so much that he says,
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:58.620]   well, what I'm gonna do is when I die,
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.420]   I'm gonna give the money to my children
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:03.280]   and then I'll go ahead and allow the US government
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.640]   to get a few extra billion dollars in estate taxes?
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:06.500]   Not a chance.
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:07.340]   What does Buffett do?
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:08.800]   Buffett says, I'm gonna give all my money
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:11.220]   to my buddy Bill Gates Foundation.
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:15.420]   And so in that situation, you have the most outspoken people
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.460]   and I'm using him as a public example,
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:18.860]   the most outspoken spoken people saying
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:20.180]   we need to re-improve taxes,
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:25.180]   but they never even take the first step of paying extra,
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:27.540]   which any of us can do, right?
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.580]   The IRS publishes its voluntary contribution.
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:32.260]   You can designate your money to pay down the national debt.
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:34.740]   But we all know that it's a waste of time,
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:37.220]   that taxes are a rotten use of money.
[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:40.440]   And so we all pay the least possible.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:42.920]   So I believe you should pay your taxes.
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:44.920]   I believe it's too big of a risk not to.
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:48.660]   And so if you don't wanna pay taxes and you're an American,
[02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:50.640]   I would encourage you to not become an American.
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:53.300]   That's a process that I have been,
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:56.640]   that's a process that I have been preparing for myself
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:59.600]   because I think it's absolutely insane
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:01.520]   that somebody would be an effective businessman
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:04.520]   and run a high profit business that,
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:06.860]   and then have 40% of the profits sucked up
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:09.380]   by a government organization.
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:11.700]   And so you can't do it as American,
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:14.340]   but you can do it as a non-American.
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:16.340]   And so I think that's worth considering.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:19.040]   But at the end of the day, you should follow these strategies
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:20.460]   and you should build a life
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:22.340]   that gives you the appropriate lifestyle, right?
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:24.460]   That provides you with everything
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:25.700]   that you and your family want,
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:27.900]   and that does it in a very efficient way.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:30.660]   And I hope that some of the details
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:33.420]   on some of the stuff that's in this article helps you.
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:35.880]   Very long show, but it was a 32 page article
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:37.100]   and I wanted to use it as an example.
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:38.760]   So thank you for listening to Radical Personal Finance.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:42.440]   As I close, I would remind you that if you've enjoyed this,
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:45.320]   you may enjoy some of my other educational programs.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:49.280]   Let me point out, let me highlight for you two.
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:51.240]   I'd highlight number one is that I teach a course
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.880]   called How to Borrow Money Safely
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:55.080]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.280]   And you'll notice the importance of debt
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:00.300]   in what we've talked about.
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:01.920]   You'll notice that I've said several times
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:04.800]   that debt is not taxable income.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.160]   And so if you understand that,
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.040]   then you can use that knowledge to structure your life
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.680]   in a way that provides you
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:16.520]   with a very tax efficient lifestyle.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.700]   So in the example I gave of the real estate investor,
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:21.120]   how would that real estate investor
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:24.120]   who buys that property for $150,000 and wants to fix it up,
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:26.240]   how would they live in the time that they're fixing it up?
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:27.080]   Well, if they go get a job,
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:28.800]   they're gonna pay a lot of money in tax.
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:31.240]   But if they use credit cards
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.640]   for their personal living expenses, that's not income.
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.440]   And then if they fix their property up,
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:39.180]   then they can, and then they refinance it with a mortgage,
[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:40.800]   they can pay off the credit card debt.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:43.120]   Now, this kind of game can be very risky.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:44.000]   And there are a lot of people
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.600]   who have lost their shirt doing it.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.200]   And so I don't wanna gloss over the importance
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.000]   of being very careful and thoughtful
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.880]   in how you do things like this.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.600]   But it is absolutely doable.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:58.560]   And so debt that you take out is never income.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.600]   And debt can be a way of providing for yourself
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.080]   while you're waiting for your deductions
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:04.160]   to become available.
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.440]   And so debt has a very valuable place
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.340]   in a good financial planner's arsenal.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:12.660]   And so there have been times
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:14.080]   that I have used these strategies
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:15.440]   to help bridge the tax gap.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.840]   So I've consulted with clients
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:18.280]   and they wanted to retire early
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.040]   and they were gonna take money out of a retirement account,
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:22.320]   but they needed to bridge the gap with extra expenses.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.880]   And so something like this, using credit cards can be,
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.040]   if you understand the game
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.340]   and understand how to moderate the risk,
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:31.760]   can be a way of doing that in a very tax efficient way.
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:34.640]   So recognize that mortgages and credit cards, et cetera,
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.480]   are part of that.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:36.840]   And so I would encourage, if you're interested in that course
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:38.400]   or any of the other courses that I share,
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:39.400]   that I have to share,
