[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.080]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.000]   with longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   Lots of questions come into our inbox on eternity
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.440]   and heaven, including this really perceptive one
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.840]   from a podcast listener named Lisa.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.360]   Pastor John, what is the reward that we will receive
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.080]   above and beyond finally getting to see Christ
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.800]   face to face, to be with him, the lover of our soul
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.240]   forever in eternity?
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.640]   Isn't he enough reward himself
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.680]   or will there be other rewards besides him?
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.000]   If God is the gospel and God is the prize of eternity,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   how and why would all the other crowns and gifts
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500]   motivate us towards heaven?
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.640]   - Lisa's instincts here are very good.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.360]   It's right to say, isn't Christ enough?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.280]   And the reason I say that's a good instinct
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.920]   is because it's the instinct of the psalmist.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.360]   And it's the instinct of Paul.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.320]   The psalmist says, "Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400]   And there's nothing on earth I desire besides you."
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.680]   Psalm 73, 25, which is the heart that I hear
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.360]   coming out of Lisa's mouth.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.400]   And Paul says in Philippians 3, 8,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   "Indeed, I count everything as loss
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus."
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.840]   Christ Jesus, my Lord.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.440]   But here's the catch.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.440]   God knows best how we can know Christ most completely
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.560]   and enjoy Christ most fully.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.400]   And all the biblical pointers lead us to believe
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.100]   that Christ is revealed more fully
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.120]   when he is revealed not only immediately
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   to the eyes of the heart by the Holy Spirit
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.400]   because of his moral and spiritual excellencies,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   but also when he is revealed immediately
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.040]   through things that he has made
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   and things that he has done in creation,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.420]   physical creation, things which we experience
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.520]   in our own created physical bodies,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   not only in our created spiritual souls.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.600]   That's why God created a material universe,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   and he created the earth,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.240]   and he created us with physical bodies
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.800]   and capacities to experience good
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   through the created material existence.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.260]   So the Bible says we are to eat and drink
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.820]   and do everything in our physical bodies
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.500]   to the glory of God,
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.660]   which must mean that the pleasures of God
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.420]   or the pleasures that God has built in
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.860]   to the taste of food are not designed primarily
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.140]   as competitors with God's beauty,
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.140]   but designed as means of its communication.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.400]   He's communicating something of himself
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.200]   in the good creation that he has made.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.360]   And so the creation becomes one of the ways
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.880]   that we taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   And then the Bible makes it plain
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.800]   that this is not only true now,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.600]   but will also be true in the resurrection.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.040]   In fact, that's why there is a resurrection
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   of the body and not just the immortality of the soul.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Jesus was at pains, wasn't he,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   to persuade us or persuade his doubting disciples
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.320]   that they were not seeing a ghost.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.300]   They were not just looking at a spirit.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.600]   He said, "See my hands, my feet?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.120]   It is I myself.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   Touch me and see,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.000]   for a spirit does not have flesh and bones
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.800]   as you see that I have."
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   So he has today a physical body in heaven.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.040]   The physical body has been united
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.440]   to the second person of the Trinity
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.240]   with a human and divine nature in one person,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.760]   stunning, amazing, unbelievable almost.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.160]   And then Paul builds on that reality
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.680]   by stressing that we ourselves
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.520]   will be raised physically from the dead.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.960]   And he does it by saying our resurrection
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   is all of a piece with Jesus' bodily resurrection.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.720]   First Corinthians 15, 20.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.200]   Christ has been raised from the dead,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.060]   the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.620]   That means we're all one physical material harvest,
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.080]   Christ and us.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.640]   And then, isn't it amazing that in Philippians 1, 23,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.780]   Paul says that to die and be with Christ
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.900]   is far better than anything on the earth.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.080]   So Christ himself, Christ himself,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.520]   and fellowship with him is enough.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.660]   It's enough.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.660]   Yes, and yet in chapter three,
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.660]   he stresses how he longs not just to die and be with Christ,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.900]   but be raised bodily from the dead.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.580]   He says in 310, "Oh, that I may know him
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.020]   "and the power of his resurrection
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.260]   "and may share his sufferings,
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.860]   "becoming like him in his death,
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.260]   "that by any means possible,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.260]   "I may attain the resurrection from the dead."
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.780]   You know, wouldn't that imply,
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.780]   if you put that together with 1, 23,
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.940]   where he says to die and leave the body
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.020]   and go be with Christ is far better,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.020]   wouldn't that imply that the way we experience Christ
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.300]   most fully after death is through relating to him
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.180]   in our new resurrection body and his resurrection body?
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.620]   Else, why would Paul care so much
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.900]   about being raised from the dead
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.740]   if it didn't help him experience Christ more fully?
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.780]   And I think it also implies, doesn't it,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.640]   that the new world of the resurrection,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.340]   the world we live in,
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.040]   must be suited for resurrection bodies,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.160]   not just eternal spirits.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.940]   And isn't that exactly what Paul points out
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.740]   in Romans 8, 19 to 23?
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.980]   And John points out in Revelation 21, 1 to 4,
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.100]   that our new bodies should have a new earth
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   and a new heaven in which to live out our bodily existence.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.980]   Here's the way Paul puts it, I love this.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.740]   Oh, this is so amazing.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.340]   "The creation waits with eager longing."
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.460]   The whole creation is waiting with eager longing
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.400]   "for the revealing of the sons of God.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.780]   "For the creation was subjected to futility."
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.980]   Oh, yes, it was, it's all around us.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.360]   "Not willingly, but because of him who subjected in hope."
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.440]   What hope?
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.180]   "That the creation itself would be set free
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.820]   "from its bondage to corruption."
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.660]   Why?
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.560]   "To obtain the freedom of the glory
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.860]   "of the children of God."
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.640]   Now, I take that to mean that the whole creation
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.140]   will be adapted to be a perfect dwelling
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.820]   for the children of God,
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.820]   so that it functions perfectly to reveal Christ
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.120]   and to be the means by which we will most fully enjoy Christ.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.160]   So here's my answer to Lisa's question.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.280]   Christ indeed is our reward.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.820]   Yes, yes, yes, Lisa, you got that right.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.820]   And, this is and, see if you think this is wrong.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.760]   Christ is indeed our reward,
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   and everything else morally and spiritually
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.180]   and physically inside us and outside us,
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.660]   in the universe, crowns, stars, cities, health,
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.620]   friends, family, great saints, et cetera,
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.620]   everything else with him that will maximize
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.620]   the communication of his glory and our happiness in it
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.620]   through, in him, through it.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.140]   Now, if God thought that Christ could be known
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.580]   most completely and enjoyed most fully
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.180]   by being the solitary object of our awareness,
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.900]   with no created reality as means,
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.180]   I don't think God would have created a material universe
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.260]   in the first place, but only immaterial souls.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.060]   He didn't do it that way,
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.520]   and he's not going to do it that way in the future.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.900]   And so Christ is our reward,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.220]   and everything else is our reward
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.220]   that more fully reveals him
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.120]   and more fully enables us to enjoy him.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.020]   - Amen, that's a nice little theology
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.860]   of the material universe as well.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.780]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.580]   And if you have a question of your own like Lisa did,

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.180]   Well, on Wednesday, we hear from a young man
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.180]   who feels called to the nations on mission,
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.780]   but there's only one problem.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.180]   His parents believe that for him to leave for the nations
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.260]   would be to turn his back
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.580]   on all the God-given blessings of America.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.900]   Now stuck between following a calling
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.140]   and honoring his parents, what should he do?
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.040]   John Piper will apply decades of pastoral wisdom
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.260]   and experience to that situation on Wednesday.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.140]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.300]   (upbeat music)
